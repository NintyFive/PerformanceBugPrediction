I guess I dropped the ball... \ndo you wanna open another PR and add it back similar to `IndexModule#addIndexEventListener(IndexEventListener listener)` there are also tests for this in `IndexModuleTests`. Your other PR looked awesome, I would be looking forward to you adding that missing API back too?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/203331043","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17333#issuecomment-203331043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17333","id":203331043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzMzMTA0Mw==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-30T08:56:32Z","updated_at":"2016-03-30T08:56:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI - nI was working on a similar functionality for search and added a register method on master for the `IndexingOperationListener` in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/17398\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
