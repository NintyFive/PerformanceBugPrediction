Sandboxing was disabled by default from `1.4.3` on though since we found out that it could be worked around (see also https://www.elastic.co/blog/running-groovy-scripts-without-dynamic-scripting).\n\nAt this point I wonder if it makes sense to maintain the sandboxing that we currently have, as we know it's not effective. I would vote for just stating that groovy is not sandboxed and remove all the sandboxing shenanigans from master (2.0), unless we have a better idea for safe sandboxing... especially once we got #10116 in.\n\nThoughts?\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
