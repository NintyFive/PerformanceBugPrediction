comment over from #4614 \n\nWith the removal of _aliases (#4539) we've lost an endpoint for efficiently listing available indices & aliases, which Kibana relies on for computing timestamped indices.\n\nIt would be nice to have an _indices endpoint that could efficiently return a list of indices with a configurable amount of additional granularity, eg mappings, settings, aliases. \n\nBonus points if we could support wildcard matching here for both index and alias names, eg\n\n*\\* Every index name **\n\n```\n/_indices\n```\n\n*\\* Every index with its aliases and settings
