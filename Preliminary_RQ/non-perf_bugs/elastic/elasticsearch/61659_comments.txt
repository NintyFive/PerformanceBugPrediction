Introducing a new syntax for a parameter declaration for a function inside the language seems overkill to me.\r\nWe already have the function for matching, `some.field == /some.regex/` is just syntactic sugar, \r\n\r\nThe vast majority of regular expressions do not use `\"` so there should be little difference between `match(/some.regex/)` or `match(\"some.regex\")`. Further more by scoping the string to the match function, we have flexibility in the supported format such as Unicode escaping.
