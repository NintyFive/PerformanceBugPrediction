There's get-mapping, get-field-mapping, and field-stats.  I'd like to get rid of get-field-mapping in its current form as it doesn't quite do the job.  Perhaps we need to replace get-field-mapping with the mapping aspects of field-stats, and then make field-stats JUST about the stats?\r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5368","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/276106905","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22438#issuecomment-276106905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22438","id":276106905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjEwNjkwNQ==","user":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-30T16:16:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T16:16:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Coming up with some sort of solution to this (though not necessarily what the title of the issue says) is very important for the user experience of the machine learning UI.\r\n\r\nThe problem for ml is that when you create a new job we're in the situation of knowing there are going to be certain fields in the results eventually, but not having any results at the instant the job is created.  We'd like to set up Kibana to be able to visualise our results as soon as they exist, but at present this is not possible because of the fact that Kibana is using the field stats API to populate its index pattern mappings and the field stats API doesn't return what Kibana needs for fields that don't exist in any indexed document.\r\n\r\ncc @peteharverson @jgowdyelastic @sophiec20","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/276459451","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22438#issuecomment-276459451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22438","id":276459451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjQ1OTQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T19:06:31Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T19:06:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jimczi is working on a new field-capabilities API which will rely only on mapping, not on stats (or which docs are indexed).
