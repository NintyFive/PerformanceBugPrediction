We are using multi-part uploading and its equivalents on all three implementations (S3, GCS, Azure) so there really is no need to artificially chunk files at all.\r\n\r\nFor S3 you could make an argument to chunk files because third party implementations of S3 might not like very large blobs. \r\n\r\nFor GCS and Azure I think we should simply set the chunk size to the maximum size allowed by the services by default (5T and 4T respectively). This will speed up restores of large files, keep the blob count in the repository lower (waste less resources on iterating through shard directories on deletes for example).\r\n\r\n=> Is there any reason to keep the manual chunking around? If not we should go ahead with optimizing this. The longer we keep this kind of chunking the more slow snapshots/repositories we create.","closed_by":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
