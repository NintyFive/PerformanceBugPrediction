The bwc builds don't pick up the artifact because it is build with `-beta1` in the version. The bwc build doesn't notice this and when the upgrade tests go to run they don't have anything to upgrade from. The way I see it we could either:\r\n1. Remove the alphas and betas from the upgrade tests again.\r\n2. Fix the bwc build to pick up the alphas and betas correctly and convince the upgrade tests to pick them up as well.\r\n\r\nBoth are fairly simple, but would require scanning the suffix into the build's Version class or building another list in the root build file, this time without alphas trying to stand in for unreleased versions.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/320089011","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26017#issuecomment-320089011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26017","id":320089011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDA4OTAxMQ==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-03T21:01:12Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T21:01:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I guess making the gradle Version class understand alpha/beta/rc is necessary.
