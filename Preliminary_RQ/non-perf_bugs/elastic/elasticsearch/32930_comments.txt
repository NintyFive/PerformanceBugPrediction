A nested field could have multiple values (just like an array), another nested field could have an array of values as well (of different size likely). In SQL terms there are rows and columns in the result, meaning a flat data structure like a matrix.\r\n\r\nFor an index with one document, with a single `nested` field (let's call it `my_nested_field`) that has 7 values and a simple field (non-nested and having a single value, let's call it `my_simple_field`), ES-SQL shows you 7 rows where the value of `my_simple_field` is repeated 7 times and on each row you see each value from the `my_nested_field` field.\r\n\r\nThe current limitation is that using multiple nested fields, there is no solution (yet) for flattening a combination of nested fields in the matrix-like representation I mentioned before.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/414520565","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32930#issuecomment-414520565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32930","id":414520565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDUyMDU2NQ==","user":{"login":"spinwang","id":5768133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjgxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5768133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinwang","html_url":"https://github.com/spinwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinwang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-21T01:33:13Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T01:33:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks @astefan! \r\n\r\nJust curious if there plan to identify a solution in the near future?
