None of the field mappers throw an error if they encounter a field that they don't recognise.  I think this is because the scope of the settings for a field is wider than the mapper for it's type.\n\nIn the same object in the mappings (as in these are not split into sub-objects) we have the type declaration, the settings common to all fields (such as store, etc) and the type specific settings. So the field mapper for a particular type does not know at the moment whether a setting it doesn't recognise is an invalid setting or if it is a valid setting that something else will deal with.\n\nI think we should probably open a separate more generalised issue for this and close this issue. what do you think?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/51617851","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7128#issuecomment-51617851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7128","id":51617851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjE3ODUx","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T15:35:34Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T15:35:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing in favour of #7205 \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
