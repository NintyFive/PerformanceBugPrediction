Types of English strings Elasticsearch provides now: error messages, deprecation warnings, ...?\r\n\r\nThere many ways we could chose to format this identifier, but instead of using error code numbers, I propose that we use human-readable, namespaced strings. For example, in the Deprecations Info API (GET `_xpack/migration/deprecations`) we could add an attribute to each returned deprecation (\"errors\" in this sense) like so:\r\n\r\n```json5\r\n{\r\n  \"level\" : \"info\",\r\n  \"message\" : \"Coercion of boolean fields\",\r\n  \"messageId\": \"xpack.migration.deprecations.coercionBooleanFields.message\",  // added\r\n  \"url\" : \"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/breaking_60_indices_changes.html\",\r\n  \"details\" : \"more information, like which nodes, indices, or settings are to blame\"\r\n  \"detailsId\": \"xpack.migration.deprecations.coercionBooleanFields.details\"  // added\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nKibana can then use the identifiers to lookup localized versions of the string and use the provided English string as a fallback.\r\n\r\nIdeally whatever we do in this Deprecations API we can use as a pattern going forward, so I'd like to start a discussion about whether or not this is a pattern that seems adaptable to the rest of Elasticsearch or not.\r\n\r\ncc @cjcenizal @sebelga @talevy @azasypkin ","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
