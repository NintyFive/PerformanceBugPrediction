Perhaps we can build some intelligence into the update plugin script.  For example, in addition to verifying that the plugin version is compatible with the ES version (a given), perhaps we can have a way to tag a new plugin version with a \"breaking\" flag (for plugin updates that have its own breaking changes), and when the user attempts to update to this plugin, we can prompt them to acknowledge it (with a link to the breaking change documentation for the plugin) before allowing the actual update to run.  But this also means that we will need to start creating a breaking changes section in our documentation for each plugin, etc.. just a thought ...\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/160832997","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15000#issuecomment-160832997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15000","id":160832997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDgzMjk5Nw==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-01T02:59:21Z","updated_at":"2015-12-01T02:59:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ppf2 FYI we do have such doc in breaking changes.
