We are currently wire serializing these using custom code that varies between classes.  Since 6.7 there have been standard methods for doing this serialization: `StreamOutput.writeInstant()`, `StreamOutput.writeOptionalInstant()`, `StreamInput.readInstant()` and `StreamInput.readOptionalInstant()`.  We should use those instead.\r\n\r\nWhen the new methods are used BWC branches will need to be added so that we continue to use the custom serialization when talking to old versions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it will be possible to simplify some tests and equality operators that had to ignore nanosecond differences due to custom wire serialization dropping the sub-millisecond resolution from the instants.  (If we want to round to milliseconds for some use cases then it should be done by setters and constructors, not by wire serialization.)","closed_by":{"login":"benwtrent","id":4357155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTcxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4357155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent","html_url":"https://github.com/benwtrent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
