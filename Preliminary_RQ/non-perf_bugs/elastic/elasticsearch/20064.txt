This is quite useful because while the best practice is to address Elasticsearch indexes through aliases not everyone does that all the time. This will give folks who aren't using an alias an easy way to do it. Something like:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_aliases?pretty' -d '{\n    \"actions\" : [\n        { \"delete_index\" : { \"index\" : \"important_stuff\" } },\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"important_stuff_1471541773\", \"alias\" : \"important_stuff\" } }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nIt is super nice to do this in one action because:\n1. The cluster state update is atomic so if there is any failure adding the alias then the index isn't deleted.\n2. There is no time where a search for the index name comes back with no results. There would be, unfortunately, some time where the results can be a bit confused because index names aren't resolved to a permanent ID on the coordinating node. A procedure like this will minimize that time though.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
