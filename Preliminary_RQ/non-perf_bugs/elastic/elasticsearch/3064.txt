have objects with region_ids with mapping:\n\n```\n\"region_ids\" : {\n          \"type\" : \"integer\"\n        },\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n{\n'_id': 52,\n'region_ids': [3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 18, 30, 31, 30067]\n}\n```\n\nFacet Query:\n\n```\n{'facets': {'regions': {'terms': {'field': 'region_ids',\n    'regex': '62191|75|30',\n    'regex_flags': 'DOTALL',\n    'size': 10}}},\n 'fields': ['_id', '_parent', '_routing', '_source'],\n 'from': 0,\n 'query': {'match_all': {}},\n 'size': 10}\n```\n\nAnd it returns facet terms not filtered by regex:\n\n```\n{'regions': {'_type': 'terms',\n  'missing': 5,\n  'other': 570,\n  'terms': [{'count': 52, 'term': 30067},\n   {'count': 48, 'term': 4},\n   {'count': 44, 'term': 31},\n   {'count': 43, 'term': 29902},\n   {'count': 43, 'term':

with script and exlude, but not with regex, so I assume it's a bug.\nI try regexs:\n\n```\n62191|75|30\n^(62191|75|30)$\n75\n[75]*\n```\n\nIt just doesn't work.\n\nES newest build
