So that might be what is going on. Also, your tools may be actually sending documents. I really can't tell. You can tell what is going on by looking at the [hot threads](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-hot-threads.html) API but it will only tell you what Elasticsearch is doing, not why it is doing it.\r\n\r\nI suggest talking to the folks behind \"XenForo Enhanced Search + Similar Threads Plugin\" though. They are likely going to know what is up better than we will.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
