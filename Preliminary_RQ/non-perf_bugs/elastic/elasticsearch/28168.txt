The idea is to delete all items for a given day (e.g. today 10 Jan 2018):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"bool\": {\r\n      \"must\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"wildcard\": {\r\n            \"logfile\": \"general-app02-*\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"filter\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"range\": {\r\n            \"timestamp\": {\r\n              \"lte\": \"2018-01-10T00:00:00.0000000Z||+1d\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPretty darn sure this was working fine in ES 5.5 but now in 6.1.1 it's selecting documents from the previous day.
