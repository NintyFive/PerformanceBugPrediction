However, the following pattern that Lucene uses in multiple places:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nThrowable priorE = null;\r\ntry (ChecksumIndexInput input = dir.openChecksumInput(fileName, context)) {\r\n  // do some stuff that may throw any exceptions\r\n} catch (Throwable exception) {\r\n  priorE = exception;\r\n} finally {\r\n  CodecUtil.checkFooter(input, priorE);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncauses the `CorruptIndexException` to be suppressed if some other exception was thrown in the `try` block. So the thrown exception would not be seen as a corruption exception. This makes me want to check for suppressed exceptions as well in `ExceptionsHelper.unwrapCorruption` but I don't know enough about corruption detection to know whether that is safe to do?","closed_by":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
