But if an operation modifies the cluster state it should be executed on the master for consistency  reasons. I think we could identify all \"read only\" operations and change them to inherit from TransportClusterInfoAction instead of TransportMasterNodeOperationAction. What do you think?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
