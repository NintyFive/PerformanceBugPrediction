They are orders of magnitude slower than getting the analysis chain right for your use case. _and_ that the way that it currently works does a better job of explaining what is happening during search. And that is one of the goal of highlighting.\n\nSo, yeah, the supported way to do all this is to make the analyses spit out the terms you want to find and do match queries. For that read more about analysis. And if you need to do some kind of analysis that isn't built in then file an issue around that.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/159172560","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14943#issuecomment-159172560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14943","id":159172560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTE3MjU2MA==","user":{"login":"jkryanchou","id":1206342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDYzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1206342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkryanchou","html_url":"https://github.com/jkryanchou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkryanchou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkryanchou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkryanchou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkryanchou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkryanchou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkryanchou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkryanchou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkryanchou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkryanchou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-24T06:56:46Z","updated_at":"2015-11-24T06:56:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK, I was so appreciated for your help and suggestions : ).
