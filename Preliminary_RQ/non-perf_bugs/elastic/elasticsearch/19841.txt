part of our improved CORS handling (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/16092), we serialize the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response headers using Netty, which, if given a set of values, produces a response header that looks like:\n\n```\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With\n```\n\ninstead of a comma-separated list in a single header value \n`Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,X-Requested-With`\n\nSeparating each header value out individually _should_ be fine according to the RFC: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2, although the RFC does leave some ambiguity if such a separation does need to be supported.\n\nIt turns out Chrome is fine with this but IE is not.\n","closed_by":{"login":"abeyad","id":1631297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzEyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1631297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad","html_url":"https://github.com/abeyad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
