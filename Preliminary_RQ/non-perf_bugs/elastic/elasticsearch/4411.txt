What is the work around- can i explicitly set the templates path in the config file? Also should i be able to see anything in the logs telling me this the template files are being picked up or not?\n\nAlso while looking into this issue i was following the page to see if my templates are created ok : http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html to get an output of all the loaded up templates, And i've found it doesnt seem to work unless i specify the correct template exact name. So calling curl -XGET localhost:9200/_template/temp\\* or curl -XGET localhost:9200/_template/ doesnt seem to bring back any output at all.\n\nThis was using elasticsearch-0.90.3\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
