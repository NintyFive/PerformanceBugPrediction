When attempting to do a static import of `EsTestCase#inFipsSunJsseJvm()` in the two aforementioned classes in order to determine if we're running in Java 8 and in fips mode, the transport client used in the test fails to connect to the node. The `TransportClient` created, has a `TransportClientNodesService` that ends up having 0 listed nodes. \r\nThe failures are reproducible easily locally. Example failure: https://gradle-enterprise.elastic.co/s/yphikcuckyz5e\r\n\r\nThe workaround for now is to reimplement `inFipsSunJsseJvm()` in these two classes until we can figure out what causes the error.
