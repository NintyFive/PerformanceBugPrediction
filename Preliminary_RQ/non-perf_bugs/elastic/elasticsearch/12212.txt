Our systems are deployed with Chef and the chef-client runs about every thirty minutes.  The errors are happening after sitting for a few days.  Every time Chef runs it will copy the scripts from a repo to the scripts folder, changed or not.  ES will always recompile these scripts because the timestamp on the files has changed.  Eventually the PermGen will fill up and crash the system (even with no indexing or searching happening).\n\n```\n[2015-07-12 02:31:33,382][INFO ][script                   ] [S-10.129.22.15] compiling script file [/opt/local/etc/elasticsearch/scripts/dateFormat.groovy]\n[2015-07-12 02:31:33,385][INFO ][script                   ] [S-10.129.22.15] compiling script file [/opt/local/etc/elasticsearch/scripts/inbound_group_duration.groovy]\n[2015-07-12 02:31:33,388][INFO ][script                   ] [S-10.129.22.15] compiling script file [/opt/local/etc/elasticsearch/scripts/inbound_group_duration_doesNotEqualFilter.groovy]\n[2015-07-12 02:31:33,391][INFO ][script                   ] [S-10.129.22.15] compiling script file [/opt/local/etc/elasticsearch/scripts/inbound_group_duration_equalsFilter.groovy]\n[2015-07-12 02:31:33,394][INFO ][script                   ] [S-10.129.22.15] compiling script file [/opt/local/etc/elasticsearch/scripts/inbound_group_duration_greaterThanEqualFilter.groovy]\n[2015-07-12 02:31:35,718][INFO ][script                   ] [S-10.129.22.15] compiling script file [/opt/local/etc/elasticsearch/scripts/inbound_group_duration_greaterThanFilter.groovy]\n[2015-07-12 02:32:12,053][WARN ][script                   ] [S-10.129.22.15] failed to load/compile script [inbound_group_duration_greaterThanFilter]\norg.elasticsearch.script.groovy.GroovyScriptCompilationException: OutOfMemoryError[PermGen space]\n        at org.elasticsearch.script.groovy.GroovyScriptEngineService.compile(GroovyScriptEngineService.java:153)\n        at org.elasticsearch.script.ScriptService$ScriptChangesListener.onFileInit(ScriptService.java:588)\n        at org.elasticsearch.script.ScriptService$ScriptChangesListener.onFileChanged(ScriptService.java:621)\n        at org.elasticsearch.watcher.FileWatcher$FileObserver.onFileChanged(FileWatcher.java:271)\n        at org.elasticsearch.watcher.FileWatcher$FileObserver.checkAndNotify(FileWatcher.java:122)\n        at org.elasticsearch.watcher.FileWatcher$FileObserver.updateChildren(FileWatcher.java:207)\n        at org.elasticsearch.watcher.FileWatcher$FileObserver.checkAndNotify(FileWatcher.java:108)\n        at org.elasticsearch.watcher.FileWatcher.doCheckAndNotify(FileWatcher.java:62)\n        at org.elasticsearch.watcher.AbstractResourceWatcher.checkAndNotify(AbstractResourceWatcher.java:43)\n        at org.elasticsearch.watcher.ResourceWatcherService$ResourceMonitor.run(ResourceWatcherService.java:180)\n        at org.elasticsearch.threadpool.ThreadPool$LoggingRunnable.run(ThreadPool.java:490)\n        at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:471)\n        at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runAndReset(FutureTask.java:304)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.access$301(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:178)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.run(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:293)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n```\n\nThis is the GC that was performed just before the crash:\n\n```\n[2015-07-12 02:00:18,361][INFO ][monitor.jvm              ] [S-10.129.22.15] [gc][old][204306][1] duration [5.2s], collections [1]/[6s], total [5.2s]/[5.2s], memory [5.2gb]->[1.8g\nb]/[7.6gb], all_pools {[young] [2.5gb]->[20.2mb]/[2.5gb]}{[survivor] [2mb]->[0b]/[42.5mb]}{[old] [2.6gb]->[1.8gb]/[5.3gb]}\n```\n\nIf we stop copying the scripts with Chef then the issue doesn't happen.
