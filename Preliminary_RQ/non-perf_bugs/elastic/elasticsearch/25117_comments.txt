The `snap-repo.txt` file has tons of repositories that you have created.  Without a way to reproduce this, I don't know how you got yourself in this situation, other than you were creating a repository where you meant to create a snapshot.\r\n\r\nYour best bet is to stop your master node, restart it, then delete all the repositories you've created and start afresh.  \r\n\r\nLastly, if you can kindly post such questions to our discussion forum (https://discuss.elastic.co/), which we provide as a means to get help with issues running Elasticsearch.  We reserve github for known bug reports and feature requests.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
