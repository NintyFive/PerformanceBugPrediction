I understand your point about multiple indices, but that case seems even worse - if one index is unable to respond to the query, you might get results, just not all of them. Perhaps there could be an option to allow it if, for example, you are migrating to a new index with a different mapping.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/145862649","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13932#issuecomment-145862649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13932","id":145862649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTg2MjY0OQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-06T13:53:36Z","updated_at":"2015-10-06T13:53:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Duplicate of #12016\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/301619302","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13932#issuecomment-301619302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13932","id":301619302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTYxOTMwMg==","user":{"login":"helenzBV","id":25666415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjY2NDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25666415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenzBV","html_url":"https://github.com/helenzBV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenzBV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenzBV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenzBV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenzBV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenzBV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenzBV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenzBV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenzBV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenzBV/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-15T22:09:27Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T22:09:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tonyd Sorry to bother you but I just have a question regarding searching non-indexed field.
