This was thought initialy for queries but got also expanded to anywhere we have json. Unfortunately the name of the setting doesn't reflect what it does anymore, as it can be used in the context of snapshots, aggregations, scripts etc. Let's discuss whether we should rename this setting of have separate settings for each feature. What do people think about this?\n\nAlso, I think it would be nice to improve this feature by collecting different errors and printing them all out at the same time rather than throwing exception at the first problem found. Or maybe add the possibility to enable logging deprecation usages rather than throwing exception (both can still be supported).
