We should add this cipher to the list of supported ciphers in master and start testing with it.\n\nIn the past, there have been issues with this cipher being used for LDAP communication with Active Directory. We'll want to keep an eye out for this.\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"jkakavas","id":10281256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgxMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10281256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas","html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
