When at startup (unless security is explicitly disabled) we always add a default header `DefaultAuthenticationFailureHandler` to:\r\n`if (failureResponseHeaders == null || failureResponseHeaders.isEmpty()) {\r\n            this.defaultFailureResponseHeaders = Collections.singletonMap(\"WWW-Authenticate\",\r\n                       Collections.singletonList(\"Basic realm=\\\"\" + XPackField.SECURITY + \"\\\" charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\"\"));\r\n }`\r\nWe also add Realms dispite the current license and always add default ones.\r\nI tried upgrading both from Trial and Basic to Gold and everything works properly - authentication dialog pops up after upgrade.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
