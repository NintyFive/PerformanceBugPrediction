If i make no change to this setting via the API and it's not defined in the `.yaml` then trying to view this value using something like `curl -XGET \"http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty\"` just gives me \n\n```\n{\n  \"persistent\" : { },\n  \"transient\" : { }\n}\n```\n\nIs there anyway to show these default values pragmatically, instead of having to reference the documentation ? I wasn't able to find a way to query cluster settings, and return all current active settings. Not just those that have been user modified from their defaults, which i assume what `_cluster/settings` returns.\n\nIt would be nice if it also included settings that have been set via `elasticsearch.yml` and not just transient/persistent cluster settings changed via the API. \n\nThanks\nScott\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
