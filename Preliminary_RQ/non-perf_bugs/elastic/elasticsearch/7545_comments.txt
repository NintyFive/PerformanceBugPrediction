Trying to do a PUT or `_bulk` request against a closed index is throwing an IndexClosedException, eg:\n\n```\nPUT /_bulk\n{\"index\":{\"_index\":\"t\",\"_type\": \"t\"}}\n{\"foo\":\"bar\"}\n\nPOST /t/_close\n\nPUT /_bulk\n{\"index\":{\"_index\":\"t\",\"_type\": \"t\"}}\n{\"foo\":\"bar\"}\n```\n\nWhen I try this on 1.3.1 I get the IndexMissingException, so this looks like it has already been fixed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
