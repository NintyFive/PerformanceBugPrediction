This discrepancy has resulted in support cases where a user tries an unsupported setting and it fails.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Cloud-first workgroup, the ES reference needs a PR like [this one](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/65610/files) to add the ESS icon for supported settings, based on:\r\n- Cloud docs (ESS whitelisted) - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-add-user-settings.html\r\n- Code source of truth -https://github.com/elastic/cloud/tree/master/scala-services/adminconsole/src/main/resources/settings/elasticsearch\r\n\r\nOutput looks like https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/settings.html\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the Cloud docs are incomplete, meaning that settings are whitelisted but not documented anywhere. For example, these [security settings](https://github.com/elastic/cloud/blob/master/scala-services/adminconsole/src/main/resources/settings/elasticsearch/security.yml) are whitelisted in the Cloud docs, but are not shown as Cloud-compatible in the [ES Audit Security Settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/auditing-settings.html). Each of the supported settings should use the ESS icon.\r\n\r\nRelated to [#48412](https://github.com/elastic/cloud/issues/48412).
