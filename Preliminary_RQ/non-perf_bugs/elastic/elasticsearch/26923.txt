However for #25737 I am considering enforcing `required` both for path parts and parameters. This means I will run into more inconsistent definitions of the `required` for path parts.\r\n\r\nMy question here is: is my understanding of `required` in the rest-api-specs correct? If so, I would proceed and correct all inconsistent definitions of `required` I run into during the implementation of #25737.\r\n\r\n[1]*_script rest-api-specs:\r\n[delete_script](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/rest-api-spec/src/main/resources/rest-api-spec/api/delete_script.json)\r\n[get_script](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/rest-api-spec/src/main/resources/rest-api-spec/api/get_script.json)\r\n[put_script](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/rest-api-spec/src/main/resources/rest-api-spec/api/put_script.json)","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
