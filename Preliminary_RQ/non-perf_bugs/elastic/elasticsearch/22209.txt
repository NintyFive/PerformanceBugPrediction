Index simple parent-child mapping: \r\n`PUT /authors\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"author\" :{},\r\n    \"book\": {\r\n      \"_parent\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"author\" \r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}`\r\n 2. Get the type of the parent from mapping: \r\n`GET authors/book/_mapping/field/_parent`\r\nResponse in 2.x:\r\n`{\r\n   \"authors\": {\r\n      \"mappings\": {\r\n         \"book\": {\r\n            \"_parent\": {\r\n               \"full_name\": \"_parent\",\r\n               \"mapping\": {\r\n                  \"_parent\": {\r\n                     \"type\": \"author\"\r\n                  }\r\n               }\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}`\r\nResponse in 5.x:\r\n`{}`\r\n 3. Get all mappings for the type:\r\n`GET authors/book/_mapping`\r\nResponse (contains parent!): \r\n`{\r\n   \"authors\": {\r\n      \"mappings\": {\r\n         \"book\": {\r\n            \"_parent\": {\r\n               \"type\": \"author\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"_routing\": {\r\n               \"required\": true\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}`\r\nIsn't that strange that mapping for the type contains field \"parent\", but I can't get the mapping for this field directly? If this is not an issue, then how is it possible to get parent type in 5.x?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
