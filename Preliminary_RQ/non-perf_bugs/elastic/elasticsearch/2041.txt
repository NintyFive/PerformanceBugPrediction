It can be configured to only apply while merging, or on all output operations. The setting can eb set on the node level (in which case the throttling is done _across_ all shards allocated on the node), or index level, in which case it only applied to that index.\n\nThe node level settings are `indices.store.throttle.type` to set the type, with values of `none`, `merge` and `all` (defaults to `none`). And, also, `indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec` (defaults to `0`), which can be set to something like `1mb`.\n\nThe index level settings is `index.store.throttle.type` for the type, with values of `node`, `none`, `merge`, and `all`. Defaults to `node` which will use the \"shared\" throttling on the node level.
