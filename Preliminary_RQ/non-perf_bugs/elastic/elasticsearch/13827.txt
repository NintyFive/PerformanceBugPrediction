More precisely, we can read the following notes, respectively:\n\n> The _score is based on the query and represents how the query matched the **percolate query’s metadata, not** how the document (that is being percolated) matched the query.\n> [...]\n> Like `track_score` the score is based on the query and represents how the query matched to the percolate query’s metadata and **not** how the document being percolated matched to the query.\n\nI'm wondering why there is nothing in the API about the score of the document itself (being percolated) among the various percolator queries?\n\nI read somewhere that this would be due to hit score being relative to its resultset, and that in a percolator query, we only consider one document at a time, so the score on each percolator query is not really relevant.\n\nI was expecting #3506 to be the solution, but it's not related after having a look. Such a feature is also mentioned [here](http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Percolate-Query-Scoring-and-Fields-td4050649.html) in the mailing list but there is no technical answer.\n\nCan you confirm? Is there any way/plan to get a percolation score?\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
