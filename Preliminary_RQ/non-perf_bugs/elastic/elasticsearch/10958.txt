I keep getting 404 for all plugins. I do not have the most common setup, but it is not strange as well. I have my plugins in a separate folder and that does not seem to work. I use a script to startup a node:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\nNODE=idmc\n\nCURRENT_PROJECT=$(pwd)\nCONFIG=$CURRENT_PROJECT/config\nDATA=$CURRENT_PROJECT/data\nLOGS=$CURRENT_PROJECT/logs\nPLUGINS=$CURRENT_PROJECT/../../plugins/\n\nBASH_ES_OPTS=\"-Des.config=$CONFIG/elasticsearch.yml -Des.path.conf=$CONFIG -Des.path.data=$DATA -Des.path.logs=$LOGS -Des.path.plugins=$PLUGINS\"\n\nELASTICSEARCH=$HOME/javalibs/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.5.2\n\n$ELASTICSEARCH/bin/elasticsearch $BASH_ES_OPTS\n```\n\nIf I change the ELASTICSEARCH parameter to 1.5.1 it works. Any problem with the -Des.path.plugins and the security fix for 1.5.2?\n\nThanks Jettro\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
