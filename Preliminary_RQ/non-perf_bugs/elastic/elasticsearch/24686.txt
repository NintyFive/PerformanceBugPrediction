We (the cross-team ingest group) met last week to discuss improvements to naming, and filter-vs-processor came up. Our decision during this meeting was to rename things which modify data in-flight to be called, \"Processors\". \r\n\r\nThe net impact of this is Logstash will rename filter to be called, \"processor\".  \r\n\r\nThis also should mean Ingest Node renames to be called, \"Processor Node\"","closed_by":{"login":"jordansissel","id":131818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTgxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/131818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansissel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
