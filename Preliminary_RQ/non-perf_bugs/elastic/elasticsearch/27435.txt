e.g. an error parsing the query\r\n\r\nUntil now elasticsearch has  attempted to to return partial results under these circumstances and report the partial status in flags in the search response e.g. `timed_out:true`. \r\nSadly, today we expect most client applications will pay little attention to these flags and present partial results to clients with no indication that the results are incomplete.\r\n\r\nThis issue proposes we fix this by providing a new cluster level setting called `default_allow_partial_results` flag which is set to false and will throw an error to the client application in the event of any of the above 3 conditions. This can be overridden in individual search requests using a `allow_partial_results` flag.","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
