For example:\r\n\r\nA document:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"products\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": [\"cows milk\", \"milk\"]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": [\"green apples\", \"apples green\"]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I search `apple` I would like the suggestion to be `green apples` not `apples green`.  This would have been possible previously with the `output` field as the document could be described as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"products\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": {\"output\": \"milk\", \"input\": [\"cows milk\", \"milk\"]}\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": {\"output\": \"green apples\", \"input\": [\"green apples\", \"apples green\"]}\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the completion suggester would return what you would expect.\r\n\r\nIf there is another efficient way to achieve the same result I'd love to see it.","closed_by":{"login":"Tiedye","id":6187173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODcxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6187173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiedye","html_url":"https://github.com/Tiedye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiedye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiedye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiedye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiedye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiedye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiedye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiedye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiedye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiedye/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
