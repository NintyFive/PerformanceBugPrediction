This cache is most helpful when indices are large and calculating live-docs is relatively slow. The current defaults are so small that it sometimes cannot hold a single bitset for a large index and is effectively useless.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to switch the defaults to large-weight+short-ttl because that matches the use cases where the cache is most needed.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/555420045","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49260#issuecomment-555420045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49260","id":555420045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTQyMDA0NQ==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-19T09:43:17Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T09:43:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","performed_via_github_app":null}]
