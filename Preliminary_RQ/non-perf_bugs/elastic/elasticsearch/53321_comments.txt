For the underlying issue of doing it during a specific period, we already have an issue open for that: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37325\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue since we would prefer not to do the first example, and already have an issue open for the second one.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
