I first need to clarify a couple of things:\r\n\r\n * the index you show doesn't have any deleted documents so an call that expunges deletes won't help\r\n * the reason that there is more space used is that we kick of a [merge](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/shard/StoreRecovery.java#L136) after the shrink but don't wait for it to finish. We could but this would mean we need to block for a long time and we don't want that since this is during a recovery.\r\n * a call to force merge with `/_force_merge?only_expunge_deletes=true` is blocking and will cause a commit (flush in ES terms) after it's done.  The commit / flush is what will free up the merged segments since lucene won't select any segments to force merge (no deletes are present). \r\n * if a shard is idle we will force a commit (5 min no indexing) or we commit after a period of indexing. This will cause the old segments to go away. All we need is to wait for the flush to happen. \r\n* if the merge finishes after the shard is idle we will cause a [flush](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/engine/InternalEngine.java#L2046) once the last merge is done\r\n\r\ngiven that I think we can close this issue since we are already doing what's needed?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/381133333","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29482#issuecomment-381133333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29482","id":381133333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTEzMzMzMw==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-13T13:21:49Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T13:21:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@inqueue I added testcases for this unit and integration and they both pass.
