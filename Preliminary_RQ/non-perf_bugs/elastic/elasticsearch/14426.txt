The best I could find so far in the official docs was this link that explains how to [use scripts to make partial updates](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/partial-updates.html#_using_scripts_to_make_partial_updates). This approach has a few downsides:\n- You have to enable scripting, which sometimes isn't an option if you are relying on a (cheap) hosted solution (my case), since shared environments aren't reliable enough;\n- You have to learn Groovy, which is not so similar to, say, JS, when you are doing something that involves more than a ternary operator.\n\nOn the other hand, I think most web developers are so used to REST APIs that something like this would be common sense:\nPUT .../index_name/parent_type/123/nested_type/456\n- If both the parent object (with ID 123) and the nested object (with ID 456) exist, update the nested object with the request body;\n- If only the parent object (with ID 123) exists, insert the nested object (with ID 456) in the array with the other nested objects (in the parent document);\n- Otherwise, if the parent object doesn't exist, raise an error\n\nSo, what do you think of the idea? Has anyone else proposed something like that before? I would love to contribute myself, but unfortunately Java is not my thing... Do you accept PRs in Scala or Kotlin?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
