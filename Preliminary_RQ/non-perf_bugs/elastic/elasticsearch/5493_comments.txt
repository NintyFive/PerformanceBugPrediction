However I just looked into this and found that while our current version of JNA does not support a custom directoy, the latest version does (see https://github.com/twall/jna/blob/master/src/com/sun/jna/Native.java#L1014), so that might be a way forward.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of simply logging the failure since that does not provide an actual solution to the problem and will only confuse too many people even more (who will then ask about how to turn off noexec).\n\nIn the meantime you can try:\n- set the java.io.tempdir system property to a user-writable directory (maybe ES_HOME/tmp or somesuch)\n- sysctl vm.swappiness=0 _with a recent kernel_. If you want to know why this has the same effect and is in fact less harmful to the system than mlockall, see:\n  http://www.quora.com/Linux/Why-does-Linux-swap-out-pages-when-I-have-many-pages-cached-and-vm-swappiness-is-set-to-0-Shouldnt-cached-pages-get-resized-and-no-swapping-should-occur\n\nHope this helps for now.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/39124677","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5493#issuecomment-39124677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5493","id":39124677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTI0Njc3","user":{"login":"jimmyjones2","id":2991805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTE4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2991805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2","html_url":"https://github.com/jimmyjones2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-31T18:36:34Z","updated_at":"2014-03-31T18:36:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey, thanks for your response.
