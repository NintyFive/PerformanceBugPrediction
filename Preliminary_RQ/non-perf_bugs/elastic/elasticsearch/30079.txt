When using a terms query, it will be nice to provide an example ([here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/field-and-document-access-control.html#templating-role-query), i.e. directly in the DLS section of the x-pack security guide) of using search templates for substituting in an array of _user.roles so users will not have to go figure out how to do this using search template syntax (most users are not familiar with search templates so this will help make the getting started experience better for DLS), e.g.,  \r\n\r\n```\r\n        \"template\": {\r\n          \"inline\": \"\"\"{\"terms\": {\"group_names.keyword\": {{#toJson}}_user.roles{{/toJson}} }}\"\"\"\r\n        }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
