We should extend the syntax so users are able to specify a specific bucket in a multi-bucket aggregation. So, for example you could do the following:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"fruits\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"field\": \"fruit\",\n        \"order\": {\n          \"colours.yellow\": \"asc\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"colours\": {\n          \"terms\": {\n            \"field\": \"colour\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhich would order the `fruits` terms by the number of `yellow` documents for each `fruit`.\n\nWe would need to decide what we would do if `yellow` didn't appear in the top 10 terms for a particular fruit. Do we just say the sort value is `0`?\n\nBonus Points:\n\nWe could also support very basic operators on the multi-bucket aggregation's buckets so you could do something like:\n\n``` json\n\"order\": {\n    \"avg(colours)\": \"asc\"\n}\n```\n\nwhich would sort by the average (mean) document count value across all the colours for each fruit. and:\n\n``` json\n\"order\": {\n    \"avg(colours>total_sales)\": \"asc\"\n}\n```\n\nwhich would sort by the average (mean) value of `total_sales` across all the colours for each fruit.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
