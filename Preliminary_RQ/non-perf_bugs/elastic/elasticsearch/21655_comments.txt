A 20-node cluster is a large cluster, it would be a terrible thing to lose to misconfiguration\r\n\r\nFirst, losing data on standard OS setup should just not happen, that's just bad design. Working slowly or shutting down sure, but not data loss\r\n\r\nSecond, the right way is not to \"just up those variables and hope for best\" but to monitor current usage of system resources and alert on it. Change cluster state to yellow if it is close (say 80%), but not say \"you have to do this even if your working set is 100MB and you have cluster only for redundancy\"","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/332331362","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21655#issuecomment-332331362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21655","id":332331362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjMzMTM2Mg==","user":{"login":"worthwhileindustries","id":3536254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzYyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3536254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/worthwhileindustries","html_url":"https://github.com/worthwhileindustries","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worthwhileindustries/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worthwhileindustries/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worthwhileindustries/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worthwhileindustries/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worthwhileindustries/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worthwhileindustries/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worthwhileindustries/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worthwhileindustries/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/worthwhileindustries/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-26T20:49:45Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T20:51:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jasontedor this works to bypass the bootstrap checks\r\n\r\n```\r\n  elasticsearch:\r\n    container_name: elasticsearch\r\n#    build: ./elasticsearch\r\n    restart: always\r\n    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.6.1\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 9200:9200\r\n    environment:\r\n      - ENVIRONMENT\r\n      - discovery.type=single-node # when a node uses the discovery type single-node it can not form a cluster with another node and the bootstrap checks are disabled\r\n```\r\n@jasontedor this DOES NOT work to bypass the bootstrap checks\r\n```\r\n  elasticsearch:\r\n    container_name: elasticsearch\r\n    build: ./elasticsearch\r\n    restart: always\r\n#    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.6.1\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 9200:9200\r\n    environment:\r\n      - ENVIRONMENT\r\n      - discovery.type=single-node # when a node uses the discovery type single-node it can not form a cluster with another node and the bootstrap checks are disabled\r\n```\r\nAs soon as I try to add a build directory and use this Dockerfile to add on to it...
