The index has `auto_expand_replicas` set `0-all`. The second node drops, which leads to the first node automatically resetting the `number_of_replicas` to 0. This is a process that's triggered in a delayed fashion. `MetaDataUpdateSettingsService` listens on cluster state changed events and submits a cluster state update task to adjust `number_of_replicas` when it detects that the number of data nodes is smaller/greater than the number of currently-configured replicas. Assume this update successfully completes. When the second node rejoins, it sees a shard routing table that has all shards active (= primary only) and starts deleting it's local shard copy. Shortly thereafter (maybe a few milliseconds?) the first node updates the cluster state by auto-expanding the number of replicas back to one. The second node however has deleted the data and needs to resync the complete shard.","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
