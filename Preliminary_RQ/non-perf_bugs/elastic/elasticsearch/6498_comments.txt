Even though we change the `createrepo` call, we still call `gpg` with the wrong arguments. I would like to incorporate this fully into our built, so we need the possibility to configure this via `mvn` - I will ask the maven-rpm-plugin folks to support this feature, by allowing to configure the `%__gpg_sign_cmd` call.\n\nIn the meantime I will try to add this to the build by manually adding this to the `~/.rpmmacros`.\n\n@sergei-maertens @gioele Do you know, if there is any disadvantage in using the old signatures or the sha1 hashing in `crearerepo`? After all there might be a reason for the change? (sorry I am not a packaging guru) Especially, will all the newer RPM based distros work with the old repo?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/98724216","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6498#issuecomment-98724216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6498","id":98724216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4NzI0MjE2","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-04T14:15:59Z","updated_at":"2015-05-04T14:15:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So, from digging around a bit more there are two things.

That said this does not mean it's set in stone for eternity.\n\nA couple of workarounds are available if you are willing to create your own repo.\n- Built elasticsearch with `mvn rpm:rpm` and it to your own repo (you can check the `build_repositories.sh` script in the elasticsearch for some help\n- Grab the zip file and maybe create your own package using [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm), if you do not care to much about rpm standards\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
