If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nIn your post on the forum it would be helpful if you include details of the environment that you are deploying on, specifically the filesystem used. Among other details its useful to know if the filesystem is NFS.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that we do not maintain the fluentd-elasticsearch add-on for Kubernetes so you may want also want to ask for help form the Kubernetes community as you are using that add-on. You might be interested to know that we have [a repository containing Helm charts for deploying Elasticsearch and Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts) which is currently in alpha but you might want to have a look at too.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/)\r\nthat should be able to help investigate your issue. As such, I\r\nhope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
