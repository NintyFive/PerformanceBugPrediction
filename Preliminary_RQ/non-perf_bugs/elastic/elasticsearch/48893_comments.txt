It seems your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. If it turns out after discussion on the forum that this is a real bug I'd like to encourage you to reopen this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
