According to the [AWS SDK document](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3.html#getObject%28com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.GetObjectRequest%29), we should execute `object.close()` in order to liberate that connection. `S3Object` opens a connection for each object. That are not liberated even if the object is garbage collected.\n","closed_by":{"login":"xuzha","id":1799964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTk5NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1799964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzha","html_url":"https://github.com/xuzha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
