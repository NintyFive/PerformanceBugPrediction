First problem is that I get the popup dialog indicating that \"controller\" can't be run because it can't be virus checked because the developer cannot be identified. My company has configured my machine (with JAMF) so that I cannot choose the \"Allow any\" option to prevent Gatekeeper from prohibiting running apps that aren't properly signed.  (You can get around this issue by manually running \"./modules/x-pack/x-pack-ml/platform/darwin-x86_64/bin/controller &\", but that is not a good solution.\r\n\r\nThen, after getting past the first problem, I get errors like:\r\n\r\n[2019-11-27T14:37:24,736][WARN ][o.e.b.ElasticsearchUncaughtExceptionHandler] [] uncaught exception in thread [main]\r\norg.elasticsearch.bootstrap.StartupException: ElasticsearchException[Failed to create native process factories for Machine Learning]; nested: FileNotFoundException[/var/folders/ch/ffy34wnx2hs87hg6l_nq2m4jk1svrc/T/elasticsearch.enCagApJ/controller_log_16294 (No such file or directory)];\r\n...\r\nCaused by: org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchException: Failed to create native process factories for Machine Learning\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nCaused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /var/folders/ch/ffy34wnx2hs87hg6l_nq2m4jk1svrc/T/elasticsearch.enCagApJ/controller_log_16294 (No such file or directory)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1. start macOS Catalina\r\n 2. run bin/elasticsearch\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
