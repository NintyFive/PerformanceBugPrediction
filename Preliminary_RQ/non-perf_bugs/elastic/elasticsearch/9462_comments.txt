I corrected this issue in #8672 for `geo_shape` type but it relies on JTS (which is fine for `geo_shape` since the ShapeModule is optional).  Many users rely on `geo_point` type's `GeoPolygonFilter` which suffers from the same ambiguous polygon problem. This was reported in #5968.  PR #9339 corrects the issue but introduces this JTS dependency.  Will submit a new PR linked to this issue that eliminates the JTS dependency.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/76153602","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9462#issuecomment-76153602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9462","id":76153602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTUzNjAy","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-26T10:17:46Z","updated_at":"2015-02-26T10:17:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nknize I think this was solved right?
