This stems from the old habit of advertising the node client as the \"easiest\" way to connect to the cluster. Under the hood that node client was node really a client but rather a full blown node that had it's master and data setting set to false (with a syntactic sugar of `node.client: true`). Since it's a client embedded in other processes you don't want it to write stuff to disk and that's why the node env. logic disabled writing/reading. A side effect was that it indeed doesn't have fs stats (because it doesn't have a \"file system\"). As you can see this is all confusing and also a full node is not really the best way to connect to the cluster. This is why we moved to using the term coordinating node and removed the `node.client` setting.\r\n\r\nmaster/5.x have different logic which is way simpler to read and they don't have this behavior. \r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue. If you do have problems with 5.x/master please reopen. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
