More clearly demonstrated here:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT \"http://localhost:9200/test/product/1\" -d'\n{\n   \"desc\": \"one two three\"\n}'\n\ncurl -XPUT \"http://localhost:9200/test/customer/2\" -d'\n{\n   \"desc\": \"one two three\"\n}'\n```\n\nFirst bug: Setting the default field to `customer.field` does not limit the results to just docs of type `customer`.  No type filter is added, and both docs are returned:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST \"http://localhost:9200/test/_search\" -d'\n{\n   \"query\": {\n      \"query_string\": {\n         \"default_field\": \"customer.desc\",\n         \"query\": \"\\\"one three\\\"~5\"\n      }\n   }\n}'\n```\n\nResults:\n\n```\n  \"hits\": [\n     {\n        \"_index\": \"test\",\n        \"_type\": \"customer\",\n        \"_id\": \"2\",\n        \"_score\": 0.2169777,\n        \"_source\": {\n           \"desc\": \"one two three\"\n        }\n     },\n     {\n        \"_index\": \"test\",\n        \"_type\": \"product\",\n        \"_id\": \"1\",\n        \"_score\": 0.2169777,\n        \"_source\": {\n           \"desc\": \"one two three\"\n        }\n     }\n  ]\n```\n\nWhen `customer.desc` is specified using `fields`, the type filter is correctly applied:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST \"http://localhost:9200/test/_search\" -d'\n{\n   \"query\": {\n      \"query_string\": {\n         \"fields\": [\n            \"customer.desc\"\n         ],\n         \"query\": \"\\\"one two\\\"~5\"\n      }\n   }\n}'\n```\n\nThis returns:\n\n```\n  \"hits\": [\n     {\n        \"_index\": \"test\",\n        \"_type\": \"customer\",\n        \"_id\": \"2\",\n        \"_score\": 0.30685282,\n        \"_source\": {\n           \"desc\": \"one two three\"\n        }\n     }\n  ]\n```\n\nHowever, when the documents _requires_ `slop` on the phrase in order to match, nothing is returned:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST \"http://localhost:9200/test/_search\" -d'\n{\n   \"query\": {\n      \"query_string\": {\n         \"fields\": [\n            \"customer.desc\"\n         ],\n         \"query\": \"\\\"one three\\\"~5\"\n      }\n   }\n}'\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/30031785","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4356#issuecomment-30031785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4356","id":30031785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDMxNzg1","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-06T21:39:44Z","updated_at":"2013-12-06T21:39:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @clintongormley for reopening.
