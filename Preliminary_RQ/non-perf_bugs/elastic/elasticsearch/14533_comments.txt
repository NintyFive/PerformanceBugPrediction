This doesn't appear to have been resolved with an update from you, so in the event that anyone else is having this issue:\n\nI ran across this while I was learning about ELK and doing a few different variations of the installation. When I ran `yum remove elasticsearch` it left a lot of config files and directories around. \n\nTo fix this issue, before starting for the first time (after a `yum remove elasticsearch`), I manually removed `/var/lib/elasticsearch`, `/etc/elasticsearch`, and `/usr/share/elasticsearch`. After that I proceeded with my fresh installation.\n\nI **completely believe** that there are better ways to do all of this; but I was just learning and when removing and reinstalling ran into this problem...above is what fixed it for me. \n\nHope that helps.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
