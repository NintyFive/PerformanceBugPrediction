However this detection was broken in previous versions of Elasticsearch (from 7.0 to 7.5) due to a bug, so some indices in 7x may still declare a standard token version that when upgraded to a version with the fix (>=7.6.0) causes issues in the cluster (the index fails to open). I am opening this issue to discuss the possible solutions to fix this discrepancy automatically for users. One solution for instance could be to ignore all `standard` token filter if they are on an index created before the last fix.","closed_by":{"login":"romseygeek","id":1347065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDcwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1347065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek","html_url":"https://github.com/romseygeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
