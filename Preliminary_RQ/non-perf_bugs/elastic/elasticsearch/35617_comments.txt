It is missing all the information that's requested when opening an issue (e.g. ES version, ...) and there is no error message \"Primary shard activation failed\" emitted by our system. As this sounds more like a configuration problem than a bug, your question is better suited for the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for confirmed bug reports and feature requests. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
