However, as part of this, we also require Elasticsearch to be run in an interactive terminal, i.e., one that a human is controlling.  \n\nHow is this meant to work in practice?  Are we expecting users to log into every node in the cluster and type the same values in?  This doesn't seem to scale.  Many users have strict security requirements around not storing passwords on disk (i.e., PCI compliance) and need to make use of this feature in an automated fashion.  In some cases they have a app that can provide the password automatically, but we're not allowing them to utilise that easily.\n\nWhat's the reasoning around forcing the use of `${prompt.*}` only on interactive terminals?  If we want to enforce this, maybe we need to show an example in our docs on how to use this without human input?\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
