Create test index with one document:\r\n```\r\nPUT index\r\n\r\nPOST index/_doc\r\n{\r\n  \"field\": \"value\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 2. Run query with a rescore and see that the score returned for the hit is as expected (eg. _score=101)\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET index/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"match_all\": {}\r\n  },\r\n  \"rescore\": {\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n      \"rescore_query\": {\r\n        \"function_score\": {\r\n          \"weight\": 100\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 3. Run same query but with a scroll and that the score seems to indicate that the rescore was not applied (eg. _score=1) \r\n\r\n```\r\nGET index/_search?scroll=1m\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"match_all\": {}\r\n  },\r\n  \"rescore\": {\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n      \"rescore_query\": {\r\n        \"function_score\": {\r\n          \"weight\": 100\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis appears to affect all 6.* versions of Elasticsearch but is not present in 5.*\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"not-napoleon","id":979663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTY2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/979663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon","html_url":"https://github.com/not-napoleon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
