Point to the root of the source directory, select Import project from external model->Gradle, enable Use auto-import. In order to run tests directly from IDEA 2017.2 and above, it is required to disable the IDEA run launcher in order to avoid idea_rt.jar causing \"jar hell\". This can be achieved by adding the -Didea.no.launcher=true JVM option. Alternatively, idea.no.launcher=true can be set in the idea.properties file which can be accessed under Help > Edit Custom Properties (this will require a restart of IDEA). For IDEA 2017.3 and above, in addition to the JVM option, you will need to go to Run->Edit Configurations->...->Defaults->JUnit and verify that the Shorten command line setting is set to user-local default: none. You may also need to remove ant-javafx.jar from your classpath if that is reported as a source of jar hell.\r\n\r\nTo run an instance of elasticsearch from the source code run ./gradlew run\r\n\r\nThe Elasticsearch codebase makes heavy use of Java asserts and the test runner requires that assertions be enabled within the JVM. This can be accomplished by passing the flag -ea to the JVM on startup.\r\n\r\nFor IntelliJ, go to Run->Edit Configurations...->Defaults->JUnit->VM options and input -ea.\r\n\r\n我也按照上面的步骤执行了。\r\n\r\n我安装的 es 版本是 6.3.2(安装在/usr/local/下 )，源码版本也是从github拉的 6.3.2版本的源码，\r\n\r\njvm 运行的参数在 idea 配置的是：\r\n```\r\n-Des.path.home=\"/usr/local/elasticsearch-6.3.2\"\r\n-Des.path.conf=\"/usr/local/elasticsearch-6.3.2/config\"\r\n-Dlog4j2.disable.jmx=true\r\n-Didea.no.launcher=true\r\n```\r\n然后再启动那个 elasticsearch.class 的时候就出现了这个错误。\r\n```\r\n[2018-07-31T15:32:05,450][ERROR][o.e.b.ElasticsearchUncaughtExceptionHandler] [node-0] fatal error in thread [main], exiting\r\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/elasticsearch/plugins/ExtendedPluginsClassLoader\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.plugins.PluginsService.loadBundle(PluginsService.java:632) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.plugins.PluginsService.loadBundles(PluginsService.java:557) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.plugins.PluginsService.<init>(PluginsService.java:162) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.node.Node.<init>(Node.java:311) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.node.Node.<init>(Node.java:252) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Bootstrap$5.<init>(Bootstrap.java:213) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Bootstrap.setup(Bootstrap.java:213) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Bootstrap.init(Bootstrap.java:326) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Elasticsearch.init(Elasticsearch.java:136) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Elasticsearch.execute(Elasticsearch.java:127) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.cli.EnvironmentAwareCommand.execute(EnvironmentAwareCommand.java:86) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.cli.Command.mainWithoutErrorHandling(Command.java:124) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.cli.Command.main(Command.java:90) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Elasticsearch.main(Elasticsearch.java:93) ~[main/:?]\r\n        at org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Elasticsearch.main(Elasticsearch.java:86) ~[main/:?]\r\n    Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.elasticsearch.plugins.ExtendedPluginsClassLoader\r\n        at jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.loadClass(BuiltinClassLoader.java:582) ~[?:?]\r\n        at jdk.internal.loader.ClassLoaders$AppClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoaders.java:190) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:499) ~[?:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\n然后自己跟了一下源码，定位分析到位置如下图：\r\n\r\n![2351533024486_ pic_hd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10086212/43449716-b88d654c-94e3-11e8-9b94-75323a136748.jpg)\r\n\r\n这个 extendedPlugins 的  size = 0 导致的问题，但是我不知道怎么解决\r\n\r\n我之前也是按照上面说的步骤一步一步执行的。但还是出现这个问题，尴尬！","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/409238027","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30774#issuecomment-409238027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30774","id":409238027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTIzODAyNw==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-31T14:20:02Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T14:20:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a duplicate of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31555 .
