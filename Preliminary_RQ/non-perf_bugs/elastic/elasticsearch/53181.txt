Maybe we can find better ideas, but here is a proposal to get the discussion started:\r\n - Create a new `exact_match` query, which tries to match against the whole string. It fails for `text` fields and has the same behavior as `match` on `keyword`, numbers, ...\r\n - Create a new `text_keyword` field, which is essentially a wrapper around a `text` and a `keyword` field. Running aggregations or an `exact_match` query against this field use the sub `keyword` field while `match`, `query_string`, `multi_match` and `simple_query_string` queries use the `text` field.\r\n - Update default dynamic mappings to create this field for strings instead of the current `text` + sub `keyword` mapping.","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
