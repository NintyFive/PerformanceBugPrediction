I would argue that either quorum in this case set to 2, or it being set to 1 can be debatable..., since 2 in this case also means all. The reason we went with the default mentioned is because many times people run Elasticsearch using 1 node, or 2 (as a search platform for their database), on top of the just getting started aspect, and they are ok with potentially needing to reindex the data with the downsides that come with 1 or 2 nodes.\n\nIts similar in nature to deciding what should be the default number for minimum_master_nodes when running with 2 nodes. Any value you choose for it has implications, 1 means you might loose data and hit split brain, 2 means that once a single node is down, you can't do anything with the cluster (in our improve zen branch, we added the ability where they can opt to still being able to search on it, which will help the decision of which value to choose). For people running Elasticsearch with only 2 nodes, they need to decided and live with the implications that come with it.\n\nThe same applies to running Elasticsearch with 2 copies of the data (number of replicas set to 1). If people care more about their data, then they will configure it to run with 2 replicas (3 copies), and then the default quorum does the right thing. But many are ok with running with 2 copies of the data (for the scenario explained above), and not have to allocate more resources to sustain a cluster with 3 copies of the data. Its a matter of tradeoffs, and the number 2 just makes it tricky....\n\nMaybe the name quorum is misleading when it comes to 2 copies of the data, but to be honest, I haven't seen users being confused by our default behavior, and they understand what it means. So it doesn't seem beneficial to change the current behavior, especially when it can be easily configured (config or per API)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/47356465","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6482#issuecomment-47356465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6482","id":47356465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzU2NDY1","user":{"login":"Wilfred","id":70800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/70800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wilfred","html_url":"https://github.com/Wilfred","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wilfred/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wilfred/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wilfred/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wilfred/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wilfred/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wilfred/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wilfred/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wilfred/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wilfred/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-27T15:01:24Z","updated_at":"2014-06-27T15:01:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"FWIW, as a user, I was confused by this issue: https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head/issues/134\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/47357107","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6482#issuecomment-47357107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6482","id":47357107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzU3MTA3","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-27T15:03:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-27T15:03:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Wilfred I don't think that its the same type confusion, this one is more of \"why my cluster is yellow\" if I have one node, which is because ES defaults to 1 additional replica.

The other is being fault tolerant when loosing a node (and it's replicas). If we remove the exception of quorum for the two data copies case, (i.e., primary and replica) people won't be able to index when they loose a node, until the replica is re-constructed on another node - which may take a long time depending on shard size. To avoid this, one would need to keep 3 copies of everything by default. This is all about making the right tradeoffs between things and we feel that asking people to have 3 copies of their data (potentially many terabytes if not more) by default  goes too far. The alternative of having only one copy by default also doesn't seem appealing as it is a risky default. Of course, people can make another choice and change the setting - and we should document that clearly. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/249854283","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6482#issuecomment-249854283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6482","id":249854283,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTg1NDI4Mw==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T12:46:39Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T12:46:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It's been a year of discussion on this since the last comment, I don't think we are planning on changing the default number of replicas to 0, or changing the quorum value, so I'm going to close this, we can re-open if people still want to discuss it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/249858107","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6482#issuecomment-249858107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6482","id":249858107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTg1ODEwNw==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T13:03:17Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T13:03:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thx @dakrone for bubbling this up.
