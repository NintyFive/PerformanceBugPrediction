As a result, a lot of put_mapping tasks got generated.  This caused the cluster\r\nstate to be held on in memory and became non-GC-able until these mapping updates eventually got rejected (and the coordinating node ran out of memory).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7216393/48510849-e0488980-e809-11e8-9814-91d5638761e4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an enhancement request to handle this situation better.
