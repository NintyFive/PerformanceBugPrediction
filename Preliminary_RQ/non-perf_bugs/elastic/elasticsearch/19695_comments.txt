This is something we are working to improve over time but currently only the range query can be rewritten to remove `now` and that only happens if the field range and query range don't overlap (i.e. either they are disjointed or the field range is entirely within the query range). I have updated the documentation for the \"The cache is not enabled by default\" issue and slightly reworded the warning around queries using `now`.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/250093842","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19695#issuecomment-250093842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19695","id":250093842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDA5Mzg0Mg==","user":{"login":"peterskim12","id":1675548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU1NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1675548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterskim12","html_url":"https://github.com/peterskim12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterskim12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterskim12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterskim12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterskim12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterskim12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterskim12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterskim12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterskim12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterskim12/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T07:35:48Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T07:35:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @colings86! Do you think it's worth adding some more details regarding the enhancements around \"instant aggregations\" or does that make things confusing?
