However, when using just the first four characters as value for `preference=_prefer_nodes:...`, the preference does not get honored and search results from replicas on other nodes may get returned. The preference does only apply when one uses the full-length ID of a node.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Setup a cluster with at least two nodes. Create an index with a single shard and one replica\r\n 2. Index a single document\r\n 3. Do `curl $ELASTIC_HOST:9200/_cat/nodes?h=name,id` to obtain a short node ID and the host name\r\n 4. Query for the document with `\"explain\": true` to see the node in the response and set `preference=_prefer_nodes:$NODE_ID`, repeat to see eventually varying node IDs in the response\r\n 5. Do `curl $ELASTIC_HOST:9200/_nodes` to get the full-length node IDs (keys in `/nodes`)\r\n 6. Query for the document as above but with the preference using the full, repeat to always see the specified node ID in the response\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
