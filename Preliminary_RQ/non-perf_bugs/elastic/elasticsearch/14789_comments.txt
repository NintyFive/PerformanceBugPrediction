The cluster has (3) master nodes and (24) data nodes.  License and Marvel-agent plugins are installed on all nodes.  The marvel agent is using default config, exporting locally.\n\nSome more digging reveals that I may only be seeing these errors on the first master node.  I spot checked the other two masters and a random data node and they're clean.  This master node also fell out of the cluster overnight...  Possibly something else bad going on with this node.\n\nIt is also worth noting, I'm still getting \"no data\" from the marvel app in kibana4, and the other nodes are posting errors like:\n2015-11-17
