While I still think we need a generic way to do it, the cancellation process is very special case, it affects that way TaskManager works with tasks and probably deserves a dedicated property in TaskInfo. So, if nobody opposes, I am going to implement it the way @nik9000 has originally suggested. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
