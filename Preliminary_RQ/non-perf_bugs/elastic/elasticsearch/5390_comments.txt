If you try to index a document containing incomplete or other invalid geo_point fields in Elasticsearch 1.1.0 and you get exceptions like \"MapperParsingException[failed to parse]; nested: ElasticsearchParseException[field [lat] missing];\" or \"MapperParsingException[failed to parse]; nested: ElasticsearchParseException[geo_point expected];\", the solution is to skip the whole geo_point field.
