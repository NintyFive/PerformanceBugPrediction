The fix is in Lucene and will be part of the next bugfix release for 5.3: eg. 5.3.1:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-7698\r\nUnfortunately the bug is not on the validate API but rather on the query builder which creates an empty query when common grams is used. There is no workaround so only the upgrade to 5.3.1 when it's released should fix the issue.\r\n  ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
