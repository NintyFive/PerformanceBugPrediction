The reason for that is that we have it stored in a way that makes it easy to print it out as a json object for debug purposes, which is not the case when it comes to other properties like type, index, and many more.\n\nI personally wouldn't rely too much on the `toString` method if I were you and I would rather avoid to add every bit of information to it. You can always get back the `SearchRequest` object through the `request()` method and read all the properties that you need using the available methods (e.g. indices, types). Would that be reasonable for you?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/24837538","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1720#issuecomment-24837538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1720","id":24837538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODM3NTM4","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-20T20:01:55Z","updated_at":"2013-09-20T20:02:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing this one.
