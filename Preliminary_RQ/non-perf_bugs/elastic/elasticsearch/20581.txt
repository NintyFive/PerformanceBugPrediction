The idea is that we can run a query to get all urls in a path, e.g. example.com/path/here brings back everything under example.com/path/here.*. The following code worked fine in ES 1.7, but in ES 2.4 it doesn't. Lucene 5.5.2 always sets disable_coords:true when using a match query of type boolean, which makes ES stop applying the minimum_should_match parameter. The behaviour has changed in the Lucene 6.x branch, so I'm not sure if this is a bug in Lucene 5.5.2 that will get patched or if ES is doing something wrong. Apologies if I should be reporting this to the Lucene project instead. Any guidance will be appreciated.\n\n**Index settings and mappings**:\n\n```\n{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"index\": {\n      \"analysis\": {\n        \"char_filter\": {\n          \"drop_trailing_slash\": {\n            \"pattern\": \"/$\",\n            \"type\": \"pattern_replace\",\n            \"replacement\": \"\"\n          },\n          \"path\": {\n            \"type\": \"pattern_replace\",\n            \"pattern\": \"^(.*://)?([^/]*)((/[^?]*?)?(/([^/]*.html?)?)?)(\\?.*)?$\",\n            \"replacement\": \"$3\"\n          },\n          \"drop_leading_slash\": {\n            \"type\": \"pattern_replace\",\n            \"pattern\": \"^/\",\n            \"replacement\": \"\"\n          },\n        },\n        \"analyzer\": {\n          \"pathName\": {\n            \"filter\": \"lowercase\",\n            \"char_filter\": [\n              \"path\",\n              \"drop_leading_slash\",\n              \"drop_trailing_slash\"\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"custom\",\n            \"tokenizer\": \"pathName\"\n          },\n        },\n        \"tokenizer\": {\n          \"pathName\": {\n            \"type\": \"path_hierarchy\",\n            \"reverse\": \"false\",\n            \"delimiter\": \"/\"\n          },\n        }\n      },        \n    }\n  },\n  \"mappings\": {\n  \"page\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"sourceUrl\": {\n      \"index\": \"no\",\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"pathName\": {\n          \"analyzer\": \"pathName\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"raw\": {\n          \"index\": \"not_analyzed\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Query that fails by bringing back too many results**:\n\n```\n{\"query\": {\n    \"bool\" : {\n      \"filter\" : {\n        \"match\" : {\n          \"sourceUrl.pathName\" : {\n            \"query\" : \"http://www.animalfactguide.com/category/animal-news/page/6/\",\n            \"type\" : \"boolean\",\n            \"minimum_should_match\" : \"100%\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Query I'm forced to use to dodge the broken code path and get properly filtered results**:\n\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\" : {\n      \"filter\" : {\n        \"match\" : {\n          \"sourceUrl.pathName\" : {\n            \"query\" : \"http://www.animalfactguide.com/category/animal-news/page/\",\n            \"type\" : \"boolean\",\n            \"minimum_should_match\" : \"100%\",\n\"cutoff_frequency\": 0.99\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe code path that seems broken to me:\n\nLucene always setDisableCoords(true) here:\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/releases/lucene-solr/5.5.2/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/QueryBuilder.java#L284\n\nWhich stops ES 2.4 from applying minimum_should_match:\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v2.4.0/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/MatchQueryParser.java#L174\n\nThere's no other way to get past this other than setting a cutoff_frequency which sets a commonTermsCutoff = 0.5 and follows the createCommonTermsQuery code path here:\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v2.4.0/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/search/MatchQuery.java#L176\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
