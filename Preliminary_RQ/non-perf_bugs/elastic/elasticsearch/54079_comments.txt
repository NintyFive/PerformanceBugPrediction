I can imagine adding a validation where we would check upfront what the `actual` and `predicted` fields types are and deciding whether this evaluation request makes sense or not.\r\nAlso, we may think of matching in a smart manner. E.g.: matching a boolean field (that only has `true` or `false` values) with a numeric field (that only has `1` or `0` values).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
