We also agreed that it would be breaking and that we should wait for 8.0 to change the default behavior. However we can add ways for users to opt into this new behavior in 7.x.\r\n\r\nThere was no appetite to add a replacement for this feature (option 3) due to the fact that it doesn't feel very useful and that we have other solutions to provide good locality that feel superior such as adaptive replica selection and cross-cluster replication.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
