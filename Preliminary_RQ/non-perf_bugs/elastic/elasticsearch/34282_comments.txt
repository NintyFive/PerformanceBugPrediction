However in Elasticsearch we compute the threshold from the `totalTermFreq` and not the `docFreq` so this explains why the value can be greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This also means that we filter some terms that should not be filtered because we don't use the same metric (`docFreq` vs `totalTermFreq`). I think we should \"just\" switch to `docFreq` when computing the threshold.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/426994293","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34282#issuecomment-426994293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34282","id":426994293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjk5NDI5Mw==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-04T12:08:58Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T12:08:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think regardless of how we compute the threshold we should clamp it to Integer values so we don't trigger this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
