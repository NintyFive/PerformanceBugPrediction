Using the example of an ip whitelist (as shown in the docs)\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"ip_whitelist\" : \"192.168.0.1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nshould be equally as valid as\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"ip_whitelist\" : \"192.168.0.1/32\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThey both represent a range starting and ending on a single IPv4 address, and it makes sense to support both formats since a large portion of whitelists/blocklists support both IP and CIDR notation in one file.  Presently, an exception is thrown for the bare IP `\"Expected [ip/prefix] but was [192.168.0.1]\"`.","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
