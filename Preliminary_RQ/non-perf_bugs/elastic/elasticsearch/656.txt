They include:\n- `flush_threshold_ops.flush_threshold_ops`: After how many operations to flush. Defaults to `20000`.\n- `flush_threshold_ops.flush_threshold_size`: Once the translog hits this size, a flush will happen. Defaults to `500mb`.\n- `flush_threshold_ops.flush_threshold_period`: The period with no flush happening to force a flush. Defaults to `60m`.\n\nNote, in terms of backward compatibility, the parameter `index.translog.flush_threshold` is now replaced with `index.translog.flush_threshold_ops`. Though, it is still taken into account if set.\n\nThe default flush after ops size has changed from `5000` to `20000`.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
