The absence of primary keys is due to the fact that indexes can be combined rather efficiently, due to the fact that they are all ordered by doc ID. If you filter on two fields, two indices are going to be used unlike with RDBMS. While this is performant enough for search, I wouldn't want to rely on this for updates though, which may run at a much higher throughput than searches.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/378913582","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29383#issuecomment-378913582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29383","id":378913582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODkxMzU4Mg==","user":{"login":"ddorian","id":1592898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTI4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1592898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian","html_url":"https://github.com/ddorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-05T12:06:04Z","updated_at":"2018-04-05T12:06:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It could be optional so you could chose between update/search performance but I understand the reasoning.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
