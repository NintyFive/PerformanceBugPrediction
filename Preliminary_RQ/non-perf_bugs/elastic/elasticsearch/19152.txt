Because `-I` is not a GET operation, but a HEAD one, and it's not implemented.\n\nI think this is strange behaviour. According to [HTTP protocol spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.4):\n\n>  The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT\n>    return a message-body in the response. The metainformation contained\n>    in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical\n>    to the information sent in response to a GET request.\n\nSo would be nice to have the HEAD acting the same as GET here (without body response), instead of returning 404. I wasted some time trying to figure out what was wrong until i removed `-I` :confused: \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
