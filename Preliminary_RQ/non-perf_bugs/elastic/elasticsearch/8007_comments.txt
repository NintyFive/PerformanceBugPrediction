You're indexing a floating-point value for `@timestamp`, so Elasticsearch has automatically mapped it as a `double`.  The date `format` can only be applied to date fields.\n\nIf you change the mapping for `@timestamp` to type `date`, then it should all work as you expect.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/76173014","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8007#issuecomment-76173014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8007","id":76173014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTczMDE0","user":{"login":"drorata","id":2905978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDU5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2905978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata","html_url":"https://github.com/drorata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drorata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-26T12:53:16Z","updated_at":"2015-02-27T09:40:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a similar problem: My `timestamp` is in `_source` and the `_mapping` returns:\n\n```\n\"timestamp\": {\n              \"type\": \"long\"\n           } \n```\n\nIf I understand correctly, given this the `format` key cannot work.
