Not sure if this was a thought decision, or something that started of this way and just lingered since then.\n\nAnyway, for me would be awesome being able to control individually if I want routing_table or routing_nodes(or both). This is simply because depending on how many shards you have, the response starts to be pretty big(and being honest, the info given is also redundant, but grouped differently).\n\nI imagine for backwards compatibility, routing_table should cover both values... but would be possible having routing_nodes as an independent metric? Say, extending this Enum here https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/ClusterState.java#L263 to include routing_nodes and accepting both routing_table and routing_nodes on the check here https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/ClusterState.java#L468 ??\n\nIf this is something you guys would be willing to take, I'd also be more than willing to attempt a PR at this.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
