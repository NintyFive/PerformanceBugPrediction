When this is done with matching data you get 2 buckets, 1 for pre-dst one for post dst both with same formatted time (0300hrs).  It should consistently return 2 buckets or 1 bucket at crossover, which ever is correct.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\nDo a histo query with extended bounds on an index over a date range with no data over a daylight savings boundary.  Then do one with data and compare results around April 3rd 3am, 2016\n\ne.g.\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/read_5555605bab95c2765d65c3cc_201601/_search' -d '\n{\n   \"query\":{\n      \"filtered\":{\n         \"filter\":{\n            \"bool\":{\n               \"must\":[\n           {\n            \"term\": {\n                \"p\":\"doesntexist\"\n            }\n          }\n               ]\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   },\n   \"aggs\":{\n    \"events_by_date\":{\n       \"date_histogram\":{\n          \"field\":\"tsr\",\n          \"interval\":\"1h\",\n          \"time_zone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\",\n          \"min_doc_count\":0,\n          \"extended_bounds\":{\n             \"min\":\"2016-03-31T11:00:00.000Z\",\n             \"max\":\"2016-05-02T12:00:00.000Z\"\n          }\n       }\n    }\n    }\n}'\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
