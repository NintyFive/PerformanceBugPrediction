master we can just remove it, and for 1.2 I think we should \"translate\" it into the equivalent ConcurrentMergeScheduler (max_thread_count=1, max_merge_count=1).\n\nThis merge scheduler is not practical for real usage: it only allows one merge to run at a time, and it's scync'd so it blocks any other incoming threads.\n\nIt also doesn't work with the upcoming index throttling (https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/tree/enhancement/throttle_engine ), and while we could \"solve\" this by just documenting that apps shouldn't use SMS, I'd prefer to remove/remap it instead.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikemccand","id":796508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/796508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemccand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
