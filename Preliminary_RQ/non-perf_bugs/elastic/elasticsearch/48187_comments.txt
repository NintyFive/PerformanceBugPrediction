@nicolasSoares\r\n\r\nThanks for reaching out.\r\n\r\nCan you ensure you followed the first example in this section?\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/docs-update.html#update-api-example\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT test/_doc/1\r\n{\r\n    \"counter\" : 1,\r\n    \"tags\" : [\"red\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter that example, you can attempt the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST test/_update/1\r\n{\r\n    \"script\" : {\r\n        \"source\": \"ctx._source.tags.add(params.tag)\",\r\n        \"lang\": \"painless\",\r\n        \"params\" : {\r\n            \"tag\" : \"blue\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour error indicates the `tags` field doesn't already exist in the document. I'm going to go ahead and close this issue, but please feel free to re-open if more discussion or action is needed.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
