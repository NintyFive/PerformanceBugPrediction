Really it should be deprecated, its totally arbitrary depending on interface ordering. Azure should have its own pseudo names like ec2 and the others... How we resolve them is an impl detail of that plugin.\n\nMoreover i guess i missed where we again start binding to non local interfaces by default, but ill be damned if we leave it to luck with non loopback. If azure is not explicit like ec2 then we should add `_site_local_` or something safer. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/145930628","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13972#issuecomment-145930628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13972","id":145930628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTkzMDYyOA==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-06T17:11:28Z","updated_at":"2015-10-06T17:11:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yeah.
