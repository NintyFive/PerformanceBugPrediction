After looking a bit at the Unicode Text Segmentation specs you refered to I doubt that an implementation would be straight forward for general use cases. Instead I fear that any implementation will again be language and/or use-case specific, will require quite some additional configuration and in the end will also suffer from irritating edge cases that are difficult to understand for the user without understanding the details of the algorithm. I might be wrong on this, its just an initial gut feeling of mine having worked with text segmentation a bit in the past. \r\n\r\nI will label this issue for internal team discussion to get some further input on this.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/430651601","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34402#issuecomment-430651601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34402","id":430651601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDY1MTYwMQ==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-17T14:29:46Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T14:29:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry, didn't mean to close, reopening for team discussion.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/432616404","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34402#issuecomment-432616404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34402","id":432616404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjYxNjQwNA==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-24T11:19:54Z","updated_at":"2018-10-24T11:19:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @Tiuser4567, we discusse this in the team and agreed that while this use case is probably too specific to add a dedicated filter for it, it is understandable that solving this with `pattern_replace` might also be a little inconvenient. However, there are plans for a \"scriptable\" token filter (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26100) which will probably solve this kind of ask nicely, so you would be able to remove boundary characters on some custom logic provided as a script without having to use RegEx or write your own plugin. I added a short description of this issue and a link there, so I hope you don't mind if we close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
