This is why `) ` is missing in the highlight response.\r\nThe `fvh` has a different behavior and keeps all characters as long as they are in the `match_no_size` range. \r\nIn 5.3.0 we've added a new highlighter called `unified` that should in the near future replace the other alternatives. For the `no_match_size` option it behaves like the `fvh` and does not remove any character. I'd suggest to switch to this new highlighter or upgrade to a version where this highlighter is available.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/294803377","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24151#issuecomment-294803377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24151","id":294803377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDgwMzM3Nw==","user":{"login":"liuguangmin","id":3112623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTI2MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3112623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuguangmin","html_url":"https://github.com/liuguangmin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuguangmin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuguangmin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuguangmin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuguangmin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuguangmin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuguangmin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuguangmin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuguangmin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuguangmin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-18T11:49:50Z","updated_at":"2017-04-18T11:49:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"THx I have solve the problem ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/442742159","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24151#issuecomment-442742159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24151","id":442742159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0Mjc0MjE1OQ==","user":{"login":"eyesraining","id":21116448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTE2NDQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/21116448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyesraining","html_url":"https://github.com/eyesraining","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyesraining/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyesraining/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyesraining/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyesraining/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyesraining/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyesraining/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyesraining/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyesraining/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyesraining/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-29T08:07:02Z","updated_at":"2018-11-29T08:07:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"THx I have solve the problem","performed_via_github_app":null}]
