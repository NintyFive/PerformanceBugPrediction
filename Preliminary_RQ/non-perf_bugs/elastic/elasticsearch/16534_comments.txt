Github is used for bug reports and feature requests.\n\nI don't know why you think this has anything to do with \"greedy\". In doc 1, `aaa` and `bbb` are separate terms. The must not query you use finds the `bbb` term and excludes that document. It sounds like you are looking for something to say \"must not have only this term\". There is no direct support for that type of query that I know of. But you should also think about how useful this query is, since must nots do not contribute to scoring.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
