In fact we only recommend exposing the query_string query to expert users, not least of all because the syntax is confusing, fragile, and can produce very heavy queries.\n\nOur recommendation is that the application should parse the user's input and generate the appropriate query DSL, rather than just exposing all of the features of the query_string query.\n\nWith this in mind, field aliases are easy to incorporate into that process (eg using a `multi_match` query).  I don't think we should add support for them in our API.\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
