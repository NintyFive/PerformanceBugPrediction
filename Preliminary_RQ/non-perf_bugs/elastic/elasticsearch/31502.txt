For this reason, we cannot control the mapping types of each source, and cannot prevent mapping_exceptions from occurring. For each mapping_exception we're modifying the original document to avoid dataloss.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this is a difficult task, as elasticsearch does not report which mapping type is expected upon an exception - but only the field name that caused the exception within the indexed document; e.g.\r\n> failed to parse [field.with.mapping.exception]\r\n\r\nThere is one exception to this rule, which is when dealing with objects; e.g., when indexing a concrete value into a field with mapping_type of object:\r\n> object mapping for [object.field] tried to parse field [object.field] as object, but found a concrete value\r\n\r\nOr when indexing a nested object into a concrete value:\r\n>  Could not dynamically add mapping for field [boolfield.test]. Existing mapping for [boolfield] must be of type object but found [boolean].\r\n\r\nThe two exceptions above make it much easier to actually handle the exception and prevent dataloss. I'd like to suggest adding the expected mapping type for all mapping exceptions.","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
