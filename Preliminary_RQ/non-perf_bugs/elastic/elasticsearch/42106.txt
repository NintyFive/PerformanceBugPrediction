the feature**:\r\n\r\nWhen using multiple chained pipelines it would be helpful to provide access to the currently running pipeline's name, something like `_ingest.pipeline`.\r\n\r\nThis can be used in error messages or for building up a list of traversed pipelines without the need to hardcode the current name into the pipeline itself (which likely will be forgotten to update when the pipeline is renamed).","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
