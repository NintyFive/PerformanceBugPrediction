The rationale for this is that the datafeed will soon stop by itself.  However, there is a situation where this will not happen: when the node that the datafeed was running on is no longer in the cluster.  A datafeed can only stop \"normally\" by redirecting the request to the node on which it is running, so if this doesn't exist then it gets stuck in the `stopping` state.\r\n\r\nCertainly for `stopping` datafeeds that are unassigned or that have stale assignments, force-stop should remove the persistent task.\r\n\r\nPossibly the logic for force-stop could be changed so that persistent tasks are removed unconditionally for _all_ datafeeds listed in the request, regardless of current state.  But this requires a little more thought.","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
