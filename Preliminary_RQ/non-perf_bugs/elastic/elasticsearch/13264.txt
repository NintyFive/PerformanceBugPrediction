However NodeEnvironment is a totally different story. Can we fix the use of locking here?\n1. `deleteShardDirectorySafe` is anything but safe. it calls `deleteShardDirectoryUnderLock` which doesn't actually delete under a lock either!!!! It calls this bogus method: `acquireFSLockForPaths` which acquires _then releases_ locks. Why? Why? Why?\n2. `assertEnvIsLocked` is only called under assert. why? Look at `findAllIndices`, its about to do something really expensive, why can't the call to `ensureValid` be a real check?\n3. `assertEnvIsLocked` has a bunch of leniency, why in the hell would it return `true` when closed or when there are no locks at all, thats broken.\n\nAfter this stuff is fixed, any places here doing heavy operations (e.g. N filesystem operations) should seriously consider calling `ensureValid` on any locks that are supposed to be held. It means you do N+1 operations or whatever but man, if what we are doing is not important, then why are we using fs locks?\n","closed_by":{"login":"areek","id":753679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/753679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek","html_url":"https://github.com/areek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
