Solr is the only real implementation of Drupal's Search API (https://drupal.org/project/search_api) that has any common usage. The possibility to integrate elastic search as a Drupal module would be great one, and increasing the visibility among the Drupal community would be great for elastic search.\n\nYou can see at https://drupal.org/project/apachesolr that over 14,000 sites report using the Solr integration module. While only 13 sites report using an elasticsearch module (https://drupal.org/project/elasticsearch) and 26 use https://drupal.org/project/search_api_elasticsearch.\n\nWith the upcoming release of Drupal 8 later this year, it's a great opportunity for Elastic Search - Drupal integration. Because transitions between major Drupal versions are more like migrations than upgrades, it gives Drupal users an opportunity to evaluate their choices of technology between major releases. And if there's an elastic search module available around the time of Drupal 8's release, it will give Drupal users a (superior and) viable alternative to Solr that could really take off in the Drupal community for their search needs.\n\nThis issue is to request an 'official' elastic search module for Drupal or to see if there might be any interest in contribution to the above elastic search modules for Drupal 8. With only a few eyes on those modules, the Drupal 8 versions probably won't see much adoption. But if there's more people trying it out and using it and contributing to it, people will feel more comfortable adopting it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
