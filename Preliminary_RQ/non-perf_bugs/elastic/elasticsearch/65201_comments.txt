Moreover the `use_field` option expects that the two fields (the original and the alias one) have the same tokenization, they can have different filters like one that stems and the other that doesn't but any filter that creates different paths should be avoided. \r\nI hope you don't mind if I close this issue but we reserve github for verified bugs and feature requests. If you have have further questions, the [discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elastic-stack/elasticsearch/6) is better suited to start this kind of discussion.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
