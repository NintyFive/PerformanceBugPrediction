I am attempting to load just the rabbitmq river plugin.  It shows up in the logs like so, with no further logging in 0.19.1.\n\n```\n[2012-04-02 08:09:41,463][INFO ][plugins                  ] [Canasta] loaded [river-rabbitmq], sites []\n```\n\nPerhaps there is something silly that I am missing, but I swear that I got this river module running before.  I can't recall with certainty which rev of elasticsearch I successfully had it running under, but could have sworn it was 0.19.1.  In any case, if it is useful I've traced the code and found PluginsService.java [line 139], which appears to be what would prevent the module from being executed:\n\n```\nif (reference.moduleClass.isAssignableFrom(module.getClass())) {\n```\n\nBut it appears that this will never succeed, because...\n\n```\nreference.moduleClass  =>  class org.elasticsearch.river.RiversModule\nand...\nmodule.getClass()  =>  class org.elasticsearch.plugins.PluginsModule\n```\n\nThoughts?  Perhaps the above is appropriate and I'm just missing something in the config?\n","closed_by":{"login":"arimus","id":228394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/228394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arimus","html_url":"https://github.com/arimus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arimus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arimus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arimus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arimus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arimus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arimus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arimus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arimus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arimus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
