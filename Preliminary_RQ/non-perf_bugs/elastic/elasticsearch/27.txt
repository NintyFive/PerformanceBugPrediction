For instance, this works:\n\n```\ncurl -XGET 'http://127.0.0.2:9200/_all/_search'  -d '\n{ query: \n    {\n       \"filteredQuery\" : {\n          \"query\" : {\n             \"term\" : {\n                \"text\" : \"foo\"\n             }\n          },\n          \"filter\" : {\n             \"range\" : {\n                \"num\" : {\n                   \"from\" : 10,\n                   \"to\" : 20\n                }\n             }\n          }\n       }\n   }\n}\n'\n```\n\nBut this fails:\n    curl -XGET 'http://127.0.0.2:9200/_all/_search'  -d '\n    { query: \n        {\n           \"filteredQuery\" : {\n              \"filter\" : {\n                 \"range\" : {\n                    \"num\" : {\n                       \"to\" : 20,\n                       \"from\" : 10\n                    }\n                 }\n              },\n              \"query\" : {\n                 \"term\" : {\n                    \"text\" : \"foo\"\n                 }\n              }\n           }\n       }\n    }\n    '\n\nA JSON parser should consider these two structures to be identical, which is also the thing that rules out having non-unique property names.\n\nthanks\n\nClint\n\n(Edited to correct JSON)\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
