I tried to look at the code today and reproduce the issue reported and was not able.\n\nHere is what I did:\n- Launch a node with default settings and `cloud-aws` plugin.\n- Create a TransportClient like this:\n\n```\n        TransportClient client = new TransportClient.Builder()\n                .addPlugin(CloudAwsPlugin.class)\n                .build();\n        client.addTransportAddress(new InetSocketTransportAddress(new InetSocketAddress(\"127.0.0.1\", 9300)));\n\n        PutRepositoryResponse putRepositoryResponse = client.admin().cluster().preparePutRepository(\"test-repo\")\n                .setType(\"s3\").setSettings(Settings.EMPTY).get();\n```\n\nThis does not raise the issue reported.\nAlso in code we default `cloud.enabled` to `true`. So I can't understand how this happened.\n\nI think I should close it for now and may be reopen if the issue is confirmed by the user (on discuss).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
