But possibly not implemented.\n\nFor example, if I have a `user` type as parent, `event` type as children, and `user_activity` as another children type of `users`. What if I want to aggregate on the children_type `event` and nest another aggregation on `user_activity`? Having the children_type specified would help on this. \n\nBTW, is this kinda of sibling-nested aggregation supported in 1.4.2?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
