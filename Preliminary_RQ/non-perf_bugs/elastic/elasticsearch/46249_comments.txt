This appears to be a user question, and we'd like to direct these kinds of things to the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/). If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nIf you open a question on the Elasticsearch forum and link back here then I'm happy to assist you there. There are many reasons why this OOM occurs. So perhaps also include [cat nodes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/cat-nodes.html) and [cat indices](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/cat-indices.html) responses.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
