All you need to do is to create file config/templates/percolator_template.json with the following content:\n\n```\n{\n    \"percolator_template\" : {\n        \"template\" : \"_percolator\",\n        \"settings\" : {\n            \"index.mapper.dynamic\": true\n        }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it turns out that this file is not being read by Elastic Search. Trying to add the template manually results in the error \"InvalidIndexTemplateException[index_template [percolator_test] invalid, cause [template must not start with '_']]\".\n\nIt looks like this is [returned by the MetaDataCreateIndexService](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/0.90/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/metadata/MetaDataIndexTemplateService.java#L160). Is this correct? Is there a valid reason why templates cannot be created that refer to the percolator index? We've tried to 'hack around' the validation by using a regular expression but that didn't seem to work.\n\nIt's worth noting that https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/788 would also fix this problem for us, and in a nicer way.\n\nIt would be good to get some feedback on this as it means we have to manually intervene every time a new index is created that needs percolators.\n\n(Additionally, it's not clear from the documentation that the templates are only read when the index is originally created. If I get a chance I will put in a pull request against the docs.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
