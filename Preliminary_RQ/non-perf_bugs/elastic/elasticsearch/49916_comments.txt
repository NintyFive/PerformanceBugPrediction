This is possible today using [the HTTP config settings, particularly `http.host`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-http.html#_settings). Alternatively you might be interested in [Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes](https://www.elastic.co/products/elastic-cloud-kubernetes).\r\n\r\nI am closing this since I don't think there's any action to be taken here. If you need more help configuring Elasticsearch for your environment then the best place to ask is [the discussion forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
