It would be a nice feature to have some dynamic mapping of fields in ES. As now, the mapping is done before indexing and to change to Common Schema would require a mapping update and a reindex. The change on the cluster could be really hard and the mapping is quite easy to do wrong. So itÂ´s potentially a long road ahead.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that you make it able to put dynamic mapping to fields or translation of searches. Therefore you can in theory keep your old mapping and use the dynamic fields for dashboards and searches. This would also make it possible for changing dynamic mapping on the fly without a reindex.\r\n\r\nThe mapping is done with for example a translate table when a search is done in ES. Therefore you only change the translate/mapping table. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nlogstash-vendor1-20190130\r\n|Indexed field | Dynamic field|\r\n|srcip | source.ip |\r\n\r\nlogstash-vendor2-20190130\r\n|Indexed field | Dynamic field|\r\n|src | source.ip |\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fyodorr","id":38488235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDg4MjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/38488235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyodorr","html_url":"https://github.com/fyodorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyodorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyodorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyodorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyodorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyodorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyodorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyodorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyodorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyodorr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
