Also after a restart it is expected that any shard copies on the restarted node will no longer be primary since while the node is down another shard copy for the shard will be promoted to being the primary to maintain availability. \r\n\r\nPrimary shard copies do not experience more load than the replicas inn the shard group since all shard copies are sent all indexing operations and read operations are evenly-distributed amongst shard copies. The only difference is that the primary shard will receive the indexing operation first before it is forwarded on to the replicas in the shard group.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the above you can read the following sections of the Elasticsearch Definitive Guide book:\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/_how_primary_and_replica_shards_interact.html\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/distrib-write.html\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/distrib-read.html\r\n\r\n(The guides content is mostly written for thee 2.x versions but these principles are still relevant and largely the same in todays versions)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/374167695","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29133#issuecomment-374167695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29133","id":374167695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDE2NzY5NQ==","user":{"login":"ahmadazimi","id":1847191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDcxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1847191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadazimi","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmadazimi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadazimi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadazimi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadazimi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadazimi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadazimi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadazimi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadazimi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadazimi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmadazimi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T10:33:56Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T10:33:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@colings86 Thank you for your complete reply.
