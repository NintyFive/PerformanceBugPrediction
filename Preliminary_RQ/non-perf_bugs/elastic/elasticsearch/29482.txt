It would be an easy win to free up disk space by executing a force merge with `only_expunge_deletes=true` after completing the shrink operation. Could these options be considered?\r\n\r\n* Add a parameter to `_shrink` to trigger segment removal merged segments; i.e., call `/_force_merge?only_expunge_deletes=true`.\r\n* [Document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/indices-shrink-index.html) a clean up step to execute force merge with `only_expunge_deletes=true`.\r\n* Both options above.\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`):\r\n```\r\nVersion: 6.2.2, Build: 10b1edd/2018-02-16T19:01:30.685723Z, JVM: 1.8.0_51\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
