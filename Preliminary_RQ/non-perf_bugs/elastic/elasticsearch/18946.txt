to #18945 and to this https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/35d3bdab84fa05c71e8ae019aaf661759c8b1622#commitcomment-17914150\n\nIn GCS Repository plugin we defined a `service_account` setting which is defined as `Property.Filtered`.\n\n``` java\npublic static final Setting<String> SERVICE_ACCOUNT = simpleString(\"service_account\", Property.NodeScope, Property.Dynamic, Property.Filtered);\n```\n\nBut as this setting is not registered when the plugin starts, it's not shaded when you ask for `GET _snapshot/gcsrepo`.\n\nWe should either remove `Filtered` if it does not make any sense to filter it or register the setting or wait for a fix for #18945.\n\nIf we want to keep it, we can add a REST test like this one: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/plugins/repository-s3/src/test/resources/rest-api-spec/test/repository_s3/20_repository.yaml\n\n``` yaml\n# Integration tests for Repository GCS
