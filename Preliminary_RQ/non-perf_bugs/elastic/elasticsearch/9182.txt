of occurrences.\nFollowing the documentation, to get the top N terms, within a nested object (metrics in my case), my query should look like: (I loaded 100k document before hands)\n\n``` JSON\n{\n    \"size\": 0,\n    \"aggs\": {\n        \"metrics\": {\n            \"nested\": {\n                \"path\": \"metrics\"\n            },\n            \"aggs\": {\n                \"top_postTags\": {\n                    \"terms\": {\n                        \"field\": \"metrics.posTags\",\n                        \"order\": {\n                            \"_count\": \"desc\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExcept all I am getting is:\n\n``` JSON\n{\n    \"took\": 3,\n    \"timed_out\": false,\n    \"_shards\": {\n        \"total\": 12,\n        \"successful\": 12,\n        \"failed\": 0\n    },\n    \"hits\": {\n        \"total\": 100000,\n        \"max_score\": 0,\n        \"hits\": []\n    },\n    \"aggregations\": {\n        \"metrics\": {\n            \"doc_count\": 0,\n            \"top_postTags\": {\n                \"doc_count_error_upper_bound\": 0,\n                \"sum_other_doc_count\": 0,\n                \"buckets\": []\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd I have no idea what isn't working as it should, and any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you\n","closed_by":{"login":"amineferchichi","id":1105522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDU1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1105522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineferchichi","html_url":"https://github.com/amineferchichi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineferchichi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineferchichi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineferchichi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineferchichi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineferchichi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineferchichi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineferchichi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineferchichi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amineferchichi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
