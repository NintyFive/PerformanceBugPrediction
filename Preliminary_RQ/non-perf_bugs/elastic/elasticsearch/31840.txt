Yet, this might not work if the remote cluster is inside a cloud-env or behind a proxy. We can't use a seed node and then sniff / discover from there using the cluster state of the remote cluster. \r\n\r\nOne way to solve this would be a proxy mode for remote connections that doesn't sniff the remote cluster at all but uses N connections to a proxy using dummy discovery nodes internally. Configuration wise this could look like this:\r\n\r\n```YAML\r\nsearch:\r\n    remote:\r\n        cluster_one: \r\n            seeds: 127.0.0.1:9300\r\n            proxy_mode: true\r\n            num_connections: 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would translate to connecting to 10 dummy DiscoveryNodes using the same seed which can then round robin or whatever to connect to nodes. Each of these dummies would use a single channel profile. It's quite a different way of connecting but should work just fine for CCS/CCR purposes.\r\n\r\n/cc @tbrooks8 @bleskes \r\n\r\nRelates to #31835","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
