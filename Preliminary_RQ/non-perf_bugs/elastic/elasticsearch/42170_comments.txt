This is not to be taken as a guaranteed policy, only offer some insight into our current processes that you can take into consideration.\r\n\r\nWe qualify some bugs and issues as [\"blockers\"](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/labels/blocker) for releases, and for bugs labeled as \"blockers\" would hold a release until the bug is fixed. We do not and can not qualify every bug as a blocker, or we would never successfully ship; we will always have bugs. Whether a bug is qualified as a blocker depends on the nature of the bug (e.g., data loss issues) and the impact of the bug (e.g., bugs with no workaround that completely break a feature used by a majority of users). While this bug is bad for users of `cross_field` search and is clearly bad for you, it does not qualify as a blocking bug.\r\n\r\n> @jimczi claims \"It's too late for 7.1.0\". What does \"too late\" even mean? I commented in that issue but nobody has responded.\r\n\r\nIt means that we had finalized the release artifacts for 7.1.0 and the fix was not integrated in time to be included in those release artifacts, and instead the fix would be included in a later release. We do not rebuild release artifacts for non-blocking bugs.\r\n\r\nThat said, due to another blocking bug, we have internally re-built the final 7.1.0 artifacts and picked up additional bug fixes that had been committed in the meantime. That means the fix for the issue here will be included in 7.1.0.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
