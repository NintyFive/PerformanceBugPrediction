Patch looks good.\n\nIn any case the packaging manuals already say what I mentioned in my first post:\n\n> /var/run : Run-time variable data\n> \n> Purpose\n> \n> This directory contains system information data describing the system since it\n> was booted. Files under this directory must be cleared (removed or truncated as\n> appropriate) at the beginning of the boot process. Programs may have a\n> subdirectory of /var/run; this is encouraged for programs that use more than\n> one run-time file. [42] Process identifier (PID) files, which were originally\n> placed in /etc, must be placed in /var/run. The naming convention for PID files\n> is <program-name>.pid. For example, the crond PID file is named /var/run/\n> crond.pid.\n\nYour text was just a bit clipped. Basically it says: If there is only the PID file and nothing more of runtime data it should be placed directly in /var/run. Otherwise a subdirectory with the name of the program should be created (\"this is encouraged for programs that use more than one run-time file\").\n\nBut I am also fine with your pull request.
