I realize I am not fully informed on the history around these changes.\r\n\r\nWe removed support for specifying `-E path.conf` and `--path.conf` in favor of setting `CONF_DIR` as per https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/25943\r\n\r\nOn windows this leads to users having to specify the following on the command line:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n(SET \"CONF_DIR=x\") & bin\\elasticsearch\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe parenthesis are necessary to control trailing whitespace and the quotes to deal with spaces in the path. Whats worse is that that SET command is viral for the current session. Windows lacks something analogous to:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nenv CONF_DIR=x bin/elasticsearch\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo control the process's environment variables only. I would love to bring them back as command line switches since its such a common use case to specify these. (Which might be something we are actively discouraging?) \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
