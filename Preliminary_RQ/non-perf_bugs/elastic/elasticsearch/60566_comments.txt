I've recently seen a [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMi2g3uEAxU), where it gets mentioned how conscious new features are discussed here. I can only agree. And so i'm absolutely fine, if this issue gets closed because of that reason.\r\n\r\n>  users should not have to use templates to solve those issue\r\n\r\nGood point.\r\n\r\n>  can easily be worked around by lowercasing on the client side\r\n\r\nOf course. If i'm not missing something, the same would also apply for functions like `{{#url}}` or`{{#join}}`.\r\n\r\n> do you have any other compelling reason for needing a lowercase tag in mustache?\r\n\r\nI only came across the use case i've mentioned above. `{{toLowercase}}` could be used wherever parameters needs to be lower case. The caller, who sets the parameters, does not need to think about it. If the search template is used in multiple places, it would also be easier to do it once and not have to think about it wherever the call is done.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/693657024","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60566#issuecomment-693657024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60566","id":693657024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MzY1NzAyNA==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-16T20:48:30Z","updated_at":"2020-09-16T20:48:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We discussed this issue, and agreed with my original thinking, that opening Mustache up to more customizations is not something we want to do at this time. We will keep this in mind as future needs of mustache come up in new contexts, but for now the particular need about handling wildcard prefixes in templates should be worked around on the client side. As there are no further actions to take here, I hope you don't mind that I close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
