Specifically `composite`,  `min`, `max`, `date_histogram` and `auto_date_histogram` look at the points. We'd love to have some nice way for them to do it that tells folks when they implement a new type that this is something that they should think about.\r\n\r\n`min` and `max` look up the minimum or maximum value and cast it to a double. `date_histogram` and, soon, `auto_date_histogram` look up the minimum and maximum dates so they can deal with rounding more efficiently. `composite` iterates values is sorted order.","closed_by":{"login":"not-napoleon","id":979663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTY2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/979663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon","html_url":"https://github.com/not-napoleon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-napoleon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
