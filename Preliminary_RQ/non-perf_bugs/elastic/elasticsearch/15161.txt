From my perspective we should use an 8kb for writing most of the time which we now do by accident (we use `Streams#copy(InputStream in, OutputStream out)` which uses a 8k buffer. I wonder why we have these low level settings and if we:\n1. bring it back / make it adjustable at all\n2. drop more super low level settings in `RecoverySettings`\n\nthere are a couple of settings that are questinable:\n- `indices.recovery.compress` - lets either compress or not but why make this adjustable?\n- `indices.recovery.concurrent_streams` / `indices.recovery.concurrent_small_file_streams` why do we have this and why can't this come from some ThreadPool instead. I also wonder if the small / large differentiation is worth the trouble?\n- `index.shard.recovery.translog_size` / `index.shard.recovery.translog_ops` I think we can drop both and just hide sending behind a stream and just keep on writing to the stream and flush when necessary (8kb) or just use 8kb as a fixed size?\n\nI might be wrong with the 8kb since this is really an RPC rather than a stream but I wonder if we can find a good default we can just go with instead of having these expert settings. I would be ok with moving some of these settings to system properties to signal how expert they are but the amount of timeouts and things here is really not maintainable.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
