We did not have time to add all the features of Groovy (nor should we), and each one must be considered relative to the goals of the project.  Having a list shortcut will actually require all compound additions to have a check against def types since addition is expected to return a value where adding a value to a list would return void.  This causes a performance hit.  Compound assignment will still work against values in a list, though, which is a shortcut in of itself.\n\nAs for documentation, it needs to be improved significantly.  For the most part Painless is somewhere in between Groovy and Java, so if a Groovy feature doesn't work, it's safe to give the Java way a try.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
