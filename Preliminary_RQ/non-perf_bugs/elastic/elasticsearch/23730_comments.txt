That would be useful to figure out where the problem is, either in the interaction with the client or on the server side. May I ask you to move this to our [discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/) though as it seems more of a question than a bug? The github issues list is reserved for bug reports and feature requests only. Feel free to reopen if it turns out that this is a bug in elasticsearch.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
