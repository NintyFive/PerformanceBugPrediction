If some shards don't finish recovery before full restart, they remain unassigned after restart. Even worse, if there are shards of a closed index that were there when we started the restore process, these are used to recover.\n\nThe same also happens when a shard that is initializing due to index creation fails (e.g. due to shard store being read-only).\n\nTo reproduce for index creation case:\n- Set `cluster.routing.allocation.enable` to `none` as `transient` setting.\n- create new index.\n- restart cluster\n\nThe reason for this behavior is that the shard routing table, which contains creation context (created as new index or restore from snapshot), is not persisted with the index metadata.\n\nRelates to #14739\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
