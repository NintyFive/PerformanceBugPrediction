I know in a lot of cases it is close enough but it has bitten us enough that we just don't think it is worth it. I also found it super useful for testing and fought the fight and lost.\r\n\r\nI know that is super paternalistic. You are a professional and can decide for yourself if embedded nodes work for you. But since we've been burned by it we're not going to make changes to make it easier because they are extra effort to support a behavior we've been burned by in the past. It feels like the worst kind of waste of time.\r\n\r\nIf you have a working kluge then great. The nature of such kluges is that they are going to break one day without warning because we don't test them.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
