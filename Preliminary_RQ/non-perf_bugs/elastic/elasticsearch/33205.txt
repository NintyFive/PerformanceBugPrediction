This should be a rare occurrence but in a busy cluster this is problematic since any roles stored in a index will need to be reloaded, which means a search (or get if only one name is requested) needs to be executed and shares the same threadpool/queue as other searches. If the search is rejected, then we use our negative lookup cache to prevent this role from being queried for again. This leads to poor behavior for the user as users do not have the expected permissions.\r\n\r\nWe should look at how we can improve this behavior through the need to reduce which roles get reloaded from an index. This may mean a change in our caching or how we deal with changes to the roles.yml and reloading.","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
