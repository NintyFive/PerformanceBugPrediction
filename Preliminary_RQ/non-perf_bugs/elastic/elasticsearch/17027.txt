So i make \n\n```\nPUT http://localhost:9200/test10/_settings\n{\"index.routing.allocation.require.hdd_type\" : \"ssd\"}\n```\n\nand then do\n\n```\nPUT http://localhost:9200/*,-test10/_settings\n{\"index.routing.allocation.require.hdd_type\" : \"sata\"}\n```\n\nSo in elastic v1.7 all worked right for me - all indexes except one have sata allocation,\nBut elastic v2.x makes ALL indexes sata allocation.\n\nDocumentation has not been changed from v1.x.
