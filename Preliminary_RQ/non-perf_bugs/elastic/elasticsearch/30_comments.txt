All the parsers that I have seen, for example, do create a linked hash map to represent an object, which means order is maintained. Of course, I don't convert the JSON into \"nodes\" or maps, but use pull parsing instead, but I still take order into account.\n\nIn any case, I agree that the format you mentioned is more coherent. I will add support for that (and the old format as well :) ).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/139962","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30#issuecomment-139962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30","id":139962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTk2Mg==","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-02-20T00:48:32Z","updated_at":"2010-02-20T00:48:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Allow for the sort search element to speciy the sort fields in an array, closed by 1aa8e011846fae20d3333b73dcf463f9bc99538b.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/140007","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30#issuecomment-140007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30","id":140007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDAwNw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-02-20T01:49:57Z","updated_at":"2010-02-20T01:49:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To be honest, no I hadn't - but I've found this post which discusses the issue http://pmuellr.blogspot.com/2009/04/ordered-javascript-properties.html.\n\nIn Perl, hashes (the equivalent structure) are unordered, so I'm glad you're happy to add support for the array form :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/140254","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30#issuecomment-140254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30","id":140254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDI1NA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-02-20T15:35:32Z","updated_at":"2010-02-20T15:35:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Excellent - I can confirm that this is working\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
