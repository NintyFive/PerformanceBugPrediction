This presents a problem for Kibana users that utilize a tribe node, requiring them to first point kibana at a single cluster, then stop it and point it at the tribe node. \n\nIdeally the tribe node could be configured to route requests matching a given pattern to a particular cluster. It could be configured much the way we do the `tribe.blocks` section today, but say, `tribe.route`. This would/could also work for users that need to write to indices that exist on several clusters that a tribe node points to\n\nSomething like:\n\n```\ntribe:\n  routes:\n    indices.create: \n      .kibana: cluster1\n    indices.write:\n      myIndex-*: cluster2\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
