Maybe the change would be that on the node config, one configures the name+path tuples for folders that within them a custom FS repository can be added to? That way its well contained within paths that are pre configured on node level? If we do this, it will be a backward comp. breaking change, so we need to explain how to upgrade from previous versions to it.
