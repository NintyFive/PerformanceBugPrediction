The [documentation](http://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/) is good and it's easy to configure it on a project and to build a shadow jar (in addition to the normal Jar) that includes all compile dependencies. It adds a \"shadow\" configuration and a \"shadowJar\" task to the project and also allows to relocate packages by manipulating the bytecode of the classes (using asm) before writing them in the jar file.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to use [Transformers](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow/tree/master/src/main/groovy/com/github/jengelman/gradle/plugins/shadow/transformers) during the shadowing to do various things like removing duplicate license/notice files or merge SPI service files (that can help to shade Lucene dependencies). I still think that we'll have to write our own transformers just to not mess up the license files.\r\n\r\nIn multiprojects build, it is possible to use the 'shadow' configuration in a project that depends on the shadow jar with something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndependencies {\r\n  compile project(path: ':client:rest', configuration: 'shadow')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSadly I didn't manage to get it working correctly with the low level REST client and the high level REST client.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't really like the fact that classes are modified just before being packaged as a Jar while the tests are executed using the non shaded classes. Same thing for debugging code. Some dependencies might rely on hard package names to load a resource or a factory and I'd be more comfortable if our tests ran with already shaded classes so that we can catch such things more easily.\r\n\r\nI ended up writing some code to try to shade the dependencies using a custom plugin (see https://github.com/tlrx/elasticsearch/commit/b552340d11abaaf66f2cd8b98ce0a4b5f20adea5). It basically unzip the jar files of dependencies marked as 'shaded' and modify classes\r\nto relocate packages before the `compileJava` task is executed. This way project code can rely on already shaded classes, but it brings a lot of complexity to make it work\r\ncorrectly with IDEs and sub projects too. \r\n\r\nThat's where my little knowledge of gradle and our build brought me, I'd be happy if someone can have a quick look and give his thoughts?\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/311392484","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25208#issuecomment-311392484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25208","id":311392484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTM5MjQ4NA==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T15:21:05Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T15:21:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Also, I don't really like the fact that classes are modified just before being packaged as a Jar while the tests are executed using the non shaded classes.\r\n\r\nI would not do this, for that exact reason.
