We should still enable the cache for these jobs, even if it doesn't cache _tests_.\r\n\r\nWe'd have to look into how this would all work as well. I suspect we aren't tracking the distribution as an input (since we just pass its _location_ as a system property), and the bats tests are a whole other animal.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
