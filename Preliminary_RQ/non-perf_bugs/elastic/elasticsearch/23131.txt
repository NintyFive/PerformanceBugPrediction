I believe its equal to the sum of _time spent in search queue (if any) + time taken in query phase + time taken in fetch phase_ considering the search type is **query_then_fetch**.\r\n\r\nHowever, **msearch** API doesn't expose any feature like \"took\" to find out total time taken by the multi-search query. How do we know how much time multi-search query took. Is it equal to the sum of \"took\" value of all the individual queries (which, I believe, shouldn't be the case as queries run in parallel) or maximum of all the individual query's \"took\" value or something else? If answer is something else then wouldn't it be helpful to add \"took\" field for msearch API as well.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
