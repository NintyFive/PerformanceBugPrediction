Rest status code should be `503`.\n## Original Request:\n\nWhen a node in a cluster reboots, there is a brief period of time while that node is searching for a master that that node can 404, even if `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` equals 2:\n\n```\n% sudo service elasticsearch restart\n...\ntime passes\n...\n% curl http://localhost:9200/index/type/id\n{\"error\":\"IndexMissingException[[index] missing]\",\"status\":404}\n% curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health\n{\"error\" : \"MasterNotDiscoveredException[]\", \"status\" : 500}\n```\n\nSince this is the same error message you get when the there's actually no index, I need to check with /_cluster/health to see if the cluster is in this startup phase to tell if this is a temporary error or not. It'd be preferable if instead elasticsearch could just raise a separate error so I don't need to do that.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
