If it runs out of disk space part way through, the OS rejects the `write` call, and we'll hit a \"tragic\" exception that will fail that shard.\n\nThis behavior is particularly evil because on filling up the disk, the merge will then go and remove all temp files, thus freeing up (sizable) disk space and provoking issues like #15420 where \"at first it failed and now it succeeded\" leads to corruption.\n\nInstead, we should avoid kicking off the merge, up front, if there isn't enough space?  I think we need some simple \"reservation\" API where the merge can claim how much space it expects to use, and fail at that point if there isn't enough space.\n\nProbably we could do this with a `Directory` wrapper that 1) uses Java's APIs to monitor free space periodically, and 2) adds this new reservation API.  This wrapper should then throw the \"disk full\" `IOException` long before the underlying disk actually fills up.  We would need to wrap `IndexOutput` as well, because the up front estimate could be off, and of course other things (merges from other shards, users copying files around, etc.) can concurrently fill up the disk.\n\nI think much of this improvement could be done in Lucene, with ES customizing the \"reserve\" method to be aware of N shards that are all reserving space for their merges on one node?  Lucene's default `TieredMergePolicy` already estimates the size of the merged segment to enforce its `maxMergedSegmentMB`...\n\nOr maybe there's a simpler approach?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
