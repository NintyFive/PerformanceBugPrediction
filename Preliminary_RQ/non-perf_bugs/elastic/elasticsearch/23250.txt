Normally, that's very, very fast.  But occasionally an egregious search/dataset can take a while to get through, so we added the ability to [kill them through the task manager](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/20405).  That's great, but it's difficult to use from the UI that executes the search.\r\n\r\nConsider:\r\n1. User enters a search that will be slow into an external UI\r\n2. UI executes search to Elasticsearch\r\n3. User wants to cancel before results come back\r\n\r\nHow does the UI match up the search that was executed with the list of tasks that are in the system?  The UI could try some heuristics to match up [the search descriptions in the task manager](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/21740) to the original request, but it'd have to be done based upon heuristics and those heuristics become very difficult given Elasticsearch will have rewritten the query and that there could be multiple searches that match the heuristic.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if you could associate some ID with a request at search time and have that ID show up in the task manager.  That way, when the UI executes the request, it could specify an ID it could reference later if it needs to kill the request.","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
