The delete does two things before it runs the actual delete:\r\n\r\n* Check the repository data for the snapshot name that is to be deleted\r\n* If that fails, check the cluster state if there is a snapshot by the given name in progress\r\n\r\nIf the snapshot is in progress during the first check but finishes before the second check, we get a `404` because we fail to see the snapshot as existing or in-progress. There is no way of really fixing this in `6.x` (fix in `7.x` + `master` is incoming as part of the concurrent repo operations work though). I'll find a way to make the test resilient to this for now.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
