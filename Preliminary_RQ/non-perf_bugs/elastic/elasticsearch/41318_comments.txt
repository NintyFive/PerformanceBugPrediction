There were a few backups of `log4j2.properties` in the config directory which may have been in conflict. I spotted on another node in the same cluster where an `/etc/elasticsearch/x-pack/log4j2.properties` was left behind causing audit logging to land in `<cluster_name>_access.log`. Again, audit logging works as expected after cleaning it up.\r\n\r\nThanks for checking on it @albertzaharovits. Closing this until I find something specific related to upgrade.
