One solution is a key-value file with root only access, or a here file (<<eof) in the auto-startup script with root only access. Another is to encrypt the whole elasticsearch.yml file and on start up, a single password is used to decrypt in memory. The password can be passed by stdin. \n\nIn my situation, bare passwords are not allowed to be in the nodes for security reasons. So we always start the services remotely from command and control hosts and with control programs, not manually. Also, if we have to restart a node, we rather it didn't automatically. We want to know why it failed first. \n\nThanks\nPeter\n\n> On Apr 28, 2015, at 10:19 AM, Jay Modi notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> This is something we've discussed and looked into, but ran into issues with multiple passwords prompts I believe (/cc @spinscale).
