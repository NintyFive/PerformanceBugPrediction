Currently ES-SQL implements the GROUP BY YEAR(timestamp) as a histogram of milliseconds in a year (365 x 24 x 60 x 60 x 1000).\r\nSo the YEAR(timestamp) has a different behavior if it's in the SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY and HAVING than when it's a GROUP BY column.\r\n\r\nI will close this as a duplicate of #40162. Thanks for taking reporting it.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
