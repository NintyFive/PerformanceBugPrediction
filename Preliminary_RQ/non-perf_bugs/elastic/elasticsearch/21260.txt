Ideally this should fail early, probably as early as finished parsing detailing which parameter was missing. At the very least the error encountered should be a little more descriptive than a mere null pointer exception.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, also note that this request has two parameters (template and params) that shouldn't be there for a non-template request. We should barf when seeing stuff like this as well.","closed_by":{"login":"MaineC","id":70953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/70953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC","html_url":"https://github.com/MaineC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
