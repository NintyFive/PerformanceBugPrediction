I was experiencing also some problems with position_offset_gap when applying analyzers. Field is multivalue and position_offset_gap works properly if I don't define any analyzer for this field. However when applying an analyzer such us asciifolding it seems that position_offset_gap is not applied.\n\nIs this the expected behaviour? I tried to handle it creating a custom analyzer with position_offset_gap but didn't work\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/10934/files#r29594225\n\nThank you\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/105204463","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9862#issuecomment-105204463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9862","id":105204463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTIwNDQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-25T10:48:00Z","updated_at":"2015-05-25T10:48:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @VicsCaba - not fixed yet, still on the list.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/162230670","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9862#issuecomment-162230670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9862","id":162230670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjIzMDY3MA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-05T17:52:14Z","updated_at":"2015-12-05T17:52:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This appears to have been fixed, at least in 2.1.0\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
