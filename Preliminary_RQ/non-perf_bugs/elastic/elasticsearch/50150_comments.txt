I think IntervalsSourceProvider.Prefix is one of the easiest of the implementations. I think a test for this should try to extend AbstractSerializingTestCase that already takes away some boilerplate code for creating random instances and test that both our xContent serialization (what typically is passed as JSON through the REST layer) and the internal serialization works. You can take a look at e.g. at `TaskInfoTests` for inspiration how some of these tests look like and work from there. Hope that helps.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
