Currently i am facing the problem in which all the shards are diverted to one of the two data nodes (checked via monitoring through kibana). When I intentionally shut down that node, I am getting the error that all primary shards are lost. But when, I shut down the other node (that too intentionally) cluster is running ok. I am running all three nodes on different machines, shared with each other. So,\r\n1. Instead of two data nodes should I make two coordinating nodes ?? (As far as I know every node is a coordinating node)\r\n2. I want, if my one load balancing node breaks down the other node should handle it's work. For that what should i do ??","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
