I have the following (simplified) schema:\n\n``` json\n{\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"rates\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\"\n            },\n\n            \"details\": {\n                \"type\": \"nested\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"amount\": {\n                        \"type\": \"integer\"\n                    },\n                                        \"type\": {\n                                               \"type\": \"string\"\n                                       }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nrates is an object that contains various exchange rates for different currencies. The details property is nested because I need to do sums on the amount and filter by type.\n\nWhat I want is, for each amount in the nested property, being able to write a script (in Groovy, Expression...) where the amount is multiplied by a rate:\n\n``` json\n{\n            \"aggs\": {\n                \"details\": {\n                    \"nested\": {\n                        \"path\": \"details\"\n                    },\n\n                    \"aggs\": {\n                        \"filter\": {\n                            \"term\": {\"type\": \"a\"}\n                        },\n\n                        \"aggs\": {\n                            \"sum_amount\": {\n                                \"sum\": {\n                                    \"script\": \"doc['details.amount'].value * doc['rates.usd'].value\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }    \n        }\n```\n\nThis does not work however, because I cannot fetch the rates property (and returns 0). If I do a reverse nested, then I can (logically) access again the rates, the I loose access to the amount.\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
