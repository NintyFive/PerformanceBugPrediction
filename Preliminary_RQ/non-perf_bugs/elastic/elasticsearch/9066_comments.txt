The latch you refer to waits on the execution of recovery_mapping_check on the _local_ node. The bug you mentioned concerns (if I understand correctly) refreshing the mapping on the master. Can you confirm it kept causing cluster state publishing? \nI think a timeout in the recovery_mapping_check  makes sense - waiting for the confirmation to see it will actually solve the issue.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/91777965","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9066#issuecomment-91777965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9066","id":91777965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxNzc3OTY1","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-11T06:58:09Z","updated_at":"2015-04-11T06:58:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"this was resolved with #9575, forgot to close at the time.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
