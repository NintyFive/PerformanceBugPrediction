The stop word lists for all supported languages are defined in Lucene or another libraries (snowball). However since we don't have an analyzer for the Mongolian language I wonder how we could expose this. Are you using another resources to analyze Mongolian in Elasticsearch ? A Mongolian stemmer for instance would add great value and would be a good reason to add a Mongolian analyzer in Lucene but I am not aware of any.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/476561647","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40434#issuecomment-476561647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40434","id":476561647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjU2MTY0Nw==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-26T10:24:09Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T10:24:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-search","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/479575206","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40434#issuecomment-479575206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40434","id":479575206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTU3NTIwNg==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T17:03:11Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T17:03:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@hurelhuyag I am going to close this issue because I think that such resource should be added to Lucene first.
