No 'run_as' used, just regular basic auth using 'native' impersonator user (10 concurrent threads):\r\n`ab -c 10 -n 2000 -A impersonator:somepass http://localhost:9200/`\r\n\r\nAll good:\r\n\r\n```\r\nComplete requests:      2000\r\nFailed requests:        0   \r\nWrite errors:           0   \r\n```\r\n\r\n2. 'Run_as' used, trying to impersonate 'builtin' elastic user (10 threads too):\r\n`ab -c 10 -n 2000 -H 'es-security-runas-user: elastic' -A impersonator:somepass http://localhost:9200/`\r\n\r\nStill good:\r\n\r\n```\r\nComplete requests:      2000\r\nFailed requests:        0   \r\nWrite errors:           0   \r\n```\r\n\r\n3. 'Run_as' used, trying to impersonate 'non-builtin' user (10 threads too):\r\n\r\n`ab -c 10 -n 2000 -H 'es-security-runas-user: somenativeuser' -A impersonator:somepass http://localhost:9200/`\r\n\r\n```\r\nComplete requests:      2000\r\nFailed requests:        137 \r\nWrite errors:           0   \r\nNon-2xx responses:      137 \r\n```\r\n\r\nSome of the responses fail with 401 in such case. This happens for **both users from native and ldap realms.**\r\n\r\n**HOWEVER:**\r\n\r\n4.  'Run_as' used, trying to impersonate 'non-builtin' user (**single thread only**):\r\n\r\n`ab -c 1 -n 2000 -H 'es-security-runas-user: somenativeuser' -A impersonator:somepass \r\n\r\n```\r\nComplete requests:      2000\r\nFailed requests:        0\r\nWrite errors:           0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo single thread test runs OK.\r\n\r\nIt looks like something bad happens when **run_as** feature has to do parallel lookups on the (not builtin) user  - the process does not scale to multiple threads very well.
