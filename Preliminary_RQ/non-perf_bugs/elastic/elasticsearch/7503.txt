In my case I'm not interested in the hits, so I would like to set the size to `0` for the search. I do it like this - query stays the same:\n\n``` java\n        SearchResponse searchRes = esClient.prepareSearch(indexes)\n            .setTypes(types)\n            .setSource(query.getBytes())\n                /* Set the size to 0 so that we don't have hits */\n                .setSize(0)\n            .execute()\n            .actionGet();\n```\n\n  At this point I get this as result:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  \"took\" : 0,\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\n  \"_shards\" : {\n    \"total\" : 5,\n    \"successful\" : 5,\n    \"failed\" : 0\n  },\n  \"hits\" : {\n    \"total\" : 348,\n    \"max_score\" : 0.0,\n    \"hits\" : [ ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n  As you can see the facets have disappeared. I can set the size to anything - for example:\n\n``` java\n        SearchResponse searchRes = esClient.prepareSearch(indexes)\n            .setTypes(types)\n            .setSource(query.getBytes())\n                /* Set the size to 1, to make a point */\n                .setSize(1)\n            .execute()\n            .actionGet();\n```\n\n  And my response will look something like this:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  \"took\" : 0,\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\n  \"_shards\" : {\n    \"total\" : 5,\n    \"successful\" : 5,\n    \"failed\" : 0\n  },\n  \"hits\" : {\n    \"total\" : 348,\n    \"max_score\" : 1.0,\n    \"hits\" : [ {\n      \"_index\" : \"indexname\",\n      \"_type\" : \"estype\",\n      \"_id\" : \"6037_2\",\n      \"_score\" : 1.0,\n      \"_source\":{\n      /* Source omitted */\n      }\n    } ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n  Still no facets.\n\n  Is this the expected behaviour or some side effect of mixing setSource and setSize?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
