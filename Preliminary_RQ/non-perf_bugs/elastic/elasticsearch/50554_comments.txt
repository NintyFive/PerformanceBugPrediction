I think we can try making the multiplexer search-time only if any of the filters it uses is search-time (i.e. updateable). I'll have a WIP as a proposal shortly, not however that there seem to be some [general, documented restrictions on using synonym filters in multiplexers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/analysis-multiplexer-tokenfilter.html#analysis-multiplexer-tokenfilter) that are unrelated to this issue,","performed_via_github_app":null}]
