One can use this feature to search any text across all the documents (and on all fields). We are using '_all' in fields while querying elastic search. This yields us the desired results perfectly. Below is the sense example.\n{\n   \"query\": {\n        \"query_string\": {\n            \"query\": anysearchterm,\n            \"fields\": [ \"_all\" ]\n        }\n   }\n}\n\nNow what we want next is the precise relevance of the search result. We want to know, in which all fields, within each of the resulting document, did elastic search found the match for the search term. Thus we want to know the occurrence of the search term, with respect to individual fields, for all the resulting documents.\n\nWe have been searching for this for quiet some time. We have tried 'explain' option while querying, but this does not give field specific count of the search term. \n\nAny kind of help is highly appreciated. We would be really greatfull if anybody can put some insights on this.\n\nThank you.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
