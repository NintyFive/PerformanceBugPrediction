The whole point of scrolling is that you can keep pulling smaller batches of results until you have enough.\n\nThat said, an NPE is always a bug.  I've tried replicating this with two shards and 300,000 documents, but it is working fine for me.\n\nCould you provide the stack trace from the logs so that we can investigate
