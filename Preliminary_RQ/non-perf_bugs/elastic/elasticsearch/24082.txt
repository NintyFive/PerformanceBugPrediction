Run query string query try to match 'A B C'\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -XGET 'localhost:9200/my_index/_search?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"query_string\": {\r\n       \"query\" : \"*A\\\\ B\\\\ C*\",\r\n      \"fields\": [\"city\",\"city.raw\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected match: document 1. Result: no match.\r\n\r\nWhy is this a bug?  The behaviour above clearly does not match what the spec says:\r\n \r\n> Watch this space\r\n A space may also be a reserved character. For instance, if you have a synonym list which converts \"wi fi\" to \"wifi\", a > query_string search for \"wi fi\" would fail. The query string parser would interpret your query as a search for \"wi OR fi\", while the token stored in your index is actually \"wifi\". Escaping the space will protect it from being touched by the query string parser: \"wi\\ fi\".\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\n\r\n1. **The same test case ran against version 5.0 works as expected. -- matching document 1.** \r\n2. ***This issue has been raised and closed (wrongly, I think) a couple of days ago**. You can see it here #24035\r\n\r\nIf you have a workaround, please suggest. I have been stuck at this for quite some days now. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJason\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
