The fact is that **these options override heap size auto-configuration** based on cgroup limits. Surely JVM needs memory beyond its heap size, which is successfully treated with `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage` (by default 25%). So basically on a containerized environment (especially when cgroup limits are controlled), these two parameters are sufficient to control heap properly and moreover they have a default value. So there's no need to control heap by setting xmx, xms, maxram etc - it just works.\r\n\r\nI could not agree more with all the points you gave above.\r\n\r\n> For Docker, we expect most users to mount over a jvm.options ...\r\n\r\nYes, right, but it would be nice to have the jvm.options configurable in the container, for example mountable, use defaults or nothing at all.
