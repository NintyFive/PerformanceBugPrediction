This impacts older OS for which this version of glibc is not available via the OS package manager. This means that the bundled JDK will no longer works on these OS which includes Oracle Enterprise Linux 6, RedHat Enterprise Linux 6, and CentOS 6 (the latest is glibc 2.12). We do not want to be blocked from advancing the JDK, as that would mean either regressing to ship with JDK 11, or shipping with an EOL JDK in JDK 14. For such old OS, this is not an acceptable outcome. Our plan is the following:\r\n - detect when the installed glibc does not meet 2.14\r\n - if the installed glibc does not meet 2.14, skip using the bundled JDK and fallback to JAVA_HOME\r\n - mark this as a known issue in our docs, and also in our release blog\r\n\r\nRelates elastic/elasticsearch#62635","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
