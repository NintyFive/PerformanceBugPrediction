Therefor you also need to provide additional information within the header of the request to Elasticsearch if a client really wants to enable it. That is possible with the following RequestOptions:\r\n```\r\nRequestOptions.Builder requestOptions = RequestOptions.DEFAULT.toBuilder()\r\n    .addHeader(\"Accept-Encoding\", \"gzip\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these two properties Elasticsearch will return a gzip compressed response body. The RestHighLevelClient can send a request with the above request options but it can't handle the response. This feature request contains the option to handle a compressed response within a RestHighLevelClient received from Elasticsearch.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
