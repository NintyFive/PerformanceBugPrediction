version**: 5.0.0 and master\r\n\r\n**OS version**: sysv init distros\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nThe addition of the `ES_JVM_OPTIONS` did not make it to [the debian init script packaging](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/distribution/deb/src/main/packaging/init.d/elasticsearch#L84-L86) or [the RHEL init script packaging](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/distribution/rpm/src/main/packaging/init.d/elasticsearch#L62-L65).\r\n\r\nIn the systemd scripts, all variables are passed through, but not in the init scripts. This blocks anyone from setting ES_JVM_OPTIONS to an alternate location using /etc/default/elasticsearch or /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch. It also prevents any automation from using a non-standard location, and prevents anyone running multiple instances from using the existing init scripts to do it (unless they want a single /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options file that they can't change).","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
