Drupal and Ansible appear to have methods that work. \n\nI would think Ansible's method of connecting the github account would help discourage spam. As in, when their account is blocked on github for spam, it would go away on plugins.es.org as well. \n\nActually testing the code for version compatibility and so on, could be left to the community. If something is broken, they report it on the plugins github issue queue. If it doesn't get fixed, then they report it in plugins.es.org's review/feedback feature. No need for you guys to do anything unless you just want to.\n\nSo, I think most of the work would just be building and maintaining site infrastructure. The community would take care of evaluating the quality of the listings.\n\n@markharwood Um, out of curiosity, why did you close this issue when there were only two posts? That's not much of a discussion. It seems to me that closing this quickly would discourage people from discussing things like the issues you brought up. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/74332415","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9664#issuecomment-74332415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9664","id":74332415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzMyNDE1","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-13T21:45:09Z","updated_at":"2015-02-13T21:45:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jerrac we internally discussed this and we really don't have the resources to handle stuff like this at the moment.

It wasn't indicated that there had been an internal discussion. I assume that discussion happened prior to my issue? \n\nI, personally, wasn't very discouraged.
