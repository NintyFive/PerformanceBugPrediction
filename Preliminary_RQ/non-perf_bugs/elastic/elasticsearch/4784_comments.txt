It would avoid the need for using explicit mappings (`=>`), avoid the need to map shorter to longer terms, and avoid the need to duplicate the input in the output of the mapping.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/48714692","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4784#issuecomment-48714692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4784","id":48714692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzE0Njky","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-11T10:13:56Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T10:13:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@timbunce you know that if you specify synonyms like `ne,north east` instead of using the `=>`then all synonyms are output?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/48714863","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4784#issuecomment-48714863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4784","id":48714863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzE0ODYz","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-11T10:16:07Z","updated_at":"2014-07-11T10:16:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i think this solves your issue and this ticket can be closed?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68068512","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4784#issuecomment-68068512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4784","id":68068512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDY4NTEy","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-24T18:32:37Z","updated_at":"2014-12-24T18:32:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No more info after 6 months - closing.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
