I use ES as a nosql db, so the data must be strictly same as data in relational database. i use java client and tcp mode to submit the data ES server,  after that save the data in the oracle, all this code in a same method with spring transaction.  Can this method guarantee data consistency?\r\n\r\nBTW, i know the kafka has provide the send transaction with db data, does ES has a same plan?\r\n\r\nThx.\r\n\r\n<!-- Bug report -->\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`):\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: []\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`):\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system):\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1.\r\n 2.\r\n 3.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
