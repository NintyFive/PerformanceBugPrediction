Howover, we found all 40 * 2 shards are allocated to the 5 new machines on saturday, which cause a lot of bulk rejections.\r\n\r\nWe have encounted this problem before on another cluster, and now we use index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node to control shard allocation when add new nodes.\r\nAlthough it works, but is trouble to operate when manage many clusters. \r\n\r\nWe wonder that is this a known issues?
