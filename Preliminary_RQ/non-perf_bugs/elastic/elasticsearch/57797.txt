This can happen if, for instance, a node leaves and rejoins the cluster since shard fetching may occur concurrently with the shard shutting down. This seems unnecessarily harsh: we already obtained the store snapshot so we should just return it. It doesn't seem to matter if `IndexWriter#deleteUnusedFiles` fails here, the files will be cleaned up when the engine restarts.\r\n\r\nI didn't see an obvious reason for throwing `AlreadyClosedException` from `InternalEngine#releaseIndexCommit` so I think a simple fix would be to catch and suppress that exception there.
