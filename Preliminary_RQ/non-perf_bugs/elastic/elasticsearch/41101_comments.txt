There is something about the Oracle Linux 6 CI machines that causes this.  It started between builds 313 and 314, so between 19:38 and 23:19 UTC on 25th March.  I cannot see any code changes in ml-cpp, elasticsearch nor infra that explain this.  I think the only way forward is to get a debugging machine set up that has the same configuration as the Oracle Linux 6 CI machines.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/482148614","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41101#issuecomment-482148614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41101","id":482148614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjE0ODYxNA==","user":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-11T14:54:48Z","updated_at":"2019-04-11T14:54:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"elastic/ml-cpp#459 should fix this.
