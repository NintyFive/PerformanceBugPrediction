While you can turn on/off dynamic mapping at the type level and within any object/nested field, you can't decide not to add a flat field based purely on the name, eg there is no way of saying:\n- add and field matching `foo_*`, but no others, or\n- don't add fields matching `foo_*`\n\nWhile this could be supported, it would be quite an expensive way of doing it as we could potentially have to run the dynamic templates several times on every single document (for every field which has not been added and which will not be added).\n\nI'd say a better solution to this is to use dynamic true/false with objects to namespace allowed/disallowed fields.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
