There only workaround I can suggest is trying to find an approximation of the result by moving the formula outside the aggregation - `SUM(duration) / 60 / coefficient` - if `coefficient` is also another field then only workaround would be to precompute that (which means reindexing the data which is far from ideal).\r\n\r\nLastly, this is a tracker for bugs for missing features, like that you
