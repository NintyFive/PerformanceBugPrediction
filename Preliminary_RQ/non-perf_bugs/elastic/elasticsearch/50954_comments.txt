Because these file system locks require IO, Gradle defaults to holding this locks optimistically until another daemon requests it to avoid having to release and reaquire the lock over and over. The other daemon requests the lock via TCP, but this issue above results in the daemon incorrectly advertising wrong addresses. The workaround I put in place didn't seem to solve the issue on our MacOS workers but since we're now on Gradle 6.1 this issue can be closed.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
