Even if you don't need to index into that index any more, the cluster status is red which means you have to disable monitoring of it until the index is deleted. The allow primary flag allows you to accept your loss and go back to normal. I see it used frequently after multi nodes failures where primary and replica are gone.\n\nOn 30 okt. 2015 11:15 AM +0100, Clinton Gormleynotifications@github.com, wrote:\n\n> A suggestion made in FixItFriday was to remove the parameter entirely.
