I found some interesting behavior on a single node cluster.\n1. After a river is created, a river can be deleted, and a new river with the same river name can be created without problems.\n   \n   curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_river/_meta' -d ' { ... }'\n   _river runs_\n   curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/_river/my_river/'\n   _river stops_\n   curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_river/_meta' -d ' { ... }'\n   _river runs_\n2. But when the node is being shutdown after river deletion, and the node is being started up again, there is a response, but no reaction and no activity when re-using the river name.\n   \n   curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_river/_meta' -d ' { ... }'\n   _river runs_\n   curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/_river/my_river/'\n   _river stops_\n   _node stop_\n   _node start_\n   curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_river/_meta' -d ' { ... }'\n   _no river activity_\n\nThe only workaround I am aware of is to use a different river name, e.g. by enumerating rivers (my_river_1, my_river_2 ...) \n\nIs this behavior intentional? I think it should be possible to re-use a river name in any case.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
