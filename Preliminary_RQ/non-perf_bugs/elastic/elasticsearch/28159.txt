then source /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch; fi` line of elasticsearch-env, it will override the ES_PATH_CONF set within the service for the 2nd instance with /etc/elasticsearch again, and the 2nd instance will end up picking up /etc/elasticsearch (the 1st instance's config directory). \r\n\r\nTo workaround this, I have commented out the line in the elasticsearch-env so that it will pick up the right ES_PATH_CONF already set in the service script (in fact, this is what the puppet module has to compensate for as well) - probably not the ideal solution here for it will break on upgrades (alternatively, use a different ES_HOME for the 2nd instance).  \r\n\r\nThis feels like a bug - not sure why elasticsearch-env has to override existing environment variables like ES_PATH_CONF already set by the service script.","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
