However, because all preconfigured factories are constructed up-front by the AnalysisRegistry, a deprecation warning on, e.g. `keyword_repeat` will be emitted for every new index mapping, whether or not that mapping refers to `keyword_repeat`.\r\n\r\nWe should change AnalysisRegistry to only build component factories when they are explicitly specified in mappings; as well as making for better deprecations, this should also allow us to save some memory by reducing the number of unused factories built per-index.","closed_by":{"login":"romseygeek","id":1347065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDcwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1347065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek","html_url":"https://github.com/romseygeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
