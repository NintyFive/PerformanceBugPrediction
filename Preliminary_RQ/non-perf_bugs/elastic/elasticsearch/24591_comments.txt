The JVM will default to using the IPv6 stack with IPv4 mapped addresses unless explicitly told not to (via `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack`). Alternatively, this can be controlled at the OS level with (`net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1`, `net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1`, and `net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=1`). Since there's no harm in using the IPv6 stack with IPv4 mapped addresses, I see no reason to auto-disable Elasticsearch from using it, I think it should require explicit action on the part of the user. They can disable the IPv6 stack if this is a problem for them, or just `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack` to tell Java to only use the IPv4 stack.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/300551656","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24591#issuecomment-300551656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24591","id":300551656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDU1MTY1Ng==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-10T17:17:13Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T18:22:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, I think it would be quite complicated to even come close to getting this right.
