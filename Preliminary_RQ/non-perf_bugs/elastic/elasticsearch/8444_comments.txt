If you have a server providing plugins with a b0rked SSL certificate then you can as well just not use SSL.\n\nThere might be cases where you use self-signed certificates, but even then it would be better for you to explicitly allow those certificates. At the moment this would require some changes to the script and PluginManager, so one could come up with a patch that loads a keystore from a well-known place (`config` directory of ES?).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62733006","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8444#issuecomment-62733006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8444","id":62733006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzMzMDA2","user":{"login":"ankon","id":1210641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTA2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1210641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon","html_url":"https://github.com/ankon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-12T15:13:59Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T15:13:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR #8453 removes the trustmanager without replacement.
