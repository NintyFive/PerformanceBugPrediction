I think that the problem here is that you have a jvm.options file in `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` that isn't being updated when you install Elasticsearch via Homebrew, likely because you've made modifications to it from a previous installation.\r\n\r\nI think that your `jvm.options` file currently has a line that reads like `9-:-Xlog:gc*,gc+age=trace,safepoint:file=logs/gc.log:utctime,pid,tags:filecount=32,filesize=64m`\r\n\r\nbut it should read:\r\n\r\n`9-:-Xlog:gc*,gc+age=trace,safepoint:file=/usr/local/var/log/elasticsearch/gc.log:utctime,pid,tags:filecount=32,filesize=64m`\r\n\r\nYou could make this edit yourself manually, or we can re-install Elasticsearch to ensure that you pick up all of the latest modifications to jvm.options.\r\n\r\nTo address this, please follow these steps:\r\n1. If you have modifications to `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options`, make note of those somewhere.\r\n2. `brew uninstall elasticsearch-full`\r\n3. `rm /usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options`\r\n4. `brew install elasticsearch-full`\r\n5. Re-apply your modifications to `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options` \r\n\r\nI hope this helps.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/549817477","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48859#issuecomment-549817477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48859","id":549817477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTgxNzQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"rehannali","id":22426977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDI2OTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22426977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehannali","html_url":"https://github.com/rehannali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehannali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehannali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehannali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehannali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehannali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehannali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehannali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehannali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rehannali/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-05T13:14:45Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T13:15:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jasontedor **Big Thanks**.
