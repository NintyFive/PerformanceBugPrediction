Almost all of those classes either exclude Docker explicitly or select a specific packaging type other than Docker. The one exception? `DockerTests`, which extends `PackagingTestCase` but modifies the setup before each test by setting the `Shell` object to a new `DockerShell` and setting the `installation` object with `runContainer`.\r\n\r\nIf I want to make the `KeystoreManagementTest` class run correctly for Docker, it seems like I would have to push that Docker-specific `shell`/`installation` setup into the `PackagingTestCase` class. Is that something you tried doing while you were writing these test cases? Do you think there's any reason that approach wouldn't work in principle?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/565977917","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49469#issuecomment-565977917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49469","id":565977917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTk3NzkxNw==","user":{"login":"pugnascotia","id":8696382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTYzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8696382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia","html_url":"https://github.com/pugnascotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-16T09:29:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-16T09:29:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I didn't try that approach, but it certainly sounds reasonable.
