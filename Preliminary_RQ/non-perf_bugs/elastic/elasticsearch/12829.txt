This can lead to problems with class loading (eg #10290, #3557, #4660), and requires us to have hacks to ensure that our version of Joda is loaded first.  \n\nWe should investigate the possibility of replacing Joda with java.time.  One roadblock would be the need to reimplement the dateOptionalTimeParser, which doesn't have an equivalent java.time.
