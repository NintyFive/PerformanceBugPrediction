For example:\n\n```\n{\n   \"size\": 0,\n   \"query\": { ... },\n   \"aggs\": {\n      \"widget_a_max\": {\n         \"max\": {\n            \"field\": \"widget_a\"\n         }\n      },\n      \"widget_b_max\": {\n         \"max\": {\n            \"field\": \"widget_b\"\n         }\n      },\n      \"widget_ratio\": {\n         \"bucket_script\": {\n            \"buckets_path\": {\n               \"a\": \"widget_a_max\",\n               \"b\": \"widget_b_max\"\n            },\n            \"script\": \"a / b\"\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nI keep running into this when trying to calculate ratios: you generate a number of metrics across potentially several aggs, then you just want to calculate a ratio of those metrics.  Often you end up in a situation where there is no bucket that holds all the data, and the only viable place to do the calculate is in a sibling.\n\n/cc @colings86 \n","closed_by":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
