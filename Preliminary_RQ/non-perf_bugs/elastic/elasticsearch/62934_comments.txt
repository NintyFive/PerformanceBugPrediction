I think we probably have two options:\r\n\r\n- Change the return signature to Double as suggested, although that might just move the NPE somewhere else\r\n- Check to see if extendedBounds is `null`, and if it is, return -/+ `Infinity` for min/max bounds.  E.g. if the bounds aren't set, then that is comparable to having the bounds == positive and negative infinity.  I suspect that's a better option since we won't be returning nulls, although `Infinity` has it's own strange issues too :)\r\n\r\nFeel free to work up a PR, we can review it and see what @imotov thinks when he gets back :)  Or you can wait and see what he thinks before getting started.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/714911280","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62934#issuecomment-714911280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62934","id":714911280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDkxMTI4MA==","user":{"login":"alishahusain","id":43160608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTYwNjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/43160608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alishahusain","html_url":"https://github.com/alishahusain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alishahusain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alishahusain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alishahusain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alishahusain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alishahusain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alishahusain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alishahusain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alishahusain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alishahusain/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-23T04:57:31Z","updated_at":"2020-10-23T04:57:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!
