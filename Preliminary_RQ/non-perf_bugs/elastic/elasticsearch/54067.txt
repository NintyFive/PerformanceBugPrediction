is a followup to #53763.\r\n\r\nCurrently when you start a job that has `allow_lazy_open`/`allow_lazy_start` set to `true` a success response does not make crystal clear whether the job has started work immediately or has started lazily and is waiting for capacity to become available.\r\n\r\nWe could make this much clearer by adding another field to the response of the open job, start datafeed and start data frame analytics job endpoints.\r\n\r\nFor example, we could have:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"opened\": true,\r\n  \"awaiting_lazy_assignment\": true\r\n}\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"started\": true,\r\n  \"awaiting_lazy_assignment\": true\r\n}\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"acknowledged\": true,\r\n  \"awaiting_lazy_assignment\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr we could use a different field name instead of `awaiting_lazy_assignment`.","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
