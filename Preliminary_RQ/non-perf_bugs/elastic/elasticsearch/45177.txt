However, it does not currently account for shards that have been chosen for relocation to a node but whose assignment to a data path has not yet been observed by the `ClusterInfoService`. In particular, it ignores relocations triggered earlier on in the same reroute process, because these relocations have not been published to the cluster so their effects cannot have been observed.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly problematic if `cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries` is set to a high value (e.g. `10`): if the shards are large enough then this may cause the target node to breach one or more watermarks, possibly requiring further allocations away from the node to fix.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
