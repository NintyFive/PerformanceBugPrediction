The time zone of the `rounding` inside an InternalDateHistogram is set to \"Z\" ([Zulu time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/z)) which seems to be equivalent to UTC. For versions before 7.0 we don't directly write the zone ID but convert to a string representation which in this case gives \"UTC\". This is deserialized to a \"UTC\" time zone which is equivalent but fails our strict equality checks.\r\nI'll mute the test for now and work on a fix.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/573738893","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50827#issuecomment-573738893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50827","id":573738893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzczODg5Mw==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-13T16:06:56Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T16:06:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Should be closed by https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/50845","performed_via_github_app":null}]
