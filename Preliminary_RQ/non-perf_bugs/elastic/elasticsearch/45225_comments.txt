is still/again relevant, though it has been updated in the meantime.\r\n\r\nthis affects all releases: the dependency to jackson-databind is on an outdated version which contains known security

2.8.11.6: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.8\r\nplease at least update to that.\r\n\r\nhowever, please also note that 2.8 is officially no longer supported, their current releases are 2.9 (maintenance only) and 2.10 (open, full support): https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Releases\r\n\r\ndepending on whether you can easily directly update to 2.10 also on your fixpacks i'd suggest that you might first update to 2.8.11.6 and cherry-pick that to all supported ES releases and then upgrade to 2.10 on master.\r\n\r\nplease note that this vulnerable dependency causes a security finding for us and prevents us from rolling out ES. others seem to have the same problem (see #53335 & #51650).\r\n\r\nplease don't close this issue with the comment that this should be send to security@elastic.co: this is not some new 0-day in your code, this is something which any dependency-scanning software will tell you, including free online services. this can be addressed like any normal bug and it can be fixed by anyone, not just security

this affects all releases: the dependency to jackson-databind is on an outdated version which contains known security problems.\r\n\r\nI want to stress, which we have in a few places, that we are not exposed to *any* of the reported security issues. We understand that they cause problems for scanners, but from a security perspective, there is no issue exposed in Elasticsearch. We will investigate upgrading the dependencies. Tactically we will try upgrading to the 2.8.11.6 in our current release branches, and separately, investigate whether or not we can upgrade to the 2.10 series. In the past, there were serious performance regressions in the 2.9 and 2.10 series, so we will have to proceed more carefully here.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
