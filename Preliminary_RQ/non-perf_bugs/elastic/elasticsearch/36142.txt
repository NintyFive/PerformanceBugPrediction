It would be needed to move the data out of the node before de-installation of `elasticsearch` and after installation of `elasticsearch-oss` the re-ingest. \r\n\r\nHaving either a clear communication that this upgrade path is not possible or have the option to use that would be nice. \r\n\r\nData, and data structure is not the matter in this task - it is simple the settings for the RPM that provide a clean update!\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Use Centos7 installation\r\n 2. Install Elasticsearch 5.6 (RPM)\r\n 3.
