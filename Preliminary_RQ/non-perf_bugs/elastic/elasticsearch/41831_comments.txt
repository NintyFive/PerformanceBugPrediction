Loading plugins allows them to execute code. The keystore tool is not currently locked down by the security manager. Plugins are untrusted, so we can't let them execute code without a security manager. Ergo, we can't know what are valid and invalid settings in this context.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/490473583","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41831#issuecomment-490473583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41831","id":490473583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDQ3MzU4Mw==","user":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T12:52:29Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T12:52:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The issue isn't with adding it to the keystore (which we would like to prevent, but aren't in a position to do so) but that the node will start without complaint and ignore the non-secure setting you added to the keystore.\r\n\r\nIn my example, I would expect `bin/elasticsearch` to fail with something like \"node.master is not a secure setting\"","performed_via_github_app":null}]
