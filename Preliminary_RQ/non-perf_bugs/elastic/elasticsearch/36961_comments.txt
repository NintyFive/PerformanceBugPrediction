But we also set the job version to current when migrating from cluster state to an index.\r\n\r\nI think the solution is to add the model memory limit uplift logic into `MlConfigMigrator.updateJobForMigration`.  This will guarantee that every job that is stored in the config index has had the uplift applied if appropriate.  In the master branch the logic can be completely removed from `TransportOpenJobAction`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/451230287","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36961#issuecomment-451230287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36961","id":451230287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTIzMDI4Nw==","user":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-03T18:17:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T18:17:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixes are #37125 for 6.6/6.x and #37126 for master.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
