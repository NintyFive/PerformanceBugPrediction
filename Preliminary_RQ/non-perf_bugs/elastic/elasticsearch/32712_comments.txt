It's hard to understand your problem if you don't describe what you want to achieve and the operations you've made on your cluster. Can you add the mapping of your index and an explanation of why a suggestion should not occur. The `collate` query can be used to ensure that the `suggestion` can match documents, in your example the `collate` query is the same for all suggestions so any suggestion will be returned if the shard has at least one document that match the `collate` filter.
