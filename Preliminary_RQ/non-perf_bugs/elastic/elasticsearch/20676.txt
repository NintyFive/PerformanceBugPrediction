When I specify a `bool` clause with two `must` terms, the highlighting occurs when either of the `must` terms match.  I would expect this to behave more like a regular `bool` query, where all `must` terms must match in order for a document to be returned.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Create a simple index with one document and two fields:\n   \n   ``` json\n   {\n   \"field_1\": \"value_1\",\n   \"field_2\": \"value_2\"\n   }\n   ```\n2. Query the document with two `must` clauses under `highlight_query`:\n   \n   ``` json\n   {\n   \"highlight\": {\n       \"fields\": {\n           \"*\": {\n               \"highlight_query\": {\n                   \"bool\": {\n                       \"must\": [\n                           {\n                               \"match\": {\n                                   \"field_1\": {\n                                       \"query\": \"value_1\"\n                                   }\n                               }\n                           },\n                           {\n                               \"match\": {\n                                   \"field_2\": {\n                                       \"query\": \"no match\"\n                                   }\n                               }\n                           }\n                       ]\n                   }\n               }\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   }\n   ```\n3. The document is improperly matched:\n   \n   ``` json\n     \"hits\": {\n         \"hits\": [\n             {\n                 \"_id\": \"AVdurOuxCEUee5q0MANw\",\n                 \"_index\": \"cluster\",\n                 \"_score\": 1.0,\n                 \"_source\": {\n                     \"field_1\": \"value_1\",\n                     \"field_2\": \"value_2\"\n                 },\n                 \"_type\": \"doc\",\n                 \"highlight\": {\n                     \"field_1\": [\n                         \"<em>value_1</em>\"\n                     ]\n                 }\n             }\n         ],\n   ```\n\nI would expect there to be no `highlight` section in the query response because the document does not match the `must` clause specified under `highlight_query`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
