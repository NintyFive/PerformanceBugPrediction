For example `field_a` need to be converted to an integer. If the field doesn't exist or can't be its value can't converted to an integer this processor fails.\n\nThe idea is here the add an `auto` convert type option that tries to convert strings to either a integer/float or a boolean value based on simple rules:\n- true | false -> boolean \n- [-+]?[0-9] -> integer\n- [-+]?[0-9]_.?[0-9]_ -> float\n\nIf the `auto` convert type is unable to convert than it just does nothing and leaves that field untouched.\n\nIn order to auto detect a number fields it would be helpful if the `field` option would support wildcards too. \nFor all fields that match the convert processor will convert the values based on the configured convert type. If no fields match with the wildcard pattern than the `convert` processor does nothing.\n\nI think if this gets implemented then this can supersede number detections in mappings?\n","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
