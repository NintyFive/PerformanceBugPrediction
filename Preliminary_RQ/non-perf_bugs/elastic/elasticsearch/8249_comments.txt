The size does not take the size of the cache keys into account, because this info is difficult to access.\n\nPreviously, cached filters used 1 bit for every document in the segment, so the sum of the size of the values worked as a reasonable heuristic for the total amount of memory consumed.  When the cache filled up with too many values, old filters were evicted.\n\nNow, cached filters which match (almost) all docs or (almost) no docs can be represented in a much more efficient manner, and consume very little memory indeed.  The result is that many more of these filters can be cached before triggering evictions.  \n\nIf you have:\n- many unique filters\n- with long cache keys (eg `terms` filters on thousands of IDs)\n- that match almost all or almost no docs\n\n...then you will run into this situation, where the cache keys can consume all of your heap, while the sum of the size of the values in the cache is small.\n\nWe are looking at ways to deal with this situation better in #8268.  Either we will figure out a way to include the size of cache keys in the calculation (difficult), or we will just limit the number of entries allowed in the cache (easy).\n\nWorkarounds for now:\n- Reduce the size of the filter cache so that evictions are triggered earlier (eg set `indices.cache.filter.size` to 2% instead of the default 10%, see http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-cache.html#node-filter)\n- Use a custom (short) `_cache_key` - see http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-terms-filter.html#_terms_lookup_twitter_example\n- Disable caching on these filters\n- Manually clear the cache once a day or as often as needed (see http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-clearcache.html#indices-clearcache)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/61068502","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8249#issuecomment-61068502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8249","id":61068502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMDY4NTAy","user":{"login":"johnc10uk","id":7994397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTQzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7994397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnc10uk","html_url":"https://github.com/johnc10uk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnc10uk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnc10uk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnc10uk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnc10uk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnc10uk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnc10uk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnc10uk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnc10uk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnc10uk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-30T10:01:40Z","updated_at":"2014-10-30T10:01:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley as far as getting the size of the cache keys, is that something that could/should be added to Lucene API?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/61075560","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8249#issuecomment-61075560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8249","id":61075560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMDc1NTYw","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-30T11:05:58Z","updated_at":"2014-10-30T11:05:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@johnc10uk no -

It helped. However, IMO the problem is much bigger then you think. we have found the following:\n1. The ID cache is also having the same problem as Field data and filter cache. we had to stop using all our parent-child queries.  This was not a big loss as this model is practically not usable since it is way too slow.\n2. THE MAIN problem is the  cluster management. When a node id crashing after OOM cluster management does not recognize that and then:\n3. Calls for the status api return all green\n4. Cluster is not using replicas and queries never return \n\nOur production cluster is crashing every day. The workarounds suggested reduce the number of crashes on our test env and will be implemented in production.\nThe main problem though, is the cluster recovery.\n\nLet us know what other info/help you need in order to fix.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/61370666","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8249#issuecomment-61370666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8249","id":61370666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzcwNjY2","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-01T14:56:05Z","updated_at":"2014-11-01T14:56:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Yakx it sounds like you have a number of configuration issues, which are unrelated to this thread.
