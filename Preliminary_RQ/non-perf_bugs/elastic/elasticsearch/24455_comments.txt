The only thing that should really change is the uri scheme (hdfs, webhdfs, etc.).\r\n\r\n> I think hadoop client files are better than the actually conf. options.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm inclined to agree (mirroring those configurations on the REST request is not the most straightforward thing, especially if they're already in file format), do consider that to access and read configuration files on disk we are required to declare file access rules in the plugin security policy. Trying to account for where a user chooses to place those configs in the security policy is potentially just as obtuse as mirroring the configurations onto the request. Perhaps it would be better if we could load these from a designated location like the conf directory.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/299660904","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24455#issuecomment-299660904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24455","id":299660904,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTY2MDkwNA==","user":{"login":"AndreAga","id":1497308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTczMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1497308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreAga","html_url":"https://github.com/AndreAga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreAga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreAga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreAga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreAga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreAga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreAga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreAga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreAga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreAga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-06T19:27:14Z","updated_at":"2017-05-06T19:27:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Perhaps it would be better if we could load these from a designated location like the conf directory.\r\n\r\nYeah, maybe it's better if a user put all the required files in the config directory, I didn't think about that.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/559213980","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24455#issuecomment-559213980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24455","id":559213980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTIxMzk4MA==","user":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-27T19:02:26Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T19:02:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ywelsch @jbaiera maybe we should close this one?
