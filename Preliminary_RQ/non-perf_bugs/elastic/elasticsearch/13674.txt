ES-2.0.0-beta2 (and also in ES-2.0.0-beta1), when an exception in thrown from a native \nsearch script, Java node clients no longer seem to receive any indication that something went wrong.\n\nFor example, we have a native sort script that takes a parameter and throws an exception in case it is missing:\n\n``` java\n    private static class MyFactory implements NativeScriptFactory {\n        @Override\n        public ExecutableScript newScript(final Map<String, Object> params) {\n            if (params.get(\"field\")== null) {\n                throw new ScriptException(\"missing parameter: field\");\n            }\n            ...\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public boolean needsScores() {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nhowever, the following integration test, that used to work with ES-1.7.1, now fails:\n\n``` java\npublic abstract class MyScriptIT extends ESIntegTestCase {\n    @Rule\n    public ExpectedException _exception = ExpectedException.none();\n\n    @Test\n    public void testMissingFieldFails() throws Exception {\n        createIndex(...);\n        ensureGreen(...);\n\n        _exception.expect(SearchPhaseExecutionException.class);\n        _exception.expectMessage(\"missing parameter: field\");\n\n        final Map<String, Object> params = new HashMap<>();\n        final Script script = new Script(\"my-script\", ScriptType.INLINE, \"native\", params);\n        final ScriptSortBuilder script = SortBuilders.scriptSort(script, \"number\");\n        return _client.prepareSearch(...).addSort(script).execute().actionGet();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nin fact, no exception at all is thrown\n\n```\njava.lang.AssertionError: Expected test to throw (an instance of org.elasticsearch.action.search.SearchPhaseExecutionException and exception with message a string containing \"missing parameter: field\")\n...\n```\n\nin addition, it appears that \n- scripted fetch fields, scripted metrics also don't propagate any thrown exceptions.\n  e.g. AggregationBuilders.sum(\"sum\").script(...)\n  e.g. AggregationBuilders.scriptedMetric(...)\n- update scripts on the other hand still do return exceptions. \n  e.g. return _client.prepareUpdate(\"test\", \"test\", id).setScript(...);\n  However, the returned message always is \"failed to execute script\", \n  while it used to contain the message that was generated by our native script.
