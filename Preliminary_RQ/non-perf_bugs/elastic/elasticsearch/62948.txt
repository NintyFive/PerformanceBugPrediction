Reproduced using an Elastic Cloud cluster.\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\nThis is regarding the update of an anomaly detection job's custom rules with a filter list while the job is open. It is expected that after the job config is updated with a filter list, any document processed by the job will be filtered.\r\n\r\nAlthough the job update succeeds and the job config shows the updated custom rules, documents that match items in the filter list are still coming through.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Create an anomaly detection job.\r\n 2. Open the job, but don't start the datafeed.\r\n 3. Update the job's custom rules with a filter list that matches some documents in the source data.\r\n```\r\nPOST _ml/anomaly_detectors/job_with_filters/_update\r\n{\r\n  \"detectors\" : [\r\n    {\r\n      \"custom_rules\" : [\r\n        {\r\n          \"actions\" : [\r\n            \"skip_result\",\r\n            \"skip_model_update\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"scope\" : {\r\n            \"field_to_filter\" : {\r\n              \"filter_id\" : \"items_to_ignore\",\r\n              \"filter_type\" : \"include\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"detector_index\" : 0\r\n    }\r\n  ]  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n 4. Start the datafeed.\r\n 5.
