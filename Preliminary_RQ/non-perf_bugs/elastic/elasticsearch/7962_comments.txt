The issue here is that when we try to look up an object mapper that has `bar` as a path, we get the root object mapper since `bar` is the name of the type (which is weird to me, I need to check if we have things that rely upon it).\n\nSo in the end we try to match on `bar.*`, which doesn't match any field, so we return a `match_all` filter.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/61809917","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7962#issuecomment-61809917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7962","id":61809917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODA5OTE3","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-05T13:56:59Z","updated_at":"2014-11-05T13:56:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm closing in favor of #4081, the issue here is that elasticsearch tried to interpret the first part of the field name as a type.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
