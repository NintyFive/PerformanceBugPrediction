Currently we only support `target_field` on `convert` and `date`, with it defaulting to `@timestamp` for the `date` processor.  I think it is OK to always use `field` to mean \"the field we're getting the value from\" and `target_field` to mean \"the field we're applying the change to, which defaults to `field`\"\n\nSeems pretty clear to me.  And the benefit of consistency makes it less likely that users will get confused.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/212455486","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17835#issuecomment-212455486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17835","id":212455486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjQ1NTQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T14:48:02Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T14:48:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The `geoip` and `attachment` processors also have a `fields` option, which controls what properties from maxmind db and tika are used to enrich the document being processed.
