It contains two data nodes and one controlling node. Both data nodes contain the same index, `test`, with a single document in each. One data node is running off `:9201`, the other off `:9202`. The controlling node is running off `:9220`.\r\n\r\nThis request is good:\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9201/t/_search -i\r\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this request is unexpected:\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9220/*:t/_search -i\r\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\r\n```\r\n(`curl -XPOST localhost:9220/cluster_one:t/_search -i` and `curl -XPOST localhost:9220/cluster_two:t/_search -i` return the same 500 too.)\r\n\r\nI'm assuming the connecting node is detecting the 404 from the data nodes and is converting that into a 500, but I'm not sure it should do that. The connecting node should probably inspect the type of error and return the same error type instead of the 500.","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
