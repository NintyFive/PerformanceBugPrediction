Probably there are more.\r\nSo I need some way to convert date from one of possible types to a single type.\r\nThe method `WatcherDateTimeUtils#convertToDate` does similar thing, but it's not available inside a Painless script.\r\n\r\nOf course I can do it right in the script, but it will be very ugly. And easily available method can be used for other purposes.\r\n\r\nIf such functionality already exists, please tell me and I'll just use it.","closed_by":{"login":"Hohol","id":2988117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODgxMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2988117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hohol","html_url":"https://github.com/Hohol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hohol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hohol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hohol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hohol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hohol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hohol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hohol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hohol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hohol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
