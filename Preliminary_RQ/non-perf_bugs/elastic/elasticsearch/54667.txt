have created a stylesheet to make it easier to delineate nested objects in the API reference pages: https://github.com/elastic/docs/pull/1786\r\n\r\nWe have already implemented it in machine learning APIs like https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/get-dfanalytics-stats.html and https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ml-put-job.html\r\n\r\nIt involves setting `[role=\"child_attributes\"]` on the section that contains nested objects, then putting the objects in collabsible sections, which default to open for search purposes.\r\n\r\nThe following APIs contain nested objects and would likely benefit from this layout too:\r\n\r\n- [x] [cluster reroute](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/cluster-reroute.html)
