Although this might sound expensive, this is very likely to be very cheap compared to the query execution: there are usually less than 50 segments in an index while queries can easily match thousands or millions of documents. And it also has some advantages compared to the current approach:\n- this number will be accurate,\n- this number will only take into account segments that are wrapped by the searcher while something implemented at the index field data level could only return a number which is global to all live segments in the index.\n\nThis method isn't used currently in master so it will be easy to remove. Regarding 0.90, I plan to deprecate it in order not to break plugins that may rely on that method.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
