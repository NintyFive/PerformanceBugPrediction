Many settings make more sense when presented in the context of particular features (such as [ILM settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-settings.html). A single page documenting every setting would be of limited use.\r\n\r\nOur overall setting documentation could be improved, but I think that's a separate issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
