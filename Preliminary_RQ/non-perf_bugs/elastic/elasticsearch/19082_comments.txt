Unlike min_master_node (which is used when ever nodes join and leave the cluster), gateway.recover\\* settings are only used during the initial cluster state recovery, when a cluster is formed for the first time. You should use these setting to prevent the master from starting to allocate shards before all nodes have joined, creating unneeded chatter. This means we can't store it in the cluster state because at that point it's not yet recovered (we have long terms plan to change things in that area, but for now this is how it works).  How ever, it is worth while to go and change the setting in the elasticsearch.yml files on the master nodes when the cluster size changes - it will be used in the next cluster outage. \n\nI'm closing this for now.
