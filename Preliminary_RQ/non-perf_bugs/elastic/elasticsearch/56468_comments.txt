What you're seeing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsiginfo: EXCEPTION_IN_PAGE_ERROR (0xc0000006), reading address 0x00000197d0c8a000\r\n```\r\n\r\nis likely the result of your network file system failing to execute a write by Elasticsearch, leading to the JVM failing on this exception on the next access to whatever file failed to write. Note that it is generally not advisable to run Elasticsearch on a NFS. You can find more information on this in this [thread](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/why-nfs-is-to-be-avoided-for-data-directories/215240) on our discuss forums.\r\nSince we try to limit Github to feature requests and confirmed bugs I hope you don't mind that I'm going to close this issue. If you want to further discuss this or other topics that aren't necessarily confirmed bugs I would refer you to the above linked discuss forums.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
