Moreover, there would be diminishing return of value, I suspect, for profiling query after query after query. Better to be able to _sample_ on a timed or counted basis.\n\nA profile API - or perhaps a keyword arg, could facilitate that. Whatever the indexing agent is could be configured to post to this endpoint on a either the time or count periodic basis.\n\nIf you _really_ want to profile every. single. document. then go for it.\n\nYeah, the API approach puts really nice granularity into the hands of the user.\n\nIt could conceivably accept some URL params to indicate desired verbosity or operational granularity (if such a thing is even feasible, breaking down further into the time spent in each analysis phase for that document, or, on another axis, breaking it down per field).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/372763672","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10379#issuecomment-372763672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10379","id":372763672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjc2MzY3Mg==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T18:07:42Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T18:33:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In almost three years we have seen no feedback from the community on this feature request.
