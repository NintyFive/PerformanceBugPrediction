ICU 54.1 is oldish (~ 2 years).  Lucene's ICU analyzers in 6.3 is based on ICU 56.1, but that's also ~1 year oldish, and ICU is now up to 58.1 currently (released last month).  Why doesn't ES's ICU plugin track Lucene's ICU versions?\n\nBut that said, analyzer backwards compatibility is tricky, because you really need all indexed documents into an index (and any future searches against that index) to use the same analyzer versions, even if you did a major ES/Lucene version upgrade at some point.\n\nAnd the Lucene project does not require that changes to analyzer behavior can only happen on major releases.  The major release backwards compatibility promise is only about the low-level index format for reading and writing, now how the tokens were created from incoming text.  I'll open an issue now to upgrade ICU to 58.1 for Lucene 6.4.\n\nNet/net I don't think ES should make back-compat promises around analysis.  Lucene tried this for a while, requiring a Version parameter to all analysis components, but that was too much and we removed it.  I think, instead, we should document that if you use the ICU plugin, you must fully re-index, even within a minor release, if the ICU version has changed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/258645713","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21352#issuecomment-258645713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21352","id":258645713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODY0NTcxMw==","user":{"login":"mikemccand","id":796508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/796508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemccand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-05T22:09:52Z","updated_at":"2016-11-05T22:09:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
