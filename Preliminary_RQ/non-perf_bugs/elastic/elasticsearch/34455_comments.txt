We try to reserve Github issues for bug reports.  This looks to be a latency issue related to how Azure FS is implemented.\r\n\r\nWe generally do nor recommend network attached storage.  E.g. a [small blurb from the Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/hardware.html#_disks)\r\n\r\n> Finally, avoid network-attached storage (NAS). People routinely claim their NAS solution is faster and more reliable than local drives. Despite these claims, we have never seen NAS live up to its hype. NAS is often slower, displays larger latencies with a wider deviation in average latency, and is a single point of failure.\r\n\r\nNot an Azure expert, but it appears Azure FS is basically a SMB 3.0 shared file system, which fits with the above warning about NAS and higher latency.\r\n\r\n[A more recent tutorial about setting up on Azure](https://www.elastic.co/blog/deploying-elasticsearch-on-microsoft-azure) recommends using Premium Storage, which I believe equates to local instance-attached SSDs.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
