However, the node is an auto-generated base-64 UUID. Collisions can happen with the truncated UUID, but they are not likely (you need ~2.4 million nodes to have a 50% chance of a collision (it's the birthday paradox with 64^7 birthdays)). If this concerns you, you can set a node name explicitly.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/260690492","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21565#issuecomment-260690492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21565","id":260690492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDY5MDQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-15T16:27:56Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T16:27:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"For reference, here's the [code](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/253032b4a7818992af360097e3ddc1475fa7b044/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/rest/action/cat/RestAllocationAction.java#L144) the prints the full node name.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/260719105","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21565#issuecomment-260719105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21565","id":260719105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDcxOTEwNQ==","user":{"login":"HariSekhon","id":2211051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTEwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2211051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HariSekhon","html_url":"https://github.com/HariSekhon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HariSekhon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HariSekhon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HariSekhon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HariSekhon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HariSekhon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HariSekhon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HariSekhon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HariSekhon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HariSekhon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-15T18:08:16Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T18:08:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah now I realize it's the name generation mechanism that changed in 5.0 which has broken my CI tests for the version upgrade. I understand you've probably made this change to increase randomness for auto-generated node name, I'm not worried about collisions it'd only be an issue if it was actually truncating real names which are more likely to have a shared prefix in some companies with server naming conventions, was more just about the consistency between the two, I had worked around this but given this info I've improved the fix, thanks very much for the explanation.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
