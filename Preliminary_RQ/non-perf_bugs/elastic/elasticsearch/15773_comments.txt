Github is reserved for bug reports and feature requests.\n\nFields in elasticsearch must be a single data type.  You can store longs in a double field, or vice versa, but you will lose precision in the process.  It sounds like you are using dynamic mappings, which is why you care about the \"first value\". Instead, you can explicitly set your mappings, and the values in your documents will (by default) be coerced to that type (ie passing a long value, but with field mapped as double).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
