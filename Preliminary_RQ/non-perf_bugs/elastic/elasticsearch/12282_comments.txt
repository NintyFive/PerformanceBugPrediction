This means that they are not guaranteed to immediately be exposed once an indexing operation is done. To make sure we take this into account the testing infrastructure explicitly delays those updates on a random basis. \n\nIf you need to check for anything that is async in nature you can use the assertBusy utility method (check the code base for example).\n\nNote that in 2.0 this is no longer the case and mapping updates are guaranteed to be processed before indexing is started. I'm going to therefore close this. Thx for reporting!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
