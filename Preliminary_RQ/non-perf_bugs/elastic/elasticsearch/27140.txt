When getting a document in **Sense** i.e. GET index/type/id with a script_fields object in the request payload, the original document is overwritten **entirely** with the raw value of the script_fields content.\r\n\r\nI didn't expect that getting a document could update and overwrite the document itself.\r\n\r\nThis only seems to happen when performing operations in Sense. Running the same Get with a payload using **curl** does **not** overwrite the document.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nIn sense:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a test document\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT /test/test/1\r\n{\"field1\":\"value1\", \"field2\": \"value2\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n 2. Confirm doc exists and contains expected content\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /test/test/1\r\n```\r\n\r\n 3. GET doc with script_field in request\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /test/test/1\r\n{\r\n  \"script_fields\": {\r\n    \"test\": {\r\n      \"script\": \"doc[\\\"message\\\"]\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Confirm doc's entire content's overwritten with `\"doc['message']\"`\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /test/test/1\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3919957/32104333-3d839234-bb24-11e7-876d-b440ba4aaa72.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
