This would be useful in scenarios where you want to update a document and possibly take additional actions if the update caused certain values in the document to change. The current alternative is to do a GET operation before the update, but then you can run into possible timing issues. Not mention you take the additional network call to perform the GET.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
