This is problematic because:\r\n\r\n- usage of single quote has been deprecated/removed `'` and thus should `?'` \r\n- `?\"` makes it hard to define regex/patterns containing double quotes\r\n- `?` is a valid regex character and while it is not conflicting, it can be confusing to the user:\r\n`?\"?ab\"`\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to replace raw-string declaration with triple quotes, `\"\"\"` since the same character (double quotes `\"`) is used and the risk of clashes (and thus forcing escaping) is minimal.\r\n\r\nBased on the info in #61659, there are 21 rules, 0.8% that use `?\"` and 8 rules/0.33% that use `?'`  from an total of 2389 rules.\r\nThat's a total of 29 rules or 1.13% that will be affected by this change.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
