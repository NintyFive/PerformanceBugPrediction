I have also replaced the ruby gem that performs the HTTP calls (switching from httparty to http.rb) and stopped having the problem.\n\nI still wonder if there is something in elasticsearch that could make that issue or if it is all about httparty that would maybe perform a query on the object after his deletion.\n\nAnyway, this does not seem to be an bug in elasticsearch.\nThank you once again,\nBruno\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
