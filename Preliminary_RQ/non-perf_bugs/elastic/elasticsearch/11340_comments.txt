Either:\n- you have two fields with the same name with different mappings in different types in the same index (#8871), or\n- you are using dynamic mapping and two shards have ended up mapping the same field as different data types (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8688).  when one shard gets moved to a different node it applies the data type as specified on the master, which can clash with the data type stored on disk\n\nBoth of these issues will be fixed in 2.0 (see #8870).  For now, the only solution for now is to (fix your mappings in the first case, then) to reindex your data.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/282192169","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11340#issuecomment-282192169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11340","id":282192169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjE5MjE2OQ==","user":{"login":"nidgupta","id":5141371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDEzNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5141371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidgupta","html_url":"https://github.com/nidgupta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidgupta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidgupta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidgupta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidgupta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidgupta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidgupta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidgupta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidgupta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidgupta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-24T03:12:10Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T03:12:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I also faced the same issue of dynamic mapping ended up with different data types on 2 shards. we are not yet on 2.0, so as work around I snapshotted and restored the index, all good now.
