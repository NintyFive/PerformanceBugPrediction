There are phases for query failed and fetch failed which could be used to push to the slow log. Yet, I do not see a compelling reason to do this. Seeing how there has been on interest in nearly two-and-a-half years, I will close this issue. We can always reopen the issue or open a new issue based on compelling feedback.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
