I'm really impressed with elastic search. \r\n\r\nI'm a teacher and I take online classes, I also have a paid lab environment where students can follow my video and perform the activity accordingly. For e.g I've SQL, NoSQL databases preinstalled, students can interact with them and learn SQL/NoSQL in the lab environment.\r\n\r\nI was planning on adding on Elastic search, so that students can interact with it and learn how to perform operations on elastic search. \r\n\r\nI went through the Elastic License and I wanted to verify whether I can use the commercial code and deploy elastic search for teaching in a lab environment to students online. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping using elastic search in the lab environment will come under section 6.8 \"Non-production Environment\".\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
