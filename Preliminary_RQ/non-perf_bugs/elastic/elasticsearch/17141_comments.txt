This might be in relating with the above suggestion.\n> \n> E.g. if you wanna know if the query contains a field 'color' with the value 'red' - just as a boolean. Maybe even provide an array of values.\n\nSorry, I have no idea what this means, but it seems unrelated to the doc_count issue so I'm going to close this.  If you want to provide more details of your suggestion please open another issue.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
