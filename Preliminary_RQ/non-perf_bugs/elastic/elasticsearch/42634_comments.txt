I would strongly advise using one of the [existing ones](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/similarity.html) and tweak the relevance of certain terms e.g. by boosting those terms in your application. The later is a question better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
