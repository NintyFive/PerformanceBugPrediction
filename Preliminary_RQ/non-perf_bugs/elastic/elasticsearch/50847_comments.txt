It sounds like you're already aware that we made the [core security features of the stack free](https://www.elastic.co/blog/security-for-elasticsearch-is-now-free) in version 6.8 and above, including authentication, RBAC, and Kibana Spaces. While we're always trying to re-evaluate and strike the right balance, at the moment we don't have any plans to change the license level of our OIDC integration. \r\nI'll close the issue, as it's not something that we plan to do now, but weâ€™ll take your request into account going forward.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
