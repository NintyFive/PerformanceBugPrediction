Switching to using /_nodes does show the node details so the Elasticsearch node has the information, it's just not presenting it via the _cat API.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. docker run -ti -p 9200:9200 elasticsearch:5.0\r\n 2. curl http://host:9200/_cat/fielddata\r\n 3. results in no output where before it was populated with a table of node details\r\n 4. curl http://host:9200/_nodes which shows the info is available inside Elasticsearch, it's just not presented via the _cat API any more, which seems like a bug","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
