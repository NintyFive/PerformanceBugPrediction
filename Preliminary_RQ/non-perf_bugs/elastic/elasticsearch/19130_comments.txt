You can work around this by filtering on `_uid` instead:\n\n```\n{\n  \"filter\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"_uid\": \".percolator#query_1\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: percolation has changed completely in 5.0.  Instead of the percolate API we now have the percolate query, which is just part of the query DSL.  As such, the rest of the query DSL will work as expected.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/230410453","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19130#issuecomment-230410453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19130","id":230410453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDQxMDQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T07:53:57Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T07:53:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closed via #19210\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
