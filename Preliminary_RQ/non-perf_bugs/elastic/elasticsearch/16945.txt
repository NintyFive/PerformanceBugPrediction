Create an index with the above dynamic template.\n2. Index a document that has a text field.\n3. Query the field mappings `localhost:9200/<index_name>/_mapping/*/field/*?include_defaults=true`\n4. Notice that the [fieldName].raw field is missing\n\nI tried the same dynamic template with `\"match_mapping_type\": \"*\"` instead of `text`, and the raw field appeared as expected. I also tried the same multi field mapping on a regular field instead of a template, and that also worked. So this seems to be a problem with the combination of `text` fields and dynamic templates in particular. \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
