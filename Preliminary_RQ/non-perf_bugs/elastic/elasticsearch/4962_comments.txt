If you don't use full pathnames to refer to your fields, Elasticsearch finds the first matching fieldname and uses that.  If you search on `name` then you may end up with the top level `name` field or the `properties.name` field.\n\nTo distinguish between them, prepend the `type` name as well:\n- `issue.name` \n- `issue.properties.name`\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
