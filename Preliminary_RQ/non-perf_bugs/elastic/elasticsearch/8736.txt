The query references a field name that has a different casing.  As we know, ES treats field names with different casing as different fields.  So the query is effectively referencing an \"invalid\" field name.   \n\nIf the query contains a sort, an error is thrown on the invalid field.  But if the query contains a filter against the same invalid field, an error is not thrown.  Is there a reason why in the sort use case we are not allowing the query to process (eg. still execute the query and fallback to sort using _score)?\n\n```\nDELETE seq\nPUT seq\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"type\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"SequenceNumber\": {\n          \"type\": \"double\",\n          \"doc_values\": true\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nPOST seq/type/1\n{\n  \"SequenceNumber\":1.0\n}\n\n# Error is thrown when filter is referencing an \"invalid\" field\n# Parse Failure [No mapping found for [sequenceNumber] in order to sort on]]; }]\",\nGET seq/type/_search\n{\n  \"sort\": [\n    {\n      \"sequenceNumber\": {\n        \"order\": \"desc\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n# No error thrown when filter is referencing an \"invalid\" field\nGET seq/type/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"range\": {\n          \"sequenceNumber\": {\n            \"from\": 0,\n            \"to\": 20\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
