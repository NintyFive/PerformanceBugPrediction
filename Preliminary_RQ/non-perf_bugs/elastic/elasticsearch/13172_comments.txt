In the past, types could have different mappings for fields of the same name but that is no longer supported (caused a lot of issues).\n\nSo yes, you could quite happily store different types in different indices.  Types can make sense in a scenario such as the following:\n\nYou have a million documents of type `blogpost`, you have 100 million documents of type `comment`, and you have 1000 documents of type `user`, and 5 documents of type `user_group`.  Having a separate index for `user` and `user_group`may be wasteful (as each shard consumes memory, file handles etc).  So for convenience you can just store them as separate types in the main index.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/135778449","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13172#issuecomment-135778449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13172","id":135778449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTc3ODQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"ycombinator","id":51061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/51061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator","html_url":"https://github.com/ycombinator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-28T13:43:18Z","updated_at":"2015-08-28T13:43:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @makeyang,\n\n> sorry, I am in china and I don't know why I can't visit discuss.elastic anywhere.
