It looks like the documentation didn't get updated form the previous incarnation of the settings (which were never released).\n\nI think we should only allow the object definition and not allow `compression` on the root level. This is the way the parsing works in the code today. This makes the parsing easier in code and makes it easier to explain the syntax to users. If you are just using the defaults then you don't need to specify anything and you get tdigest with compression set to 100. If you want to change the settings then you must define the method as well as the settings so it is explicit. Otherwise we could end up with situations where a user specifies compression at the root level and hdr as the method and doesn't realise why this doesn't work.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/157724097","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14691#issuecomment-157724097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14691","id":157724097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzcyNDA5Nw==","user":{"login":"gmarz","id":1594777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ3Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1594777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz","html_url":"https://github.com/gmarz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-18T14:10:15Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T14:10:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@colings86 Agreed, that makes sense.\n\nA bit of nit pick though, but probably worth nothing: the null checks [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/metrics/percentiles/AbstractPercentilesParser.java#L151) and [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/metrics/percentiles/AbstractPercentilesParser.java#L160) aren't necessary as these
