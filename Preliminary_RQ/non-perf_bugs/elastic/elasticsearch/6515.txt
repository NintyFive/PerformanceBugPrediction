When the cluster is idle during some time the problem occurs (between 0:00 and 8:00 am). \n\nI saw the sockets log in the cluster and there is a lot of sockets opened (like 700 in one of them). And because of that I load-balancer node is throwing out of memory.\n\nI'm using TranportClient to connect to cluster. My environment is:\n- 15 ES nodes with 7 shards and 2 replicas (7 data nodes (16Gb each one), 4 load balancers(4Gb each one), 4 masters(4Gb each one)); \n- 8 clients pointing to the 4 load-balancer nodes.\n\nWhen the cluster is being used (during the day), this problem does not happen, but every first connection of the day catch this error.\n\nI created a discussion on Google Groups as follows:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/elasticsearch/marcelopaesrech/elasticsearch/ZqypeTOguoM/8qunqmONggoJ\n\nBest regards.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
