during peer recovery, we replay operations from the translog of the primary to the replica. This is to build a history of operations on the replica, in case that it would become a primary. Unfortunately, this is currently fatal for peer recovery of a follower shard after the primary shard has recovered remotely.\r\n\r\nWith recovery from remote, we copy over the index files and there is no translog replay phase. Assume the simple case of a newly created follower doing its initial recovery from the leader. If the leader does a flush before the follower initiates recovery from remote, after recovery from remote the follower will be fully caught up all primary shards of the follower will have empty translogs. When a replica shard of the follower attempts to recover from the primary shard of the follower, we want to replay translog from the local checkpoint of the commit, to bake a history of operations for it. Since the primary shards of the follower have empty translogs, this replay can not happen and recovery will fail.\r\n\r\nImmediately I see two possibilities:\r\n - `InternalEngine#readHistoryOperations` could serve operations from the Lucene history instead of the translog; however, this interplays with the need for shard history retention leases to interplay with recovery to ensure that these operations exist\r\n - the primary shards of the follower could build their own translog from Lucene history after remotely recovering files\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this issue is to tracker this as a blocker for all versions of CCR that support recovery from remote, and to initiate discussion on these options (and others).\r\n\r\nRelates #38633","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
