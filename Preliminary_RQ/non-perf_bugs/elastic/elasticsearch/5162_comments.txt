That might be fixable with a few select annotations, but still I'd rather avoid that since they are straight copies.\n- Aborting the build is not possible as-is because javac is dumb as a rock; these warnings are specific to the Eclipse compiler. For a continuous overview (or even aborting the build) something like publishing Findbugs/PMD reports would be much more effective (also more thorough since findbugs is really intelligent) and can be automated easily, esp. since ES is a single project. The question then becomes what \"useful\" warnings/alerts are, which is an entirely different discussion for another time. FWIW I think Findbugs would be awesome since it is much more intelligent and can be extended with custom problem finder plugins (like, e.g. verifying refcounting).\n\nFor now I really just want to get rid of the majority of _unnecessary_ warnings so that we can then focus on the ones that might be either false positives (\"tricky\" code like the assert check etc.) or actual potential problems.

Note that this does _not_ imply severity for potential bugs.\n\n| Frequency | src | test | Description |\n| --: | --: | --: | :-- |\n| 1453 | 207 | 1246 | \"raw type\" |\n| 565 | 420 | 145 | \"Empty block\" |\n| 491 | 491 | 0 | \"Access restriction\" |\n| 375 | 134 | 241 | \"deprecated\" |\n| 373 | 304 | 69 | \"Type safety\" (various!) |\n| 229 | 220 | 9 | \"The serializable class has no serialUUID\" |\n| 161 | 99 | 62 | \"The import is never used\" |\n| 111 | 108 | 3 | \"Potential null pointer access\" |\n| 88 | 52 | 36 | \"Unnecessary cast\" |\n| 79 | 24 | 55 | \"The value of the local variable is not used\" |\n| 56 | 26 | 30 | \"Resource leak\" |\n| 55 | 52 | 3 | \"The value of the field is not used\" |\n| 37 | 27 | 10 | \"Unnecessary @SuppressWarnings\" |\n| 13 | 9 | 4 | \"Dead code\" |\n| 12 | 9 | 3 | \"Unnecessary semicolon\" |\n| 9 | 9 | 0 | \"The type parameter T is hiding the type T\" |\n| 7 | 2 | 5 | \"Possible accidental assignment\" |\n| 6 | 4 | 2 | \"The static field should be accessed in a static way\" |\n| 2 | 2 | 0 | \"annotation type Element should not be used as a superinterface\" |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 | \"Comparing identical expressions\" |\n\nThe embedded JSR166 util.concurrent.\\* classes are a pretty big offender all by themselves, mostly due to Unsafe (for CAS/atomics) but also a surprising number of potential NPEs and others.\n\n| Frequency | src | test | Description |\n| --: | --: | --: | :-- |\n| 632 | 632 | 0 | misc. |\n\nAgain, these should not be touched as they are 1:1 copied from the jsr166 repo.\n\nA few observations about the messages and where they occur:\n- \"deprecated code\" is mostly in reference to Lucene classes\n- \"Empty block\" seems harmless, but is anything but: in the absence of documentation (a single comment would do!) it's impossible to decide whether a method is empty because it does not do anything _intentionally_ (overiding a superclass stub), or whether it was added just to silence an interface, was forgotten or still needs to be implemented. This can make refactorings a much worse minefield than necessary.\n- \"Raw types\" and \"Type safety\" are mostly fallout from lack of/abuse of generics. In tests they are often just used out of laziness, in code they can have API impact (when data structures esapce/are exposed as return values)\n- \"Possible accidental assignment\" is AFAICT exclusively due to the asserts, though I think I saw a few occurrences elsewhere (short-circuited branches etc.). IMHO really bad.\n- The missing serialVersionUUID could be used for the serialization/versioning, though IMHO we shouldn't use Serialization at all anyway (in favor of explicitly modeled wire protocols).\n- \"Dead code\" can just be removed; in tests it might indicate old assumptions or assumptions that _seem_ to be verified, but actually are not.\n- \"Resource leaks\" seem universally nasty but may or may not be actual leaks. In most of the tests they refer to Closeables that do not \"really\" need to be closed, since they don't have external references. Still pretty bad IMHO, and sooner or later we will have a need for refcouting/offheap/hard lifecycle control.\n\nSo there you go. I'll let this sit here for now because I have more important things to do, but I hope it's clear that this is more difficult than a single \"fix-it Friday\". We really don't have to \"break this over the knee\" as we say here..\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/35486775","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5162#issuecomment-35486775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5162","id":35486775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDg2Nzc1","user":{"login":"hhoffstaette","id":499973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTk3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/499973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoffstaette","html_url":"https://github.com/hhoffstaette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoffstaette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoffstaette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoffstaette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoffstaette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoffstaette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoffstaette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoffstaette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoffstaette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoffstaette/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-19T10:56:32Z","updated_at":"2014-02-19T10:56:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FWIW (in reference to https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/5162#issuecomment-35423863): a friend of mine recommends SonarQube: http://www.sonarqube.org/ for continuous overview/reporting.
