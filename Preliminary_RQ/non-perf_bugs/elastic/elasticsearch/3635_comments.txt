I mean I could have missed it but it seems like you should really give an example so we can help? What kind of data do you have in the field and what is your query and what do you expect as a result? I'd also appreciate to have this on the mailing list rather than on the dev issues - I will close this since it's not an issue at. Can you please ask this on our mailing list and add more infos\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
