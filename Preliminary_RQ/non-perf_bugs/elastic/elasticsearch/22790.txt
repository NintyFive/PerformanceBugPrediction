This only happens when the object has been initialized with an integer value. If the object has been initialized with a double value, the operator works as expected.\r\n\r\nUsing the assignment operator in conjunction with the addition operator (`ctx._source.value = ctx._source.value + 1.5`), always produces correct results, irrespective of whether the initial value was an integer or a double. In Groovy scripts the `+=` operator works as expected, as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\nYou can reproduce the described behavior by issuing the following commands in Kibana Sense/Console:\r\n\r\nPrepare the scenario:\r\n```\r\nPUT foo\r\nPUT foo/bar/_mapping\r\n{\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"value\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"double\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nPUT foo/bar/1\r\n{\r\n  \"value\": 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis script produces incorrect results:\r\n```\r\nPOST foo/bar/1/_update\r\n{\r\n  \"script\": {\r\n    \"lang\": \"painless\", \r\n    \"inline\": \"ctx._source.value += 1.5\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"_source\":true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis script works as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST foo/bar/1/_update\r\n{\r\n  \"script\": {\r\n    \"lang\": \"painless\", \r\n    \"inline\": \"ctx._source.value = ctx._source.value + 1.5\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"_source\":true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
