I think that expected behaviour should be using the id of the child element when no parent is set.\n","closed_by":{"login":"bakura10","id":1198915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTg5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1198915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10","html_url":"https://github.com/bakura10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
