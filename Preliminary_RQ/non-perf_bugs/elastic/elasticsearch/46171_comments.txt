E.g. `BaseDirectoryTestCase` is a Lucene test class, so if you are extending it directly they would probably have more insight into what's going on.\r\n\r\nIf not the Lucene folks, I would recommend the [Discuss forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/).  We try to reserve the ES repo for bug reports, enhancements, etc.  Help with user issues that aren't a bug are usually better served on the forums.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
