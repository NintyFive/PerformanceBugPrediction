Saying `fields=*` is a shortcut to say \"give me all the fields that are stored in lucene\", which is hard to do when there's no lucene underneath (in case we are retrieving from the translog).\n\nI would suggest you to have a look at a new feature though, that will be available with 1.0, which allows to have finer control over `_source` retrieval for all the relevent apis.
