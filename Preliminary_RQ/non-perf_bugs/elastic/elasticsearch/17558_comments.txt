It'd be nice to document exactly why when we write the docs for the dynamic setting. Maybe this is a thing we should enable on the request instead? It feels like a dynamic setting is too broad. Like, when I ran _source things at WMF I really only ran them on a handful of requests. All hand written, all ones I was willing to wait for. OTOH allowing anyone to override it feels funky. If core ES had users and permissions I'd say \"this should be a permission a user has\".\n\nPoint of clarification: this only applies to searches. It'll be ok by default to put it in `_update` and the mutation script in `_update_by_query` or `_reindex`.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/206395596","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17558#issuecomment-206395596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17558","id":206395596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjM5NTU5Ng==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T14:20:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T14:20:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Maybe this is a thing we should enable on the request instead?

Like the other [safeguards](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11511), this would be a setting the sysadmin could use to turn slow/dangerous stuff off\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/254433046","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17558#issuecomment-254433046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17558","id":254433046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDQzMzA0Ng==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T07:50:57Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T07:50:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This has been done in Painless.
