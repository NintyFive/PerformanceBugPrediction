Comparability will be more work, so what are the compelling reasons for it ?\r\n\r\nThere are two options here.\r\n\r\n1. Have packer build a VirtualBox and a GCP image separately using the same provisioning code. \r\n2. Switch to building a generic image and convert it for the required cloud provider. \r\n\r\n2 is more work however it is something we are going to need to soon anyway. GCP does not have base images for all of the distributions that we test against. So building our own custom images and converting them into GCP images is going to be the future. \r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/510891092","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33806#issuecomment-510891092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33806","id":510891092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDg5MTA5Mg==","user":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-12T13:42:33Z","updated_at":"2019-07-12T13:42:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We have #11593 instead now ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
