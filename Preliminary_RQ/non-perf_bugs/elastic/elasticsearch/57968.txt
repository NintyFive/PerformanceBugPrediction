evaluating ingest pipelines, we determine the full set of pipelines upfront (taking into account default_pipeline and final_pipeline) based on the index name that is included in the incoming

new destination index has its own set of default/final pipelines, but we do not execute them.\r\n\r\nIt would be preferable if the pipelines attached to the new destination were executed, although there are some questions/issues to work through \r\n- if the default_pipeline redirects to a new index, should we still execute the final_pipeline of the original index?\r\n- should we execute the default_pipeline of the new destination, or just the final_pipeline?\r\n- how do we prevent the document from being infinitely redirected between indices (could we set a rule that the pipeline of the destination index may not change the destination a second time?)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"probakowski","id":3896475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTY0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3896475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski","html_url":"https://github.com/probakowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
