Cluster Search works by first connecting to one of the configured seed nodes to retrieve the cluster state of the remote clusters, after which up to three nodes per remote cluster are selected to be the gateway nodes that will handle the actual search requests.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that any node is a potential gateway node, unless you have configured `search.remote.node.attr` to explicitly filter out specific nodes.\r\n\r\nIn line with our general advice to not send any requests to dedicated master nodes, would it be an idea to automatically filter out dedicated master nodes (similar to what our clients do with sniffing)?","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
