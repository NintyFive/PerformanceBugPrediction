The `store.size` only gets updated only after 10 seconds, no matter what.\r\nNot only that, the `_stats` path of the index (`http;//localhost:9200/<indexes>/_stats`) also show the wrong storage size (in the `store` key).\r\n\r\nMaybe important note: this index created from a template.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1. Create index, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:9200/<index_name>\r\n```\r\n\r\n 2. Insert some documents into the index, something around 35 documents in our case.\r\n\r\n 3. Try to request the indices cat output:\r\n\r\n```curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices/<indexes>```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"andrershov","id":600624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDYyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/600624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov","html_url":"https://github.com/andrershov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
