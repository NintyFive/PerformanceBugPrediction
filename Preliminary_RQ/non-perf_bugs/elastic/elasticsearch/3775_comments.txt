The actual default could be something not too strict (e.g. including the ASCII filter), and then switching it to something easier. Something like \"Default English analyzer\", \"Non-ASCII folding English Analyzer\", \"French analyzer\" and so on.\n\nAnother idea is to actually have that filter as a toggle on all known analyzers. I've seen many use cases where you want to use an analyzer, but it doesn't do ASCII folding, but you do want it to. Instead of sub-classing, this could be a great way out.\n\nMight worth noting the actual tokenizer is source for troubles as well - it will now not preserve acronyms neither emails, and some users might have grown to expect that\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/25190381","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3775#issuecomment-25190381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3775","id":25190381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTkwMzgx","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-26T18:14:46Z","updated_at":"2013-09-26T18:14:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The danger that I see by adding too much stuff into the default analyzer is that you always have your own use case in mind.

Nothing more nothing less.  That plus lowercasing makes for a good general purpose analyzer.\n\nWe also have the language analyzers available by default.  I'd consider perhaps making the asciifolding an option there.  but then you have to ask yourself: do you want to strip diacritics, or do you want to index both versions: with and without diacritics.  Suddenly the number of choices start exploding.\n\nWe have a very flexible system for creating your own custom analyzers which do exactly what you want, so I'm not in favour of adding loads of prebuilt analyzers to try to cover every circumstance.

Unfortunately I can't read all the languages I have to support.\n\nNik\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/25197117","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3775#issuecomment-25197117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3775","id":25197117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTk3MTE3","user":{"login":"lukas-vlcek","id":205174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/205174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek","html_url":"https://github.com/lukas-vlcek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-26T19:41:21Z","updated_at":"2013-09-26T19:41:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@s1monw I am sorry.

It took some time since we were very adamant on the fact that the book will be free online, which created complexities signing the contract. We have been open about that, btw, and I specifically answered that question raised by you several times already.\n\nThe work on moving the current guide to asciidoc is all in the open (and has required extensive work), btw, and we plan to obviously continue and improve it, and that is already all in the open. You can already submit pull request if you want to improve the guide docs (as you could before), though as is typical with us, we don't expect you to and will make sure it happens anyhow. For example, your hunspell docs can easily be added to our guide if appropriate.\n\nI assume you didn't mean it that way, even though you stated it in the .oO, but that question could have been asked in a much nicer tone. This is the type of tone that I tried, and we try, to uphold in the elasticsearch community since inception. You should assume no malice, not the other way around.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
