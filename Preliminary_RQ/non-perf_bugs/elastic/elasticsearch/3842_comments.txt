This is not really recommended, unless they are connected to each other very fast and without going over the non-reliability of the internet\n- We changed a bit of code in the cluster state event handling with the 0.90.6 release - so it would be great if you could update to 0.90.7, which was released yesterday\n- The node you are starting up/shutting down, is that a pure client node?\n- Before you spin up the nodes, which fail, can you check the cluster state and see if those nodes are still mentioned in there? Simply check the output of `http://localhost:9200/_cluster/state`\n\n@avleen \nwhat is your use case for reproducing? You stop/start your logstash clients? What are those? Client nodes as well? Do you initiate a clean stop? What is your setup? Every information helps :-)\n\nAlso, is this clearly reproducible for you? So you simply restart a couple of nodes, they try to join the cluster and fail (this is important for me, because maybe we can create a reproducible test case out of all of these information)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/28508903","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3842#issuecomment-28508903","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3842","id":28508903,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTA4OTAz","user":{"login":"pvulgaris","id":1030026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzAwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1030026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvulgaris","html_url":"https://github.com/pvulgaris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvulgaris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvulgaris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvulgaris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvulgaris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvulgaris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvulgaris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvulgaris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvulgaris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvulgaris/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-14T18:24:20Z","updated_at":"2013-11-14T18:24:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- We do have a cluster that spans datacenter's on the east coast, west coast and Europe.
