Defaults to `true`.\n- `cache.memory.small_buffer_size`: The small buffer size, defaults to `1kb`.\n- `cache.memory.large_buffer_size`: The large buffer size, defaults to `1mb`.\n- `cache.memory.small_cache_size`: The small cache size, defaults to `10mb`.\n- `cache.memory.large_cache_size`: The large cache size, defaults to `500mb`.\n\nNote, the cache is global on the node level, and all shards allocated (each with its own lucene Directory) share the same cache.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
