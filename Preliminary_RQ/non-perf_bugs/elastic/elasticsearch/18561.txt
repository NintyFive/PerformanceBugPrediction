It would be great if we could specify other s3 encryption methods, e.g. aws:kms.\n\nFor aws:kms, if the bucket has a default key, it's just a matter of including the correct header, so one possibility may be an additional parameter to specify the value of the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to get sent with requests. But the ability to specify an ams key to use would also be great.\n","closed_by":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
