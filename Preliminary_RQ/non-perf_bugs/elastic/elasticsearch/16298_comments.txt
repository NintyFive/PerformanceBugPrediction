These changes are way too big to backport (and break bwc).  As a workaround, specify the `_all` mapping again:\n\n```\nPUT logstash-example/_mapping/syslog\n{\n  \"_all\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"omit_norms\": true\n  },\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"tags\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
