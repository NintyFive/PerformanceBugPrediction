We usually try to direct those questions to our [discussion forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/), as we reserve GitHub issues for bug reports and development discussions. Would you be able to post the question in the forums instead? We can loop back to file an issue if we find that the problem is due to a bug in Elasticsearch.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/567312316","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50323#issuecomment-567312316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50323","id":567312316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzMxMjMxNg==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-19T03:14:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T03:14:32Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra (:Core/Infra/Core)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/567600700","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50323#issuecomment-567600700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50323","id":567600700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzYwMDcwMA==","user":{"login":"jmwilkinson","id":17836030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODM2MDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17836030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwilkinson","html_url":"https://github.com/jmwilkinson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwilkinson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwilkinson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwilkinson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwilkinson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwilkinson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwilkinson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwilkinson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwilkinson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmwilkinson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-19T18:10:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T18:10:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jtibshirani Sure, done.\r\n\r\nDiscussion topic here: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/cluster-upgrade-from-5-4-5-6-doubled-disk-usage/212539","performed_via_github_app":null}]
