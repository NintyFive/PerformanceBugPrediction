I thought POSTing my data to ES was my indexing process ;-)\n\nMy na√Øve suggestion is to only treat the \"encoding\" property of the mapping's field as a hint to decode the data to then store in whatever way ES pleases. In a way to softcode the implicit base64 decoding of a binary field.\n\nI don't have a need for the exact base16 data. It's just that I have a lot of JSON documents with data already base16 encoded. And I was hoping to have a more friendly way of getting my data into ES than  deserialising everything to JSON, decoding base16, encoding base64, and serialising everything back to JSON.\n\nI know it's doable and I'm in the process of doing that. But maybe it makes a future me a tiny bit happier if I could load not only base64, but also base16, or pretty much anything into a binary field as long as there is an appropriate decoding function (think deflate, rot13, base2, ...).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/144384080","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13836#issuecomment-144384080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13836","id":144384080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDM4NDA4MA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-30T12:38:04Z","updated_at":"2015-09-30T12:38:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'd rather settle on base64 and make sure this is what se use all the time to encode binary data.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/144465179","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13836#issuecomment-144465179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13836","id":144465179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDQ2NTE3OQ==","user":{"login":"jprante","id":635745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTc0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/635745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante","html_url":"https://github.com/jprante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-30T16:18:19Z","updated_at":"2015-09-30T16:18:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@muelli you have the misconception that field type binary for Lucene can also drive the JSON string processing which happens before.\n\nI have created a plugin that can process incoming base16 encoded JSON strings for buk indexing.
