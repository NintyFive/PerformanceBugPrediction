hit the AlreadyExpiredException from updating document with valid _ttl, i.e. _ttl greater than 0.\nHere is my index mapping (simplified), both **_timestamp** and **_ttl** are enabled, and _timestamp is provided with _customized path_:\n\n```\n{\n  \"activity\" : {\n    \"mappings\" : {\n      \"log\" : {\n        \"_timestamp\" : {\"enabled\" : true, \"path\" : \"log_time\"},\n        \"_ttl\" : {\"enabled\" : true, \"default\" : 300000},\n        \"properties\" : {\n          \"log_count\" : {\"type\" : \"integer\"},\n          \"log_time\" : {\"type\" : \"date\"}\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI did some experiments as [documented in this article](https://medium.com/@coxchen/document-obsolescence-in-elasticsearch-c5973dd9e68d) and found that, if I have mappings like above (both **_timestamp** and **_ttl** are enabled, and _timestamp is provided with _customized path_), I'll hit the AlreadyExpiredException from updating document with valid _ttl. I have tried both 1.3.1 and 1.4.2, same behavior.\n\nIs this a known issue? Or is there any design intent behind this?\n\nThank you for your help!\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
