The trickiness here is the support for \"any type\" in a single get request, which returns one of the docs (this was a request raised by the users when get was introduced), and how multi get works, which is just execute each inner get request using the already built in get API (which has the mentioned behavior).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
