Because the first type has default boost the boosting mechanism doesn't seem to kick in. \n\nThere are two possible workarounds here. First, you can make sure that type with non-default boost is processed first: \n\n```\ncurl -XPOST \"http://localhost:9200/test/client,vendor/_search?pretty=true\" -d '\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n      \"query\": \"Mr John Doe\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n'\n```\n\nThe second workaround is to specify something other then 1.0 for the boost of the vendor. Something as simple as this should fix it:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST \"http://localhost:9200/test/vendor/_mappings\" -d '\n{\n  \"vendor\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"boost\": 1.000001\n      }\n    }\n  }  \n}\n'\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/52893620","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6473#issuecomment-52893620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6473","id":52893620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODkzNjIw","user":{"login":"brwe","id":4320215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjAyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4320215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe","html_url":"https://github.com/brwe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-21T08:44:43Z","updated_at":"2014-08-21T08:45:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This seems to be a problem with `query_string`.
