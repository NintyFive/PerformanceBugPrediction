I am anxiously awaiting \"official\" reindexing functionality.  I've been following your commits and the Github issues as best I can, but I confess I'm a bit confused on when this will be RTMed?  Will there be an ES 2.3?  Or will the new \"5.0\" branding be the next version?  Either way, will reindexing go live as part of the next significant release (that is, either 2.3 or 5.0?)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/194504245","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17031#issuecomment-194504245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17031","id":194504245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NDUwNDI0NQ==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-09T20:57:50Z","updated_at":"2016-03-09T20:57:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It'll
