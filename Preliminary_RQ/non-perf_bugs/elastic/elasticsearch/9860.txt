At 1m precision the example shape in https://gist.github.com/nknize/abbcb87f091b891f85e1 consumes more than 1GB of memory.  This is initially alleviated by using 2 bit encoded quads (instead of 1byte) but only delays the problem.  Moreover, as new complex shapes are added duplicate quadcells are created - thus introducing unnecessary redundant memory consumption (an inverted index approach makes mosts sense - its Lucene!).\n\nFor now, if a QuadTree is used for complex shapes great care must be taken and precision must be sacrificed (something that's automatically done with the distance_error_pct without the user knowing - which is a TERRIBLE approach).  An alternative improvement could be to apply a Hilbert R-Tree - which will be explored as a separate issue.  Or to restrict the accuracy to a lower level of precision (something that's undergoing experimentation).\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
