That fix was backported to 2.0 branch but we never made a release with this fix. So now we are still testing against 2.0.2 which does not have the fix. I do not remember why we did not think of that or why it starts failing only now and did not before. Maybe something in CI changed? Anyway, I will change the test to flush before upgrading if version is < 2.0.3 to make sure we don't run into it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
