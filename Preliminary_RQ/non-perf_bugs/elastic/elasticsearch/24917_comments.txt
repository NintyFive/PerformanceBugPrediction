The details can be found in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/26407.\r\nI am closing this issue because this feature would require a complete redesign of the suggest in es (and lucene). Currently contexts are matched independently and there is no way to ensure that we can match all contexts in a single document. This makes context filtering impossible to implement at query time with the expected precision and speed.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
