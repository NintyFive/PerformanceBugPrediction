haven't been able to find a reproduction with the increased logging, but I did spot how there could be a issue with the test. The test relies on updating the internal license state of a node but does not have any protection against a new change overwriting the changed license state.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this test also triggers a NoNodeAvailableException when a node's client is trying to talk to itself. The underlying cause is an Authentication failure due to the license state changing in the middle of authentication. A token gets extracted but cannot be authenticated because the realm is no longer returned by the `Realms` method. While this would be rare in production scenarios, this is a real bug.\r\n\r\nI've opened #38815 to address these items and will have that PR close this issue. If we see failures, we can re-open or create a new issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
