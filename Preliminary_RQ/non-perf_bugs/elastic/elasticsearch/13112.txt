using the 2.0 branch, @jbudz and I are noticing that `_default_` mappings always cause unresolvable type conflicts.\n\nThis is the mapping we are testing with:\n\n``` curl\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9200/logstash-2015.08.25 -d '{\n  \"mappings\":{\n    \"_default_\": {\n      \"properties\":{\n        \"ip\":{\n          \"type\":\"ip\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nAnd the documents that we are sending:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9200/_bulk -d '{\"index\":{\"_index\":\"logstash-2015.08.25\",\"_type\":\"apache\"}}\n{\"index\":\"logstash-2015.08.25\",\"ip\":\"192.168.1.1\"}\n{\"index\":{\"_index\":\"logstash-2015.08.25\",\"_type\":\"nginx\"}}\n{\"index\":\"logstash-2015.08.25\",\"ip\":\"192.168.1.1\"}\n'\n```\n\nBut the bulk fails with `\"Mapper for [ip] conflicts with existing mapping in other types:\\n[mapper [ip] is used by multiple types. Set update_all_types to true to update [search_analyzer] across all types.]\"`. \n\nSince we are using `_default_` as the type, it seems like `update_all_types` should not be needed, since we are not actually creating the types until the documents are indexed.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
