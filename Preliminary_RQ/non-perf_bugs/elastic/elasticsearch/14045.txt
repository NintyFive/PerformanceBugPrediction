Primary network and backup network. Backup network it's not network for emergency this network used by backup system.\nThe primary network is using bonding (using bond0 where its slaves are\neth0 & eth1). The backup network is using eth2 .\nThe issue we are facing is :  when running \"get localhost:9200/_nodes the \"primary_network\" is\neth2 and not bond0. When we try to change the parameter \"network.host: _bond0_\" we got errors :\n\"closing connection java.nio.channels.UnresolvedAddressException\"\nRight now we solve problem by insert bond0 IP address to network.host parameter in yml configuration, but this is pure solution because IP address will be change from time to time. And this is confusing when we see primary_network one IP address and in transport section bound and publish another IP with different mask.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
