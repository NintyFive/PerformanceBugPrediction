It has to do with a race condition between the gateway allocator and the cluster balancer. When the node comes back/allocation is enabled the gateway allocator goes and asks the node for information about it's shard store. This is done async. While that request is in flight, the balanced allocator thinks the node is empty and assigns shards to it. Only later when the gateway allocator assigns the missing shard back to node does the cluster rebalances again. Our idea for a fix was to disable balancing while there are in flight data fetching requests...
