The `type` parameter is used to set the type on the internal get request that the `percolate` query executes to fetch the document being percolated. This two parameters happen to be the same in your case.\r\n\r\nNote that this is more of question than a bug report or feature request and this have been asked on the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/) before opening an issue here.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/311093107","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25393#issuecomment-311093107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25393","id":311093107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTA5MzEwNw==","user":{"login":"eliast","id":26843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliast","html_url":"https://github.com/eliast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliast/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-26T15:25:54Z","updated_at":"2017-06-26T15:25:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry, @martijnvg I definitely should have searched better.
