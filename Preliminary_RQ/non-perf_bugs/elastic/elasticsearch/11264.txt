The option should still remain if the user doesn't actually want it, but the default should switch to make it more convenient to use.\n\nSo instead of this:\n\n``` shell\ncurl -XGET 'localhost:9200/news/item/_percolate' -d '{\n    \"doc\" : {\n        ...\n    },\n    \"query\" : {\n        ...\n    },\n    \"track_scores\" : true\n}'\n```\n\nA user would just specify the query:\n\n``` shell\ncurl -XGET 'localhost:9200/news/item/_percolate' -d '{\n    \"doc\" : {\n        ...\n    },\n    \"query\" : {\n        ...\n    }\n}'\n```\n\nAnd scores are tracked implicitly unless changed.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
