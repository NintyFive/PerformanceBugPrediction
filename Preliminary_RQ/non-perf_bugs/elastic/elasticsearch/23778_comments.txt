This is better than using one path at a time as it parallelizes use of the disks. Additionally, by the proposal here, using a disk until it is nearly filled means that we run dangerously close to not being able to add more data to a shard without it being moved to another disk. I do not think that we should add a feature to only use one disk at a time until it is a threshold is crossed.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/289887770","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23778#issuecomment-289887770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23778","id":289887770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTg4Nzc3MA==","user":{"login":"benkhlifafahmi","id":15172063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTcyMDYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15172063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkhlifafahmi","html_url":"https://github.com/benkhlifafahmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkhlifafahmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkhlifafahmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkhlifafahmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkhlifafahmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkhlifafahmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkhlifafahmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkhlifafahmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkhlifafahmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkhlifafahmi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-28T20:04:08Z","updated_at":"2017-03-28T20:04:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jasontedor  thanks , for your explication.
