First of all, you can add a check to your deserialization logic so it can handle both array and a single integer. Alternatively, since you already store source, you can turn off storing advancedFeatures as a field. This way elasticsearch will always retrieve it from the source and you will get it as an array even if you request it as a specific field. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/12109898","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2525#issuecomment-12109898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2525","id":12109898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTA5ODk4","user":{"login":"bh86","id":78281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/78281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bh86","html_url":"https://github.com/bh86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bh86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bh86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bh86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bh86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bh86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bh86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bh86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bh86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bh86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-10T18:00:50Z","updated_at":"2013-01-10T18:00:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\n\nThanks for your help!\nAbout the first option - I don't have much control over the deserialization of the Json because I'm using a .Net client.\nBut, the second option fixed the problem!
