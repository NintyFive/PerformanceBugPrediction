I suspect such adversaries would not be uncommon in practice...\n\nYet, DiskThresholdDecider only looks at total usable space on the node (not per-path on path.data) so it won't notice when only one path is close to full... we need to fix that?  Also, the shard allocation process needs to see/address each path.data separately somehow?\n\nSometimes a shard would just move from one path.data to another path.data on the same node (maybe we should bias for that, all other criteria being nearly equal, since we save on network traffic).\n\nI think it's important to fix this but this is beyond my knowledge of ES now ...\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
