We have a snapshot that the api call \"_snapshot/<repo_name>/_all\" is listing as IN_PROGRESS, however when attempting to delete that snapshot, it doesn't delete. In fact the delete call just hangs and never returns. When I check the current status of all the snapshots using \"_snapshot/<repo_name>/_status\" that to just hangs and does not return. \n\nI then looked at the cluster state and that tells me that the snapshot is in an \"ABORTED\" state. I can't actually create a new snapshot right now. Any ideas how I can resolve this and is it a bug?\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
