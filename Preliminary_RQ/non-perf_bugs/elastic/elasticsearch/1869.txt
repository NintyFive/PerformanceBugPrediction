For example, { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"test-*\", \"alias\" : \"test\" } } would add an alias that mapped /test to /test-1, /test-2, /test-3, and any other current and future test-* aliases created. This would simplify dated indicies such as a rolling 30 days of data where the oldest day is dropped each night and a new index created. There would be no need to add or remove aliases after the initial one was set up.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jacwright","id":120294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/120294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacwright","html_url":"https://github.com/jacwright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacwright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacwright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacwright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacwright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacwright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacwright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacwright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacwright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacwright/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
