Can I rely on this automatic feature of ES to prevent the doc from being reinserted? Or is this feature purely for internal ES hygiene?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/255972226","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21095#issuecomment-255972226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21095","id":255972226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTk3MjIyNg==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-25T08:34:36Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T08:34:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Can I rely on this automatic feature of ES to prevent the doc from being reinserted?\n\nYes you can, but you need to guarantee that gc.deletes is comfortably higher than the time between processing the delete command and the index one, including things like GC and such. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/372936343","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21095#issuecomment-372936343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21095","id":372936343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjkzNjM0Mw==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-14T08:06:41Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T08:06:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bleskes Is this still something that should be documented?
