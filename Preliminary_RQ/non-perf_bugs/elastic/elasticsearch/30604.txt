I'm therefore proposing the introduction of a Copy processor that does just that.\r\n\r\nThe use case for this is that I'm looking to use a pipeline to transform data from a 'raw' index to a normalized one, and we want to transform a raw field in different ways to produce multiple different normalized fields. In some cases, we may also want the same value copied into multiple fields without transformation (for example, our original document may only have a date field but in our normalized version we want a startDate and an endDate set to the same value).\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this isn't easily possible at the moment but would be relatively easy to implement. I am happy to code up this feature, if there's no reason why it shouldn't be included and it's not already possible through some other route?","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
