I'm not a HTTP specialist - I wasn't aware about that. I'm using a collector that is NOT typically dealing with HTTP responses (over JSON). I expect that some other people \"leave that world\" and use other interfaces to overtake that data to feed non-web applications. Would be worth for an enhancement request to add an additional output format (like \"pretty=true\") that adds that missing LF (and not break the Standard HTTP response)?\n\nIf so, where can a place such an request?\n\nMany thanks in advance,\nJuergen\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/26583031","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3053#issuecomment-26583031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3053","id":26583031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTgzMDMx","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-18T09:35:28Z","updated_at":"2013-10-18T09:35:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @jueadams ,\nhave a look at https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/3748 .
