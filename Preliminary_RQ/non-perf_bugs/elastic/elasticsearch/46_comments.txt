But I do suspect something odd is\ngoing on here.\n\nI am running against 0.4.0. I'll look into upgrading to the master. Do you have\nthe link to a build process?\n\nThese are probably unrelated, but here are various snippets of information that\nmight help:\n1.  I can only get this issue after having the server run for a very long time. I\n   don't know if this is based on time or number of nature of operations. I\n   suspect the latter.\n2.  At times, I can only reproduce the issue with python's httplib client and not\n   using curl, although, I have seen it with curl. A tcpdump of packets shows that\n   the python requests are valid and going out as suspected.\n3.  Python sends the body and headers of a put request in different packets,\n   whereas curl send them together. This is the default behaviour of the\n   python standard httplib module, so urllib, urllib2 and httplib2 will all\n   behave in the same way. I thought this might have been part of the problem,\n   but I no longer see the exception after a full restart.\n4.  I am using Ubuntu 9.10 with the interpreter under sun-java6-jdk. The\n   executeable is being run in console mode (-f). The first time I saw the\n   problem was with logging level debug, although, I think that I have seen in\n   it with logging set to info.\n5.
