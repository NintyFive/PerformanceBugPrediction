not sure. Probably I don't get it right. What we want to do: We want to have scripts available on all environments (local developer machines, production systems, testing systems). Now we have puppet manifests for ES and just creating the script file there. Developers have to copy them to a different folder on their machines. So if we change this scripts, we have to change it at least two times. I think the best would be storing the scripts in our application repo, because its application related logic. But for this we need a configurable script folder. So developers set it in their ES config once to their application repo folder and on production systems managed with puppet, I would set it to the applications deploy folder. With this we can update the scripts as we want, check them in and every machine has it as soon as it pulls the new code. If you can explain me how we can do this with the indexed scripts then we could use this otherwise I would say there is still a need for this config option :smiley_cat: \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/60367917","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6766#issuecomment-60367917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6766","id":60367917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMzY3OTE3","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-24T10:03:56Z","updated_at":"2014-10-24T10:03:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we should take this further and make eg the config file name configurable.\n\nGeneral review of hardcoded filenames required.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/158658717","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6766#issuecomment-158658717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6766","id":158658717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODY1ODcxNw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-21T16:00:01Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T16:00:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed by #12668\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
