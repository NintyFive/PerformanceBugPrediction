It's not a bug. It was a weird combination of things… the first function triggers the upsert since the document that should be updated works fine. The upsert works as expected and a new document with the speciefied field is created. Next time, the script runs, since we have a document now… the .add method fails when the field does not exists … so I need to check first whether the field exists (and probably also if it is an array) before calling the .add method.\n\nBut debugging this was a pain since the painless (oh my) language error is rather vague… switching to the other languages in my despair I got  a null pointer error message that got me on the right track.\n\nIf I may suggest: Maybe you could add to the docs for partial updates some more examples that covers appending data to arrays and checking if field exists.\n\nThanks for your work.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/258832123","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21358#issuecomment-258832123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21358","id":258832123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODgzMjEyMw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-07T13:14:17Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T13:14:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When I try this out using REST I get a nicely formatted error message:\n\n```\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"root_cause\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"remote_transport_exception\",\n        \"reason\": \"[zSttvmn][127.0.0.1:9300][indices:data/write/update[s]]\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"type\": \"illegal_argument_exception\",\n    \"reason\": \"failed to execute script\",\n    \"caused_by\": {\n      \"type\": \"script_exception\",\n      \"reason\": \"runtime error\",\n      \"caused_by\": {\n        \"type\": \"null_pointer_exception\",\n        \"reason\": null\n      },\n      \"script_stack\": [\n        \"ctx._source.hasLiked.add(params.swipedUserID)\",\n        \"                               ^---- HERE\"\n      ],\n      \"script\": \"ctx._source.hasLiked.add(params.swipedUserID)\",\n      \"lang\": \"painless\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"status\": 400\n}\n```\n\nPerhaps the client that you're using is messing with the formatting?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/258832825","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21358#issuecomment-258832825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21358","id":258832825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODgzMjgyNQ==","user":{"login":"florianbepunkt","id":8314202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMTQyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8314202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianbepunkt","html_url":"https://github.com/florianbepunkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianbepunkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianbepunkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianbepunkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianbepunkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianbepunkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianbepunkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianbepunkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianbepunkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianbepunkt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-07T13:17:47Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T13:17:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks.
