I was using this host to also run Logstash, Kibana and Apache for an ELK stack. I've disabled all of my Beats log shippers for the time being, because being unable to snapshot the indices prevents this from being ready for production. Without the input the host cpu/memory metrics look very underutilized, but even now (with an extremely low cpu/io utilization), running the curl snapshot command kills the process on this host.  \r\n\r\nIf there is another more reliable way to take snapshots to be stored on S3, I'd be interested in anything to get this cluster to be stable.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/322453884","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26087#issuecomment-322453884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26087","id":322453884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjQ1Mzg4NA==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-15T12:32:10Z","updated_at":"2017-08-15T12:32:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @samuel-miller, I talked to somebody more familiar with the S3 repository and it looks like your nodes were already  pretty close to the OOM (not sure why) and the S3 just triggers the OOM.\r\nThe error happened in the repository verification step, which is just a small write on the repository, so this alone shouldn't cause it. \r\nSo the interesting question is how the heap situation looks like before trying to do the snapshot.
