We were able to reproduce it 1.0.1 but once we upgraded 1.1.0 it went away. I see that https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/5413 and https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/5440 got fixed in 1.1.0. Maybe they were related. Either way, we're good. Thank you.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
