Furthermore one cannot guarantee, that the next sigar version still works with that elasticsearch version (though it is quite likely).\n\nIs there any specific reason you want exactly that library version working with elasticsearch?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/35806691","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4697#issuecomment-35806691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4697","id":35806691,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODA2Njkx","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-22T16:25:58Z","updated_at":"2014-02-22T16:25:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"closing due to inactivity for now. happy to reopen on more feedback..\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
