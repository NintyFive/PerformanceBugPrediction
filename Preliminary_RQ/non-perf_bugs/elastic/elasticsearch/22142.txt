In *nix systems, it is trivial to be done. But in Windows, it may be done in a hacky way. For example:\r\n\r\n    setlocal enableDelayedExpansion\r\n    set NL=^\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    :: All line breaks above are required\r\n    set ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512M!NL!-Xmx512M\r\n\r\nAnother drawback on Windows is that it can't send signals properly. Thus, by starting Elasticsearch using `elasticsearch.bat -p es.pid` and then using that pid to stop Elasticsearch doesn't work very well. When using `TaskKill` to stop Elasticsearch, it doesn't perform a clean stop process. \r\nI've [tried to create a simple Node.js script to manage Elasticsearch](https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues/405) (start / stop) but it doesn't work well because of Windows limitations.\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting to change the way ES_JAVA_OPTS is defined (it could be all variables in a single line, for example) and to add another way to stop Elasticsearch. All to focus on Windows users experience.","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
