Attempts to reconnect to these nodes will also fail, but may do so very slowly if they are unresponsive. On the other hand, the `NodesConnectionService` takes responsibility for periodically re-establishing connections that have dropped.\r\n\r\nThis means that there's no real need to attempt to re-establish these connections while applying a cluster state update, and #28920 is an example of a situation where it's undesirable to do so. Therefore it seems sensible to skip these nodes.\r\n\r\nNB it's important that the nodes in the cluster state align with the nodes known to the `NodeConnectionsService`, so they can't simply be omitted in the call to `connectToNodes()` above.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
