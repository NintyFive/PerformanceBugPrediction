As the AWS sdk evolves, the many authentication methods are updated in the DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.  Specifically interesting to Kubernetes deployments are the Security Token Service authentication methods. \r\n The STS methods federate alternate Identity providers including web token federation which allows fine-grained IAM roles for Kubernetes service accounts.\r\n\r\nBy using the DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain in place of EC2ContainerCredentialsProviderWrapper, every authentication method that the SDK supports can now be used by Elasticsearch.
