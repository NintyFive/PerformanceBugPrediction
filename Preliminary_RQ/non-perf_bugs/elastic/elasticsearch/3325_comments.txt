With (m)get we have the slight complication of realtime, where the fields are not actually stored _yet_ in lucene. When you specify the fields you want to have in a realtime get, we actually go to the source and extract them for you. For `*` we'd have to go and first figure out which fields are to be retrieved. This doesn't mean we can't do it but just to say it is a bit tricky. \n\nIs there any reason why you are particularly interested in stored fields (as opposed to all document fields)? We are also working on a better way to control how the `_source` field is returned allowing you to only select parts of it as well ( see issue #3301 ). Will this also help your case?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/27674942","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3325#issuecomment-27674942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3325","id":27674942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Njc0OTQy","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-04T10:13:10Z","updated_at":"2013-11-04T10:13:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing this for lack of activity.
