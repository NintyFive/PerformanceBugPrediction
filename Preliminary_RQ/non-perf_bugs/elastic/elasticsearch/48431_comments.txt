the broader question is this: Is ILM even for my use case?\r\n\r\nILM applies when the index is created, or osmething like that? Because we cannot \"update\" a policy, we are left with a very on-your-own \"change the policy\" scenario.\r\n\r\nFrom discussions today, we would need to:\r\n* Find all affected indices\r\n* Create a new policy with _just_ delete\r\n* Apply that policy to those affected indices.\r\n\r\n\"Find all affected indices\" is basically \"Query /*/_settings and select all indices with a specific lifecycle name\" -- Then apply  two steps (create a policy, apply to those indices). Now, if we look at what we're doing:\r\n\r\nFor each item in /*/_settings, If the `index.lifecycle.name` is the name of our policy needing updating, remove the policy and set the policy to the new \"delete only\" policy.\r\n\r\nBut looking at this specific scenario, \"Delete older than 30 days\". The resutl of /*/_settings gives us `index.creation_date` which we could use to select \"index.creation_date older than 30 days\" and then issue the delete call.\r\n\r\nIn these two scenarios, it's _fewer_ steps to just implement ILM myself with curl than it is to create a new policy and apply it to all affected indices, then wait for ILM to execute and hope I did it right.\r\n\r\nThis seems backwards.\r\n\r\nCompare this scenario to Curator:\r\n* We have a policy to manage properties of our indices\r\n* Curator enforces this policy every time it runs\r\n* If we change the retention period, Curator enforces this on its next run.\r\n\r\nWith Curator, the \"create a policy\" and \"change a policy\" are identical steps:\r\n* Write some config\r\n* Deploy it\r\n* Wait for Curator to run\r\n\r\nWith ILM, the \"create a policy\" and \"change a policy\" are very different steps.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/545995661","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48431#issuecomment-545995661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48431","id":545995661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTk5NTY2MQ==","user":{"login":"jordansissel","id":131818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTgxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/131818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansissel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-24T16:22:43Z","updated_at":"2019-10-24T16:22:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a blocker for us using ILM beyond \"hot phase rollover\"","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/546035685","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48431#issuecomment-546035685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48431","id":546035685,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjAzNTY4NQ==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-24T18:06:13Z","updated_at":"2019-10-24T18:06:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I believe the problem stems from a difference in execution style between Curator and ILM. I have an illustration that might help think about the problem.\r\n\r\nIn ILM. You can think of an ILM policy as a factory assembly line (pardon my poor ASCII art)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n           ___       ___       ___\r\nStart --> | 1 | --> | 2 | --> | 3 | --> Completed\r\n           ---       ---       ---\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen an index is first assigned a policy, it begins at the \"start\" and starts executing actions (numbered 1, 2, and 3 above). These actions may be quick, or they may block for a long time (such as waiting for the `min_age` to be met on and index before proceeding). When an index has gone through all of the actions, it moves to the \"completed\" terminal step.\r\n\r\nCurator on the other hand, can be thought of as a list of `if` statements that check the age of the index every time it's run. In some bad pseudo-code it would look something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nindex.rolloverIfNeeded()\r\n\r\n// 1\r\nif (index.age() > \"5d\" && index.needForceMerge()) {\r\n  index.forceMerge()\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 2\r\nif (index.age() > \"30d\" && index.isNotFrozen()) {\r\n  index.freeze()\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 3\r\nif (index.age() > \"60d\") {\r\n  index.moveToColdNodes()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow. Let's tackle the scenario where you want to add a fourth step, a \"delete\" step (but it could be any step). In Curator's case this looks like adding an additional `if` condition to the list of conditions to be checked *every time curator runs*:\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n// 4\r\nif (index.age() > \"90d\") {\r\n  index.delete()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor ILM however, it's a little different. If we change the policy to add the `delete` action. It's like updating a factory assemble line to add a new machine—**all new indices are going to use the new pipeline, but all the previous indices already finished the pipeline**. So the indices already in the terminal/completed step won't be deleted.\r\n\r\nIn our industrial analogy, if we add a machine at the end of the car assembly line to paint the car yellow, all of the previously assembled cars don't immediately turn yellow.\r\n\r\nCurator, on the other hand, is going to all the cars ever created, checking whether they meet the criteria to be painted yellow, and painting them yellow, regardless of what other steps they have previously run or not run.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOkay, hopefully that clarifies the difference in execution model between the two. There are two main ways to tackle the cognitive mismatch this leads to.\r\n\r\n1. We can change ILM's execution model to match something like Curator. This would be a lot of work and a big breaking change, but it's always an option regardless of how good or bad we think it would be.\r\n\r\n2. Make policy execution idempotent. We already started this with #47324 where we skip rolling over indices that have already been rolled over. This would allow use to \"re-apply\" a policy to an index that was in the completed state, and have it re-run through the steps, skipping the ones that were already executed.\r\n\r\nThere are probably other ways to tackle this too, so feel free to leave ideas. This is just the start of a discussion to hopefully frame the mismatch in execution models that we've seen to cause some incorrect assumptions.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/546445585","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48431#issuecomment-546445585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48431","id":546445585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjQ0NTU4NQ==","user":{"login":"jordansissel","id":131818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTgxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/131818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansissel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T17:40:00Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T17:40:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This factory/cars metaphor is a good one. I suppose in this model, we've \"finished\" making the cars, but there's a defect, and now we need to issue a recall to apply a correction of some kind.\r\n\r\nTo do a recall with ILM, we're on our own (Find all affected indices ourselves, carefully apply a new policy, etc).\r\n\r\nTo do a recall with Curator, we just update the curator config.\r\n\r\nThe way I'm thinking about this is that I am not particularly curious about the implementation details. I want a way to describe my retention policy, \"Delete data older than 30 days\" and implementing this with ILM is only possible if we never make mistakes or never change our minds.\r\n\r\nScenarios:\r\n\r\n* We forgot to set \"Delete after 30 days\". Our cluster is now full (all disks are rejecting allocation past the low disk watermark).  How do we correct this?\r\n  * With ILM: We have to do a bunch of work and discovery. We craft a _new_ policy that only mentions \"delete after 30 days\", custom-code some way to identify affected indices, delete the old policy on these indices and apply the new policy?\r\n  * With Curator: We tell curator to delete everything older than 30 days, and it does.\r\n\r\n* We change our minds and want to \"Delete after 60 days\".

That will spit out a list of indices to be deleted. You can pipe it to xargs or do a shell `for i in $(<that command>); do curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/$i; done` to delete those indices.\r\n\r\nOne quick side note (not related to ILM), don't use `index.provided_name` when gathering a list of indices, since this will include any `<` and `>` for date math indices that isn't actually part of the name of the index.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/547509016","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48431#issuecomment-547509016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48431","id":547509016,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzUwOTAxNg==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T16:24:31Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T16:24:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Okay, that got a little bit on a tangent focusing solely on deletions.

One would be that we stored the previously executed steps somewhere in the index lifecycle state. This would allow us to \"re-apply\" a policy idempotently, skipping the steps that had already been executed. Then a user could update a policy to add a delete phase and have the other steps that had been performed be skipped.\r\n\r\nThere are some downsides to this, especially when it comes to policies without a delete, we wouldn't want to allocate a bunch of indices to a warm node, only to turn around and immediately move them to cold nodes just because a user happened to add both allocation steps to a policy that was already complete.\r\n\r\nAnother idea would be to execute the policy of an index in the \"complete\" phase backwards when changes to the policy happened, allowing us to immediately execute a 'delete' action if one were added to a policy where indices had already finished execution.\r\n\r\nNeither of these are fully fleshed out, just some ideas to get us started on brainstorming.
