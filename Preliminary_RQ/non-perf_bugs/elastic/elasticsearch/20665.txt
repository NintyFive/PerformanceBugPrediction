Lucene supports the creation of a heatmap at arbitrary granularity through its `HeatmapFacetCounter`. It was first used in Solr's facet mechanism, but it's usable by any Lucene application. This feature issue adds a metric aggregator `GeoHeatmapAggregator` to accomplish that.\n\nFor example, an aggregation of:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"aggs\" : {\n        \"overlay\": { \n            \"heatmap\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"shapes\",\n                \"grid_level\" : 4,\n                \"max_cells\" : 100000,\n                \"geom\" : {\n                    \"geo_shape\" : {\n                        \"shapes\" : {\n                            \"shape\" : {\n                                \"type\" : \"envelope\",\n                                \"coordinates\" : [\n                                    [-180,90],\n                                    [180,-90]\n                                ]\n                            },\n                            \"relation\" : \"intersects\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMight produce output similar to:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    ...\n\n    \"aggregations\": {\n        \"overlay\": {\n            \"grid_level\":4,\n            \"rows\":7,\n            \"columns\":6,\n            \"min_x\":45.0,\n            \"min_y\":11.25,\n            \"max_x\":180.0,\n            \"max_y\":90.0,\n            \"counts\": [\n                [0,0,2,1,0,0],\n                [0,0,1,1,0,0],\n                [0,1,1,1,0,0],\n                [0,0,1,1,0,0],\n                [0,0,1,1,0,0],\n                [],\n                []\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
