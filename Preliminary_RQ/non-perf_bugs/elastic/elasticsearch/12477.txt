So something happening when paginating with rescore. \n\nFor example,  let say my search DSL query has \"size\" is 1 and \"from\" is 0. It's returning results until \"from\"  is  10,  beyond 10 it's returning empty results. \n\nElasticsearch version : 1.5.2 \n\nPlease check  this issue. \n\nMy sample DSL query for 11th page \n\n{\n  \"_source\": [\"name\",\"id\"  ],\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n      \"query\": \"any keyword\",\n      \"fields\": [\"_all\"]\n    }\n  },\n  \"from\": 11,\n  \"rescore\": {\n    \"query\": {\n      \"rescore_query\": {\n        \"function_score\": {\n          \"script_score\": {\n            \"script\":\"[my script]\",\n            \"lang\": \"groovy\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"score_mode\": \"multiply\"\n    },\n    \"window_size\": 300\n  }, \"size\": 1\n}\n\nSample result for 11th page \n\n{\n\"took\": 21,\n\"timed_out\": false,\n\"_shards\": {\n\"total\": 11,\n\"successful\": 11,\n\"failed\": 0\n},\n\"hits\": {\n\"total\": 14021,\n\"max_score\": 1,\n\"hits\": [ ]\n}\n}\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
