Usually storing the `_source` is the best option and it is on by default.\n\nYour best bet is to work forwards from examples from the docs using curl or sense. Start with the working examples in the docs and make them look like your PHP query. At some point it'll stop working and you should be able to figure out what happened. Either it is a bug or you are doing something that isn't supported.\n\nFor things like this it is more appropriate to ask on discuss.elastic.co\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/240647892","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19942#issuecomment-240647892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19942","id":240647892,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDY0Nzg5Mg==","user":{"login":"EugenyPavlenko","id":1785921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODU5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1785921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EugenyPavlenko","html_url":"https://github.com/EugenyPavlenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EugenyPavlenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EugenyPavlenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EugenyPavlenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EugenyPavlenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EugenyPavlenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EugenyPavlenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EugenyPavlenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EugenyPavlenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EugenyPavlenko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-18T07:42:13Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T07:42:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello @nik9000 !\n\nSorry for writing here again.
