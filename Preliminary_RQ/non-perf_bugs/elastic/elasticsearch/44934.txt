are places in the security code (notably the token service) that perform updates with wait-for-refresh and depend on the refresh interval being short.\r\n\r\ne.g. Kibana has a 30s timeout on token generation, and we may update more than 1 document (e.g during a refresh) so a refresh interval of 15s or more will inevitably cause problems (and does).\r\n\r\nWe should not leave this as a silent problem that needs to be diagnosed and resolved by the user. \r\nOptions include:\r\n- Detect when the refresh is > 10 seconds, and log warnings (least preferred because the log may not be read)\r\n- Detect when the refresh is > 10 seconds and reset it (and log a warning)\r\n- Detect when the refresh is > 10 seconds and automatically fail all affected API calls\r\n- Force a refresh (perhaps only if the refresh interval is > 10 seconds)\r\n\r\nI have no strong view on the solution, but we should do something to protect users from the problem.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
