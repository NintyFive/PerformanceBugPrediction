It can also help to improve performance if you have an extremely long retention period where you rarely query the oldest info. This allows indices to be opened on-demand, then closed when you are done.\n\nHowever, there's a small problem with closed indices: they aren't replicated in the case of data loss. This makes sense because the cluster gives up managing them, but it also can create surprise situations in normal shard loss scenarios (e.g., lost drives).\n\nWithout opening the closed indices, there needs to be some way to force them to be [re-]replicated or to somehow warn that they are not replicated.\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
