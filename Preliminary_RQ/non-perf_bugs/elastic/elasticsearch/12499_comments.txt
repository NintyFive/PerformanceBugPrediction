While Iced Tea OpenJDK 8 may work fine (and many users are using it), it is not currently considered an officially supported Java version.\n\nThe way the documentation is written today (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/setup.html#jvm-version) can be a bit misleading.\n\n> Elasticsearch is built using Java, and requires at least Java 7 in order to run. Only Oracleâ€™s Java and the OpenJDK are supported. The same JVM version should be used on all Elasticsearch nodes and clients.\n> We recommend installing the Java 8 update 20 or later, or Java 7 update 55 or later. Previous versions of Java 7 are known to have bugs that can cause index corruption and data loss. Elasticsearch will refuse to start if a known-bad version of Java is used. \n\nSo let's update the documentation to cross reference the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#show_jvm instead :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/373883605","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12499#issuecomment-373883605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12499","id":373883605,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mzg4MzYwNQ==","user":{"login":"debadair","id":362578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjU3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/362578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair","html_url":"https://github.com/debadair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-17T01:25:04Z","updated_at":"2018-03-17T01:25:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The docs link to the support matrix as of 5.0: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/setup.html#supported-platforms","performed_via_github_app":null}]
