If something goes wrong on this level, indexing operations will be accumulating in memory and nodes can go OOM. We had a couple of things we talked about that could help here:\n\n1) A request circuit breaker with a limit to the total memory of in-flight requests.\n2) A hard but configurable limit to the total number of concurrent operations on a shard. The idea here is that indexing threads will block if there are two many ongoing operations, applying back pressure to the client.\n\nI like #1 better and it's more generic, but #2 is trivial to implement when we get #15956 in. The implementation in that PR has a such limit built in (which we disabled by making it MAX_INT). \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/308672018","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10797#issuecomment-308672018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10797","id":308672018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODY3MjAxOA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-15T08:58:27Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T08:58:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bleskes Do you know if recent changes made this issue invalid or fixed somehow?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/308697824","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10797#issuecomment-308697824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10797","id":308697824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODY5NzgyNA==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-15T10:53:20Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T10:53:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jpountz it's still the same, although we do have a request circuit breaker on the node with the primary now, so if this really accumulates it will start rejecting requests.
