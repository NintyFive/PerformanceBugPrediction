Before 1.0, you could optionally wrap the body of the doc in the `type` name, but from 1.0 onwards you can no longer do that.\n\nSo in the example you link to, instead of indexing docs like this:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT \"http://localhost:9200/org/activity/901\" -d '{\n  \"activity\": {\n    \"title\": \"Engineering\",\n    \"participating-org\": [{\n      \"name\": \"DEF\",\n      \"ref\": \"123CD\",\n      \"role-code\": 3,\n      \"role\": \"Leading\"\n    },{\n      \"name\": \"ABC\",\n      \"ref\": \"123AB\",\n      \"role-code\": 3,\n      \"role\": \"Organizing\"\n    }]\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nyou should index them like this:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT \"http://localhost:9200/org/activity/901\" -d '{\n    \"title\": \"Engineering\",\n    \"participating-org\": [{\n      \"name\": \"DEF\",\n      \"ref\": \"123CD\",\n      \"role-code\": 3,\n      \"role\": \"Leading\"\n    },{\n      \"name\": \"ABC\",\n      \"ref\": \"123AB\",\n      \"role-code\": 3,\n      \"role\": \"Organizing\"\n    }]\n}'\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
