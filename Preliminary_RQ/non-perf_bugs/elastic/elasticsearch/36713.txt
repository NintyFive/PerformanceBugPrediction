I copied the demo code in [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high-document-bulk.html ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high-document-bulk.html ).However, it tells that it can't work and shows that there is no request added to bulkrequest.  then i add one more line of codes as follows\r\n``````\r\nbulkRequest.add(new IndexRequest(\"articles\", \"article\", String.valueOf(j)).source(lineTxt, XContentType.JSON));\r\nbulkProcessor.add(new IndexRequest(\"articles\", \"article\", String.valueOf(j)).source(lineTxt, XContentType.JSON));\r\n``````\r\nthen it works. i dont why? it is supposed that only use bulkProcessor.add which will lead to the bulkRequest's addition of new request.
