There's an active community there that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\nRegarding your questions, the `multi_match` and the `simple_query_string` behaves similarly when the input is not parseable by the targeted field (for a number they throw a number_format_exception if the input is not a number). If you want to ignore these errors and just proceed with the other fields/inputs you can add `lenient:true` to your request:\r\n````\r\nIf set to true will cause format based failures (like providing text to a numeric field) to be ignored.\r\n````","performed_via_github_app":null}]
