The query is executed in the parent document space, which is specified by the parent type. This filter return child documents which associated parents have matched. For the rest `has_parent` filter has the same options and works in the same manner as the `has_child` filter. \n\nThis is an experimental filter.\n## Filter example\n\n```\n{\n    \"has_parent\" : {\n        \"parent_type\" : \"blog\"\n        \"query\" : {\n            \"term\" : {\n                \"tag\" : \"something\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}  \n```\n\nThe `parent_type` field name can also be abbreviated to `type`.\n## Memory considerations\n\nWith the current implementation, all _id values are loaded to memory (heap) in order to support fast lookups, so make sure there is enough mem for it.\n\nThis issue originates from issue #792\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
