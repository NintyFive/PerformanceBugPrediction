IndexShard get's it's index setting using guice and the `@IndexSettings` annotation. This is supposed be supplied by [IndexSettingsProvider](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/1.7/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/settings/IndexSettingsProvider.java) , which in turn asks `IndexSettingsService` for the latest setting. For some unknown reason, Guice decides to cache those settings and thus IndexShard gets a stale copy. This means that if Guice captures an old settings, the settings are changed and then a shard is created, the shard will see the old setting. It does register a setting change listener but as far as `IndexSettingService` is concerned, no settings have changed since the last iteration. This doesn't happen in 2.0 because we don't inject the index setting to the shard anymore but rather ask for a live copy in the IndexShard constructor. Master is of course totally rewritten to another mechanism.\n\nI've put a test reproducing on https://gist.github.com/bleskes/1e336a206a52cb4f1b0f . (based on 1.7 code)\n\nI think we can do one of the following:\n- Fix the Guice issue and make the provider be called every time (I did some looking and this looks like a rabbit hole - unless somebogy knows what needs to be done)\n- Change 1.7 to do what 2.0 does and not inject the index setting to the IndexShard. This is a local fix and we might suffer other simillar issues in the future, so if we go down this route I suggest we remove the index settings annotation and use this mechanism all over the place (in 2.x and 1.7).\n\nThoughts?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/152822794","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14319#issuecomment-152822794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14319","id":152822794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjgyMjc5NA==","user":{"login":"mikemccand","id":796508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/796508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemccand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-01T12:33:11Z","updated_at":"2015-11-01T12:33:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Option 1 sounds scary (I don't like rabbit holes).
