If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. The discussion forums are beter suited to these sorts of troubleshooting and problem diagnosis conversations.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\nTo get you started, the key part of the error is:\r\n\r\n> JAVA_HOME must be set to build Elasticsearch\r\n\r\nand the instructions to help you get set up are here:\r\n- https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-the-elasticsearch-codebase\r\n\r\nPlease read through that document and then head to the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) to ask any questions you have.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
