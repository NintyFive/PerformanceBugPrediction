This is super unexpected pattern as in other places where the DSL has similar requirements it just accepts an object with multiple keys - names of the subaggregations (like `aggs` itself for example or a list of aggregations directly without a name if order is important (like filters agg with anonymous filters).\r\n\r\nAdditionally there is no protection against duplicate names of sources so a following example just uses the second aggregation, silently ignoring the first definition:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl localhost:9200/_search -d '{\r\n  \"aggs\": {\r\n    \"my\": {\r\n      \"composite\": {\r\n        \"size\": 1,\r\n        \"sources\": [\r\n          {\"test\": {\"terms\": {\"field\": \"files\"}}},\r\n          {\"test\": {\"terms\": {\"field\": \"stats.lines\"}}}\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould we perhaps do the same as with `filters` for consistency? Use keyed request if order does not matter (order can be either implicit by key or explicit by specifying `order` key at the top level) or a list of anonymous objects? If not, it would still be great to have protection against duplicate keys - the above example should raise an exception to alert the user they are doing something unsupported.\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
