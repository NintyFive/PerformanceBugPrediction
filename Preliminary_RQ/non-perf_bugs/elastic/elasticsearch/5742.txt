\n\n```\nsnapshotname/indices/myindexname/*\n```\n\nto: \n\n```\n/var/lib/elasticsearch/mycluster/nodes/0/indices/myindexname/*\n```\n\nwill elasticsearch see this as a closed index and provide the ability to online it again?\n\nFailing that, is there any other possible way to salvage data from a snapshotted index that is marked as incomplete, especially if the size of the index appears to be
