In the documentation examples I see, this property is always set in the query. When upgrading to 5.4, I started getting the following error:\r\n`Mapping definition for [fields] has unsupported parameters:  [number_of_fragments : 0]`\r\n\r\nIs defining that property in the field mapping no longer supported in 5.4?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Create field mapping with `number_of_fragments` property set\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n`Mapping definition for [fields] has unsupported parameters:  [number_of_fragments : 0]`","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
