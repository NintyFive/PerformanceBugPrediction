Maybe (since the repository is stored on Github) specific scripts that loads YAML into class' fields should be separated so that a man configuring elasticsearch,kibana,filebeat or logstash could prevent and early detect configuration failures even before copying configurations onto machines that allows --configtest.\r\n\r\nOr a link for tools that you validate it on your own with would be handy.\r\n\r\nThanks for your answer.","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
