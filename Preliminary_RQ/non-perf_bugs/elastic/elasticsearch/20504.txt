Whenever a field that is not declared is received, the parser will barf as the field is not supported by the parser. This is very good when we parse requests so that we make sure that something that gets sent by users which is not supported is not ignored. Rather throw an error so users can fix their request. When parsing from a remote node though this strictness can cause problems because we want to be compatible with multiple es versions.\n\nIf we in the future add one single field to the response of any of the api that reindex from remote relies on (info, search, bulk...) parsing breaks and reindex from remote doesn't work anymore. I experienced this in #20503. I think that reindex from remote should parse the fields that it knows about and ignore the rest, to make sure that we are compatible? Maybe using `ObjectParser` is not the best in this specific case?\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
