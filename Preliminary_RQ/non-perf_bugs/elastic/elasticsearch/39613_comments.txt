am leaning towards closing this, as #25152 is the issue where the possibilities have been discussed. We may not go with OpenAPI or Swagger after all, but I think that this issue has the exact same goal as #25152 , which is to have some kind of spec for request body to be provided in our APIs, and possibly for responses returned as well.
