We'd like to put it behind a proxy, so it's accessible the same way the rest of our monitoring infrastructure is.\n\nHowever, Marvel isn't playing nice when you access it from a proxy.  It makes relative redirects, it makes HTTP requests to URLs outside its path, etc.\n\nExamples:\n\nRelative redirect:\n\n```\n$ curl  $MARVEL_HOST/_plugin/marvel/\n  ...\n  <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"1;url=kibana/index.html\">\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    window.location.href = \"kibana/index.html\"\n  </script>\n  ...\n```\n\nURLs outside the `/_plugin/marvel/` path:\n\n```\nGET /_nodes\nGET /.marvel-2014.10.30/_aliases?ignore_missing=true\nPOST /.marvel-2014.10.30/_search\nGET /.marvel-2014.10.27,.marvel-2014.10.28,.marvel-2014.10.29,.marvel-2014.10.30/_aliases?ignore_missing=true\nGET /.marvel-kibana/appdata/marvelOpts\nPOST /.marvel-kibana/dashboard/_mget\n```\n\nThis behavior makes it extremely difficult to put Marvel behind a proxy.  Is this something you'd consider as an improvement to Marvel?\n\nCheers\n","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
