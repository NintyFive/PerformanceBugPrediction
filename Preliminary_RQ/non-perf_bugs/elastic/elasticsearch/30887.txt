It would be nice to know\r\n2. it could be used by systems like Index-Lifecycle-Management to keep track of relative age of \r\nthe documents within an index. For example, we would only want to move on to the `warm` phase after 7 days. Is this 7 days after the index was created, or rolled over? We believe that it should be\r\nrelative to the rollover date. (see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/30853#issuecomment-391966172)\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nAdd an additional callback action to when the rollover aliases are appropriately swapped to also update `index.rollover_date` on the rolled over index, and then continue the active-shards check before returning the rollover response","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
