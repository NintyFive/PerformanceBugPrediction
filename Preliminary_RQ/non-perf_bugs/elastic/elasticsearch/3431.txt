One question I have is about consistency of the results given the distributed nature of the calculations. Now that ES is moving into the territory of BI it is even more important. Current facet implementation does not guarantee correct counts when ordered by count because distributed calculation and subsequent collation of the results. Will aggregation framework make any such guarantees?\nWithout them BI applications will suffer greatly as businessbusers must have exact and not approximate results. Total count or sum must stay the same matter how we aggregate inside a giben bucket\nThanks\nAlex\n","closed_by":{"login":"roytmana","id":2524911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjQ5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2524911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana","html_url":"https://github.com/roytmana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
