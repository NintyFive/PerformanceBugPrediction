This may occur when no more threads or queue slots are\n     * available because their bounds would be exceeded, or upon\n     * shutdown of the Executor.\n     *\n     * <p>In the absence of other alternatives, the method may throw\n     * an unchecked {@link RejectedExecutionException}, which will be\n     * propagated to the caller of {@code execute}.\n     *\n     * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed\n     * @param executor the executor attempting to execute this task\n     * @throws RejectedExecutionException if there is no remedy\n     */\n    void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor executor);\n}\n```\n\nIt's the `@throws` clause that is violated. However, `EsAbortPolicy` throws an `EsRejectedExecutionException` which does not inherit from `RejectedExecutionException`. This leads to situations that commits like 770186f6cfd1a843f6cfca3df791093459b47f4b need to remedy. This should be cleaned up, but it's probably not a small task.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
