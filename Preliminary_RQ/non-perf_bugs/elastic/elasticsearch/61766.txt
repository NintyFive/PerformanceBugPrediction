In the following scenario, this query can fail:\r\n* The index is sorted, and not all documents have a value for the index sort field.\r\n* We run a `bool` query containing these `must` clauses: a range query on the index sort field, plus another restrictive clause.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is a bug in `IndexSortSortedNumericDocValuesRangeQuery` where we don't always obey the `DocIdSetIterator` contract. In particular, even when `advance` returns `NO_MORE_DOCS`, the `docID()` method could return an old doc ID.\r\n\r\nSince the bug is a violation of a lower-level Lucene contract, there may be other situations where the query fails other than the one above.","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
