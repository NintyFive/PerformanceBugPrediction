The `DeprecationHandler` is part of the `elasticsearch-x-content` jar and is correctly contained in it in 7.4.2. Since this is a build related question, I would like to kindly ask you to use our  support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/563122752","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49848#issuecomment-563122752","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49848","id":563122752,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzEyMjc1Mg==","user":{"login":"athlan","id":2697638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTc2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2697638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/athlan","html_url":"https://github.com/athlan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/athlan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/athlan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/athlan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/athlan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/athlan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/athlan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/athlan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/athlan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/athlan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T08:33:18Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T08:33:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sure, finally after using debug option I figured out that Spring Boot dependencies overrides version downgrading it.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/eb0eb492b4a12d12955e77f2d94492405ce4c076/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-dependencies/pom.xml#L2151-L2154","performed_via_github_app":null}]
