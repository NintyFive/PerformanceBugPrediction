When this happens I have the option to try and track down the failed slices and retry those using Manual Slicing. But this is not ideal since it requires manual effort and is error prone. Alternatively if lots failed I may end up preferring to just retry the entire reindex.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if the Reindex API supported a few more options. For example `retries` to specify the number of times to retry a failed slice. If it's difficult to tell the difference between transient errors and other errors you could also make it required for the user to specify the `retry_errors` that should be allowed to retry and anything else should be considered a permanent failure.","closed_by":{"login":"henningandersen","id":33268011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjY4MDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/33268011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen","html_url":"https://github.com/henningandersen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
