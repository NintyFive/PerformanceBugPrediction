The type in your mappings is \"frameaccess\", but logstash defaults to a type of \"logs\", and we see this in the request debugging info printed:\n`[frameaccess-2015.09.28]`**`[logs]`**`[AVF9YT5FPii72JEyi-z9]`\n\nI think you should be using logstash to manage your templates? If you have problems with that, please open an issue with logstash.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
