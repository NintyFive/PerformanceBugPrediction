We should move to using `_field_caps` for determining potential mapping types\r\n * We also do validations around the source index existing or not. These will not work with a remote index as those indices are not in the cluster state. It may be beneficial to not verify index existence and simply rely on `_field_caps` to make sure all the fields that the user wants to pivot on and aggregate exist and are aggregatable.\r\n * Validations around permissions against remote indices should be skipped as well. Only the privileges that exist on the remote cluster are the ones that matter, and there is no good way to determine that outside of just trying to search against the index.\r\n\r\nThe searching, aggregation, etc. should all \"just work\" once the data frame transform is running. \r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"hendrikmuhs","id":7126422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7126422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrikmuhs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
