The things it offers access too, the `Settings` instance\r\nfor the entire server and a logger are nice to have around, but not\r\nreally needed *everywhere*.\r\n\r\nSo we should remove it and everything that needs a logger or a deprecation logger or a settings instance should just declare that it needs it.
