Changing GC or its parameters is not going to be useful in this condition, you simply need to add more memory or revise your queries. Changing garbage collector to G1GC might actually make situation worse. We heard many reports of G1GC-related JVM crashes.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/43000078","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6132#issuecomment-43000078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6132","id":43000078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDAwMDc4","user":{"login":"KlavsKlavsen","id":2737885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mzc4ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2737885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlavsKlavsen","html_url":"https://github.com/KlavsKlavsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlavsKlavsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlavsKlavsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlavsKlavsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlavsKlavsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlavsKlavsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlavsKlavsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlavsKlavsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlavsKlavsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KlavsKlavsen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-13T19:21:54Z","updated_at":"2014-05-13T19:21:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'll try to find some tool, that can pull out the JVM numbers, and put them into graphite..
