Same error. Which is expected.\n- starting with `bin/elasticsearch -Des.network.host=_local_` gave the same result. Bound to `127.0.0.1`. Expected in 2.0.\n- starting with `bin/elasticsearch -Des.network.host=_eth0_` (private IP): Bound to `10.240.0.3`. Accessible from outside because of the firewall route we did open previously.\n\nNote that using `_gce_` with the plugin is equivalent of using `_eth0_` here.\n\nWhat does it mean? It means that it will be unsecured to automatically bound to `_gce_` or `_eth0_` by default.\n\nIf users want to create a cluster of private nodes they will have to:\n- define `network.host: _gce_` for example\n- install `discovery-gce` plugin so they will get automatic node detection within the project\n\nIf they want to open one or all of their instances to the public, they will need to be extremely careful with that and probably add restrictions on which machines are really accessible on port 9200. By default, GCE firewall open the port for all machines which have a public IP, and by default all machines have a public IP.\n\nConclusion: let's close this ticket and the same tickets for azure and ec2 plugins as they should not have another behavior than the default elasticsearch behavior.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
