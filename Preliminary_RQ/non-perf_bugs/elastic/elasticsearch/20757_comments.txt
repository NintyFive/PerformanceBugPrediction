for the next people that might be confused as me, I want to leave the following hint. \r\n\r\nI wondered to see the `bucket_count` parameter for the `min_hash` filter, despite the official wiki says nothing about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash\r\n\r\nI found the clue here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-6968?focusedCommentId=15263867&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15263867\r\n\r\n> After a bit more digging, the single hash and keeping the minimum set can be improved.\r\n> \r\n> See: \r\n> [1] http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/shrivastava14.pdf\r\n> [2] http://www.auai.org/uai2014/proceedings/individuals/225.pdf\r\n> \r\n> In summary: rather than keep the minimum set, split the hash space up into 500 buckets (for a 500 hash fingerprint) and keep the minimum for each bucket. To fill an empty bucket, take the minimum from the next non-empty bucket on the right with rotation.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
