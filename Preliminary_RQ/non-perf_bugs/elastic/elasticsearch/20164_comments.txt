Let me reproduce the steps I took and the outcome I'd expect, maybe that helps.\n\nI'm trying to create a demo Maven project, to build and run the [demo code](https://github.com/cbuescher/elasticsearch/commit/ed944e89bc82ee7bd3197fb659e753b21a5b8c06). To try that out locally I would like to make the [rank-eval jar](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/feature/rank-eval/modules/rank-eval) available in my local maven repository.\n\nAccording to our [maven/gradle cheatsheet](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/GRADLE.CHEATSHEET) getting this done should be as simple as executing `gradle install`. Doing so in the module `rank-eval` (and for that matter also in `reindex`) leads me to the following output on the command line:\n\n```\n:modules:reindex:signArchives SKIPPED\n:modules:reindex:install SKIPPED\n\n\nSkipping task ':modules:reindex:install' as task onlyIf is false.\n:modules:reindex:install SKIPPED\n```\n\nI added `hasClientJar = true` to the `esplugin` section of build.gradle but get the same behaviour as above.\n\n@rjernst @martijnvg any ideas where I took the wrong turn? (Telling me to just do away with the Java code and build the example in Python would be ok as well, I just want to make sure I don't go down this path just because I missed a small detail.)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/243910099","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20164#issuecomment-243910099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20164","id":243910099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzkxMDA5OQ==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-31T21:36:00Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T21:36:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@MaineC using `gradle install` is the \"old\" way.
