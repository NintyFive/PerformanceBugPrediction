The details of how such quotas work and how to query them are specific to each filesystem implementation, and there is no provision within the JVM to read them. This is unfortunate, as it means that when Elasticsearch calculates e.g. the percentage of available disk space when applying watermarks, it does so based on the entire disk's free space, not the free space that is actually available to Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nJava allows the default file system implementation to be overridden using the property `java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider`. Elasticsearch could install a custom implementation that can account for filesystem quotas. Since the details of quota provision are completely outside the scope of Elasticsearch, this custom implementation would only provide an interface to communicate the quota and current disk usage. It would not contain logic for actually fetching this information.\r\n\r\nWe intend to make these changes for 6.8.x, 7.x (some future 7.x minor release), and master (8.0).","closed_by":{"login":"pugnascotia","id":8696382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTYzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8696382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia","html_url":"https://github.com/pugnascotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
