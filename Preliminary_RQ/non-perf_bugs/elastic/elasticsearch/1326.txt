If it is not stored, it will read from the `source`, and thus be in the same format as the `source`. If it is `stored`, it will read from the stored field and cast it to the default date format.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n$ curl http://localhost:9200/test/test/_mapping?pretty=true\n{\n  \"test\" : {\n    \"properties\" : {\n      \"created_at2\" : {\n        \"store\" : \"yes\",\n        \"format\" : \"dateOptionalTime\",\n        \"type\" : \"date\"\n      },\n      \"created_at\" : {\n        \"format\" : \"dateOptionalTime\",\n        \"type\" : \"date\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n$ curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/test/test/1 -d '{\"created_at\":1315847893000,\"created_at2\":1315847893000}'\n{\"ok\":true,\"_index\":\"test\",\"_type\":\"test\",\"_id\":\"1\",\"_version\":1}\n\n\n$ curl 'http://localhost:9200/test/test/_search?fields=created_at,created_at2&pretty=true'\n{\n  \"took\" : 2,\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\n  \"_shards\" : {\n    \"total\" : 5,\n    \"successful\" : 5,\n    \"failed\" : 0\n  },\n  \"hits\" : {\n    \"total\" : 1,\n    \"max_score\" : 1.0,\n    \"hits\" : [ {\n      \"_index\" : \"test\",\n      \"_type\" : \"test\",\n      \"_id\" : \"1\",\n      \"_score\" : 1.0,\n      \"fields\" : {\n        \"created_at\" : 1315847893000,\n        \"created_at2\" : \"2011-09-12T17:18:13.000Z\"\n      }\n    } ]\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
