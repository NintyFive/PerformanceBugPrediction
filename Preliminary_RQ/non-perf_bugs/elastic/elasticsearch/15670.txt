Here , either of the function like the script_score function can eat up all the influence of the score. That is the value of the script_score might be in range of 1000 to 2000 and value of the decay would be between 0 and 1. Hence the influence of the decay function is not exactly passed on to the final score , rather its the script_score that eats up all the influence , rest of the functions might have little or no influence on the final score. \n\nTo fix this , it might be useful to have a influenceScore factor per function which tells what percentage of the end score , this function should influence.\nFor eg: , the above query can be rewriten as\n\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"function_score\": {\n      \"functions\": [\n        {\n          \"influenceScore\": \"40%\",\n          \"decay\": {\n            \"gauss\": {\n              \"date\": {\n                \"origin\": \"2013-09-17\",\n                \"scale\": \"10d\",\n                \"offset\": \"5d\",\n                \"decay\": 0.5\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"influenceScore\": \"30%\",\n          \"field_value_factor\": {\n            \"field\": \"popularity\",\n            \"factor\": 1.2,\n            \"modifier\": \"sqrt\",\n            \"missing\": 1\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"influenceScore\": \"10%\",\n          \"random_score\": {}\n        },\n        {\n          \"influenceScore\": \"20%\",\n          \"script_score\": {\n            \"script\": {\n              \"lang\": \"lang\",\n              \"params\": {\n                \"param1\": 2,\n                \"param2\": 3\n              },\n              \"inline\": \"_score * doc['rating'].value / pow(param1, param2)\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere , we will have a influenceScore per function which dictates the influence of each function. This will help us in further fine tuning the score.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
