This is done so that we don't need to perform all the combinations (contextA + contextB and contextA + contextC, ....) and avoid the combinatorial explosion. Since all contexts are indexed individually it is difficult to add a boolean logic to match this context especially considering that we match each suggestion in the order of their weights. Matching with a `must` can degrade the performance considerably so I am going to close this issue, speeds really matter here and the suggester cannot be as flexible as a real index. When more flexibility is needed on the query side it is preferable to use a normal field and to apply edge ngram on it so that a prefix query can be mixed with another filter targeting a different field.
