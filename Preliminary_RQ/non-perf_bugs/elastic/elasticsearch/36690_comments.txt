For questions like these, could you please head over to our [discussion forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/beats/) where we can provide better support.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this ticket, but there's an active community on the forums, and I'm sure someone will be able to answer your question.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
