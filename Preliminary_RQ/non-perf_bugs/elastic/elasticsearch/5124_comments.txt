To me, resource loading for analyzers only from file system is not acceptable either. My suggestion is to follow the `.scripts` index idea, by extending it to an analyzer provisioning API for an internal `.analyzer` index, making use of the `ResourceWatcher` API.  The `ResourceWatcher` could be extended into an implementation that checks for`.analyzer` index modifications each minute or so. \nUsing the `AnalysisModule` extension points from a plugin, it could be possible to register new dynamically configurable versions of tokenizers/filters/analyzers, turning some of them who read configs from file into ones that are also `ResourceWatcher` aware.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/50141141","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5124#issuecomment-50141141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5124","id":50141141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTQxMTQx","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T12:15:11Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T12:15:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jprante then you have dependency issues.  an index that uses an analyzer that depends on a file stored in another index can only be recovered after that index has recovered...\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/50141821","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5124#issuecomment-50141821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5124","id":50141821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTQxODIx","user":{"login":"synhershko","id":212252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/212252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko","html_url":"https://github.com/synhershko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T12:22:59Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T12:22:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@clintongormley exactly why I said I don't like the store-in-an-index approach, I'm sure there can be better solutions.
