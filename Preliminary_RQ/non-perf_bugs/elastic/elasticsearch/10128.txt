In the cluster, every index had 5 shards and 1 replicas. Now, we set the number of replicas to zero and restarted the node. The problem is that the \"replica shards\" remain unassigned. How can we delete these shards? They cannot be reassigned, because there is only a single node left...\n\nGreetings,\nMarco\n","closed_by":{"login":"misterunknown","id":3264829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjQ4Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3264829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterunknown","html_url":"https://github.com/misterunknown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterunknown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterunknown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterunknown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterunknown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterunknown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterunknown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterunknown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterunknown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misterunknown/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
