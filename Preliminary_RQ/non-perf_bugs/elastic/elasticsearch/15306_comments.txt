I think we should also add this back again on 2.x since the original move to the top-level of the query seems incidental. @javanna wdyt?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/163930558","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15306#issuecomment-163930558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15306","id":163930558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzkzMDU1OA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-11T12:53:54Z","updated_at":"2015-12-11T12:54:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed it's weird to have back compat on master that does not exist on 2.x.
