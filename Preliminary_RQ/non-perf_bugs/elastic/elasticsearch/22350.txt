For instance for the value \"6.98\" with a scaling factor of 10 the bucket \"6.9\" should be used.\r\nCurrently the aggregations use the long value of the scaled float to compute the buckets. So instead of \"6.9\" the created bucket is \"6\". \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n````\r\nPUT t \r\n{\r\n   \"mappings\": {\r\n      \"t\": {\r\n         \"properties\": {\r\n            \"ctMultiplier\": {\r\n               \"scaling_factor\": 10,\r\n               \"type\": \"scaled_float\",\r\n               \"store\": true\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\nPOST t/t/1\r\n{\r\n    \"ctMultiplier\": \"6.8\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nPOST t/t/2\r\n{\r\n    \"ctMultiplier\": \"6.9\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nGET _search\r\n{\r\n    \"size\": 0,\r\n    \"aggs\": {\r\n        \"t\": {\r\n            \"terms\": {\r\n                \"field\": \"ctMultiplier\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n`````\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
