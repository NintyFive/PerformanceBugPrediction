There is data from multiple tables so there are same id's across various tables. I am unable to use different types anymore since mapping type is deprecated in 6.0.0 \r\n\r\nThe the other reason I need those Ids to be generated by ElasticSearch is because I am going to use ElasticSearch not only as search engine but as the main database for the project. MySQL tables are going to be removed. Project is based on data aggregation from various APIs and later on the new data will be aded directly to the ElasticSearch. So the ids from MySQL will be numeric values while new ones will have them as hashes. I wan't all of the documents to have id's in same format.\r\n\r\nAbout the responses coming in order.

Our reasoning for not accepting these requests is because that context can be held client side already (for example, in the capture of an asynchronous callback). Additionally, with this way, you can structure the context however you like, and we are not subject to a myriad of requests to format it for specific use cases. I still think this is the right way to handle this, as opposed to passing it around in requests and waiting for it to come back in responses.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/440637925","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/35739#issuecomment-440637925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/35739","id":440637925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDYzNzkyNQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-21T11:56:32Z","updated_at":"2018-11-21T11:56:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Additionally, a goal we have is to (within other constraints) keep APIs small and accepting this request runs counter to that.
