So any term with count > 1 should _always_ be listed before terms with count = 1.\n\nWhat you can see in this example is the result of how Elastic Search implements term facets internally. In fact it is a compromise between accuracy of distributed calculation and efficiency. Note that if you run this example on a single shard index (change `number_of_shards` to 1 in the template) then you get correct result.\n\nAs of now there is probably not a simple general solution. I wonder if other distributed systems can handle this type of calculation correctly in such extreme case like in this example without significant performance penalty.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
