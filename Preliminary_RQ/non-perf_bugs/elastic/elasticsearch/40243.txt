request:\r\nAccording to [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/store-compression-in-lucene-and-elasticsearch) it's possible to set `index.codec` on the node level, so you can move shards onto a node with a different setting **and** when you call `_optimize`, it will be rewritten with the new codec.\r\n\r\nThe post doesn't mention any other restrictions (like you can't write to the shard which is written with a different codec than the node setting), so I guess Lucene handles just fine if you have a mixed setting (ie you have segments written with different codecs).\r\nIf that's true, I guess setting `index.codec` should be a dynamic setting, so this should work:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/events_20190318/_settings' -d '{\"index.codec\": \"best_compression\"}'\r\n{\r\n  \"error\" : {\r\n    \"root_cause\" : [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\" : \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n        \"reason\" : \"Can't update non dynamic settings [[index.codec]] for open indices [[events_20190318/pWT4l08MS52Mw4JyW7rbnQ]]\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"type\" : \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n    \"reason\" : \"Can't update

possible to rewrite \"cold\" indices with a better compression, but without the need to dedicate complete nodes with a different `index.codec` setting.","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
