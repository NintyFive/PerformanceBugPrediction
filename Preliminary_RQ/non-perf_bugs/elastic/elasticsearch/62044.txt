The high-level client should automatically benefit from this feature.\r\n\r\nCompressing the request body should be driven by adding the corresponding header on `RequestOptions`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nRequestOptions gzipOptions = RequestOptions.DEFAULT.toBuilder().addHeader(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\").build();\r\nesClient.search(new SearchRequest(\"foo\"), gzipOptions);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also add a more convenient `RequestOption.compress(true)` but ultimately that will set the header option as illustrated above, since that header can always be set directly.","closed_by":{"login":"swallez","id":213730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzczMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/213730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swallez","html_url":"https://github.com/swallez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swallez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swallez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swallez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swallez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swallez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swallez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swallez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swallez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swallez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
