I don't think there is need for another API here.\r\nResponse from `getAlias` is consistent with REST API and returns easy-to-work-with `Map`. \r\nIf we need reverted relation (map alias-> set of indices, as alias can point to multiple indices) we can use something like:\r\n```java\r\nMap<String, Set<String>> getAliasesMap(GetAliasesResponse response) {\r\n    return response.getAliases().entrySet().stream()\r\n        .flatMap(e -> e.getValue().stream().map(v -> new Tuple<>(v.getAlias(), e.getKey())))\r\n        .collect(groupingBy(Tuple::v1, mapping(Tuple::v2, toSet())));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI'll close this issue for now, feel free to reopen if the problem still persists in HLRC","performed_via_github_app":null}]
