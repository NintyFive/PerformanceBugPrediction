I recently moved to 5.2.2 and noticed a failing test case.  The query that is now failing should only return a single result, but it is now returning two results, one of which has a score of 0.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1.  Index two contacts with no overlapping information\r\n 2.  Query for \"adam postman\"\r\n 3.  Two results returned, one with a score of 0\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\nI've uploaded the mapping and query definitions along with the actual results (included raw source) to https://gist.github.com/billscheidel/f28c87d236684a351d79bb2db9d46fbb.
