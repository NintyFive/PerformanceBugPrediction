First, as David mentioned earlier, you should not be setting the signer type. It is a setting that was meant for connecting to s3 compatible apis, which used legacy signing algorithms.  Second, if you still get a signature mismatch when removing the signer type, then you need to double check your access/secret keys. Try using those keys with something like the AWS cli, to see if you can write a key to the bucket in question.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue.
