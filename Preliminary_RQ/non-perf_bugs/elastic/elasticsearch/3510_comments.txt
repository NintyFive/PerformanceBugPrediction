There's a good chance that the bug is in your code and I really don't want to have to debug a language I don't know :)\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/22638632","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3510#issuecomment-22638632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3510","id":22638632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjM4NjMy","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-14T14:17:58Z","updated_at":"2013-08-14T14:17:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ok this is a wild guess since I am not a ruby guy either but I assume that you are relying on token positions since you use phrase prefix. can you try to create your ngram filter with `\"version\" : \"4.2\"` and test again. I assume this should fix the issue. If it does I need to think how we can work around that since the way how NGrams work in `0.90.3` is quite different.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/51607716","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3510#issuecomment-51607716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3510","id":51607716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjA3NzE2","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T14:17:25Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T14:17:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No update in a year.
