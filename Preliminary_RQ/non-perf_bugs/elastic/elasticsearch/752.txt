There are two main types, one that extends `AbstractExecutableScript` and one that exetends `AbstractSearchScript` (probably the one most users will extend).\n\nRegistering them can either be done by settings, for example: `scripts.natives.my.type` set to `sample.MyNativeScriptFactory` will register a script named `my`. Another option is in a plugin, to get `ScriptModule` and call `registerScript` on it.\n\nExecuting the script is done by specifying the type as `native`, and the name of the script as the script.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
