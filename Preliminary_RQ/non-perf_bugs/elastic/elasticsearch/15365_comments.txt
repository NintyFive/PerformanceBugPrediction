We can bucket many of them into categories, e.g. \"Access Java internals\", \"Modify JVM-wide settings\", \"Violate system boundaries\", and so on.\n\nMore and more like android every day.... Its a good idea.\n\nDo we trust plugins to define these buckets themselves in a config file or something or should just just all live in core and when we don't recognize one we bounce the user to Oracle's docs? I think the latter? I'd prefer to give users cryptic but exact permissions rather than allow a malicious plugin to tuck a permission away somewhere were it shouldn't.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/163634160","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15365#issuecomment-163634160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15365","id":163634160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzYzNDE2MA==","user":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-10T14:25:22Z","updated_at":"2015-12-10T14:25:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm only recommending changing plugin manager's output.
