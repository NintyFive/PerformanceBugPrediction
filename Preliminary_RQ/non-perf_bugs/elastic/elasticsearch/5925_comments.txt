We're already  using shard allocation awareness to ensure that nodes do not end up on the same VM host machine. We also use shard allocation filtering to pin indices to nodes. \n\nThis request is adding another dimension at search time to target only hosts that match a specific regex. Since I created this issue about 12 months ago, I have found a work around at the cost of latency. I basically run a search shards request to figure which nodes the shards I need to query are on and then determine which one of them matches my regex for host name pattern (different regex pattern for different applications). Then use matching node-id with search preference when sending the actual search query to ES. \n\n> On Apr 10, 2015, at 1:23 PM, Lee Hinman notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> @ppat I think this is the same issue as #10229, which can be solved by using shard allocation awareness, in that case, ES will automatically try to limit search responses within a particular awareness attribute.\n> \n> Hopefully this solves this issue, let me know if we correctly understood your issue.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/92302802","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5925#issuecomment-92302802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5925","id":92302802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyMzAyODAy","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-13T10:31:37Z","updated_at":"2015-04-13T10:31:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I like this idea.
