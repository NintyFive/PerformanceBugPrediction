There is a good suggestion in the PR to document the settings that are passed through to the tribe node clients, settings that are no longer allowed in the tribe client configurations, and settings that can be overridden in the tribe client's configuration.  But it doesn't look like this has been documented yet.  The following is what I have gathered - not sure if it's 100% correct. \n\nPassthroughs from ES node:\n- node.name\n- network.host\n- network.bind_host\n- network.publish_host\n- transport.host\n- transport.bind_host\n- transport.publish_host\n- path.home\n- path.conf\n- path.plugins\n- path.logs\n- path.scripts\n- shield.\\* (for those using Shield)\n\nSettings no longer allowed for the tribe clients (eg. t1, t2, etc..):\n- path.*\n\nSettings that are allowed for tribe clients (can override):\n- network.host\n- network.bind_host\n- network.publish_host\n- transport.host\n- transport.bind_host\n- transport.publish_host\n- cluster.name\n- discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts\n\nWill be helpful to document this (or similar) for tribe node users.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
