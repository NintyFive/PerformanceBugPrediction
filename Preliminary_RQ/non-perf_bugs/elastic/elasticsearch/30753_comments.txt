The first line looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\nDELETE /<indices to delete> HTTP/1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I suspect it is the list of indices that is entirely too long. First, I would consider this to be a curator bug and I think that you should open an issue on the Curator [issue tracker](https://github.com/elastic/curator). Secondly, you can work around this by finding out how long that initial line length is that Curator is exceeding and then you can set `http.max_initial_line_length` and restart Elasticsearch (the default is 4 KiB).\r\n\r\nGiven that I do not think this is an Elasticsearch bug, I am going to close this as we reserve GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
