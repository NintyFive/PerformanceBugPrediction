I can't visit it neither in Company nor in my home.so I post my question herer.\n2. since type is a logical concept and in Lucene index, it is only a indexed field. why conceptial bounding it with index? I asked because many users tend to index all kinds of data into one index and fetch it by id, which is time cost comparing with put data into diffierent index.\n3. I'd like to comfirm one thing: if I have different data types and I used es as a key value store and fetch data with ids. I can improve performance by split one index into many index according to data type. but I don't get what I pay for this improvement. \n   please answer my question or give me some resource to understand it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
