At least for the lower bound of a text or keyword field I would assume ever value being larger than the empty string. The problem with this edge case is that the empty string should be considered an open lower bound that matches everything. This works as expected for \"inclusice\" lower bound (i.e. \"gte\") but not for \"exclusive\" (i.e. \"gt\") because its not completely clear which term to exclude. Internally we use Lucenes TermRangeQuery which does the right thing for \"null\" values here implicitely sets the inclusion flag to \"true\" in this case (see https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/TermRangeQuery.java#L52 and https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/TermRangeQuery.java#L81).\r\nI think we should treat the empty string in the same way when constructing the range query and implicitely change the inclusion flag in this case to avoid this confusion.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/713522244","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/63386#issuecomment-713522244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/63386","id":713522244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMzUyMjI0NA==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-21T12:08:19Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T12:08:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Should be fixed in 7.11.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
