Usually users are interested only in their 'team' data.  Currently, some users execute query using Kibana w/o specifying index and field name(it takes _all').   Such queries at times, bring our cluster to halt/ crash etc.  I would like queries to be restricted such that only well defined queries can be executed on ES.  A well defined query is a query which specifies index and field name.  I could not find a server level config param to enforce such constraint on user queries.  I posted question on ES forum but did not get a clear answer.\n\nThis bug/ ER filed to have ES server level parameter such as to enforce user defined queries to have index name and/ or field name specified.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
