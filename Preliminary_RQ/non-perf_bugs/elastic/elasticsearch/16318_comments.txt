They do not hang but rather just take to long to complete. The only thing that sticks out is that the cluster state update contains mapping for two types at once. I tried to simulated this using a count down latch in the MetaDataMappingService, causing batching of types but to no avail, it doesn't reproduce. I suggest we wait and see if this failures comes back and try to get more information. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/178630237","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16318#issuecomment-178630237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16318","id":178630237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3ODYzMDIzNw==","user":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-02T15:22:02Z","updated_at":"2016-02-02T15:22:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry for the delay, been traveling + internet issues.
