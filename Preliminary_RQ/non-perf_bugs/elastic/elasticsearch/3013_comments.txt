My other pull request is a feature request that probably only affects myself and I have a workaround, so there is no urgency. \n\nIronically, I have been a strong advocate of switching to a DVCS here at work (preferably git, but I would accept bzr or mercurial) in order to get lightweight branching, and here I am not using branches properly! I will clean up my fork and submit another pull request with proper branches. Working on some other features as well.\n\nAs far as this issue goes, my commit used default values that helped thesuaves22's issue (from the mailing list), but are probably incorrect for general usage. I will match Solr's factory's handling of the args and submit a fix. Once that is submitted, I can add the filter to the docs as well.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
