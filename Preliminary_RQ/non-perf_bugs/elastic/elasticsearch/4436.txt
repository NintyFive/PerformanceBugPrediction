Unavailable refers to indices that don't exist or are closed. \n- `expand_wildcards` - Controls what kind of indices should be expanded with wildcard expressions. If `open` is specified a wildcard expression expands only into open indices and if `closed` is specified a wildcard expression only expands into closed indices. The latter only makes sense in the close index api, which it will default to.\n- `allow_no_indices` - Controls whether it is allowed that a wildcard expression expands  into zero concrete indices. This option also applies when `_all` or no index has been specified.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
