That eats up a lot of memory in index space.\n\nSo I'd like to be able to merge older indexes into larger indexes.. with the new reindex api and alias'es - thats easy.\n\nOnly issue left, is that kibana will still search on every daily index.. even though they would now be an alias for the same weekly (or monthly) index.. meaning I would get 30 searches run on the same index.. instead of just 1.. I asked on irc and Warkholm stated that ES does not in fact recognize when this happens..\n\nI would like ES to actually detect this fact, when searching on aliases.. so 30 searches are merged into one in this case :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
