One ask: it would be nice to have the qa/third-party tests work \"normally\" so we know eg the rest test files work, and \"swap out\" the fixture for the real service when running the test when credentials/etc are passed in. Your idea to use the rest tests from the plugin itself sound good, but I worry the setup of the test in gradle would be left untested until we actually pass in the credentials. What if the fixture based tests were all under qa/third-party?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/378530566","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29349#issuecomment-378530566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29349","id":378530566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODUzMDU2Ng==","user":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-04T08:58:36Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T08:58:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @rjernst, that's the feedback I wanted.
