assumption, that array is a datatype.\r\nBut not really this is the case, so the title should be more like the title \"Array handling\".\r\nIdeally this could be backported to 6.x versions as well?\r\n\r\nSo potentially at least here\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/text.html\r\nand here\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/number.html\r\nshould be a reference, that potentially these can become an array as well.\r\n\r\nIn theory it could point to the page:\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/array.html\r\nand what is written there under:\r\nMulti-value fields and the inverted index\r\nIf that heading still had an anchorpoint, a direct link would be possible.","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
