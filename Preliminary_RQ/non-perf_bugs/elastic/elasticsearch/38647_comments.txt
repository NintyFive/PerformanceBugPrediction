The issue here is that you have set the alias setting to tell ILM which alias to use, but have not created the alias. You should create the index with the setting:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"aliases\": {\r\n  \"prod-zgapplication\":{\r\n    \"is_write_index\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the future, please use https://discuss.elastic.co for issues like this!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
