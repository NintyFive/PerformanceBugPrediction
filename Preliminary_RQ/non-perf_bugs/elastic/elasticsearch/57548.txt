For users, the list of options can be a bit overwhelming and hard to navigate.\r\n\r\nTo help address this, we could reorganize the reference on field types:\r\n* Instead of the sections 'core', 'complex', and 'specialized', they could be grouped more by use case. For example there would be a 'full-text search' section that contains `text`, `completion`, and `search_as_you_type`, etc.\r\n* We could add a ['how to' page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/how-to.html) on choosing the right mappings. The assumption is that the user has already played around with Elasticsearch with all data mapped dynamically, and now wants to design the right schema.\r\n\r\nOther suggestions are very welcome!","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
