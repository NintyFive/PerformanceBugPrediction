This seems to affect Kibana's ability to properly discover the mapping.\n\nI have a feeling this is to do with the change not allowing mapping options for metafields like _type, _id etc.\n\nI have provided examples below using the mapping API against a pre 2.x index and a post 2.x index both running inside ES 2.1\n\nPre 2.x index\n/oldindex-2014.12.28/_mapping/logs/field/_type?include_defaults=true\n\n```\n{\n  \"oldindex-2014.12.28\": {\n    \"mappings\": {\n      \"logs\": {\n        \"_type\": {\n          \"full_name\": \"_type\",\n          \"mapping\": {\n            \"_type\": {\n              \"store\": false,\n              \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNew 2.x index:\n/newindex_2-2015.01.01/_mapping/logs/field/_type?include_defaults=true\n\n```\n{\n  \"newindex_2-2015.01.01\": {\n    \"mappings\": {\n      \"logs\": {\n        \"_type\": {\n          \"full_name\": \"_type\",\n          \"mapping\": {\n\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
