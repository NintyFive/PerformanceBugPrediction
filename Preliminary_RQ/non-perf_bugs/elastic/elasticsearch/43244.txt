But folks also talk about `Relocating` and `Unavailable`. Are their statuses on their own or do they fall under `Unassigned`’? Also, are there any other that I am missing?\r\nResponse:\r\nNhat Nguyen  [4 minutes ago]\r\n@Cristina A shard copy can be in one of these four states: unassigned, initializing, started and relocating. I think people call “unavailable” for “unassigned” but we prefer using  “unassigned”. A relocating shard is a started shard but is being relocated to another node.","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
