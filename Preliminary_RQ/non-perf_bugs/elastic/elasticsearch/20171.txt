If they don't supply it, then it doesn't exist. If they do supply it, then it exists as whatever value they set (regardless of what might have been there before!). The version will exist solely as a mechanism for client software to ensure that not only is their template or pipeline there, but it's the one that they submitted last time without having to go field-by-field.\n\nThis allows requests like this to be submitted:\n\n``` http\nGET /_template/.monitoring-es-2?filter_path=*.version\n```\n\nThen, the client can loop through the returned templates and only concern itself with the `name` and `version`. Pipelines would have an equivalent look:\n\n``` http\nGET /_ingest/pipelines/.monitoring*?filter_path=*.version\n```\n- [x] Templates #20353\n- [x] Pipelines #20343\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
