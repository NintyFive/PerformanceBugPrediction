Tokenizers convert strings into a stream of tokens.  Each token filter is then applied to the token stream in turn, adding, removing, or changing tokens in the stream.\n\nThere is an overlap between tokenizers and token filters (eg ngram tokenizer vs ngram token filter), so giving them completely different names would impede understanding instead of helping it. \n\nThe token filters name also fits nicely with the character filters name (they filter characters before tokenizing).\n\nNobody understands the analysis process until they read through the documentation to understand what happens in each part of the process, so I'm comfortable with keeping the current names and just relying on the explanations that we provide.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
