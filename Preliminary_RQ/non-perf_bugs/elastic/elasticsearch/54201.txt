Transform should do the same, this is also consistent with other aggregations, e.g. single value aggregations.\r\n\r\nBecause percentiles support for transforms has not been released, I label this as non-issue, technically it is a bug.","closed_by":{"login":"hendrikmuhs","id":7126422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7126422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrikmuhs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
