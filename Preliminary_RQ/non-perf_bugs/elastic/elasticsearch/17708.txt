The example below occurs on both elasticsearch-head and elasticsearch-kopf.\n\nI run `./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install mobz/elasticsearch-head`, and I got MalformedURLException: no protocol. It seems that elasticsearch-5.0.0-alpha1 asking for full URL.\n\nIf I supply another full URL to install: \n`./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head`\nI got this error message:\n`ERROR: `elasticsearch` directory is missing in the plugin zip`\n\nLooks like there are some changes in the elasticsearch plugin module. Is this a bug or expected behavior? Does the package require specific folder or specific stuffs to be compatible to elasticsearch-5.0.0-alpha1?\n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
