The cluster state is already compressed, so similarities in mappings across indexes shouldn't take up extra space there. As for sharing in memory, I think that might be a very large change (we don't have really anything shared _across_ indexes right now, afaik), and I'm not sure the memory savings really add up to anything significant, compared to the cost of having that many indexes (in which case, if that is a bottleneck, the user should probably create new indexes less often). Instead, something like @s1monw has suggested before, having the ability to collapse multiple indices into one for archiving, would be much better on performance.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/172843680","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12817#issuecomment-172843680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12817","id":172843680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Mjg0MzY4MA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T12:49:46Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T12:49:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another thought that came up in FixItFriday: HTTP compression should greatly reduce the amount of data being sent over the wire (given that there is so much repetition in the mappings).
