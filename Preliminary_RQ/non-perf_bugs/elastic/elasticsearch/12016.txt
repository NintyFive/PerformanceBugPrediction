The `nested`,  `has_child`, `has_parent`, `geo_*`, and `function_score` query throw exceptions, while all of the others match no docs instead.\n\nWe need to make the behaviour uniform across queries.  \n\nThe solution we came up with in FixItFriday is:\n- if a field doesn't exist in an index, then replace the query with a `FieldNotFound` query, which matches no documents\n- if `explain` is turned on, then the `field_not_found` query will be part of the output\n- if the `strict_mappings` is passed, then the request will throw a field not found exception instead.\n\nThis preserves the ease of use of, eg:\n\n```\nGET _search?name=john\n```\n\nwithout making search requests even more verbose, but makes debugging bad field names easy.\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
