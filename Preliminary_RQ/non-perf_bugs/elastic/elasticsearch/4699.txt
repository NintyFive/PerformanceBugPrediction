The reasons for this are:\n1. Removing stopwords on any string field by default can have surprising results, eg `country_code: \"NO\"` would be indexed with no value,  `title: \"To be or not to be\"` would similarly have all words removed.\n2. Stopwords do add value to search, and with tools like the `common` query, we can take stopwords into account while still keeping queries performing well.\n3. Choosing the English stopwords by default can be surprising for users whose primary language isn't English. \n\nHowever, there are two other non-language-specific analyzers which should have a similar treatment, specifically:\n- `pattern` analyzer \n- `standard_html` analyzer\n\nAlso, the change to the `standard` analyzer has not been documented, and the `standard_html` analyzer is not documented at all.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
