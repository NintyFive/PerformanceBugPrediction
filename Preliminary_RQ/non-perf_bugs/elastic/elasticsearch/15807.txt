They were trying to filter on a field in kibana with no success. Upon digging a bit deeper we found that his field was mapped as a long. When I tried to create a filter in kibana on that field, none of the results were filtered out. Kibana creates filters on long fields as phrase queries.\n\nTo see the issue input these commands into sense.\n\n```\nDELETE /xamox\n\nPOST /xamox\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"long_field\": {\n          \"type\": \"long\"\n        },\n        \"double_field\": {\n          \"type\": \"double\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPOST /xamox/test\n{\n  \"long_field\": 0.253388538525881,\n  \"double_field\": 0.253388538525881\n}\n\nPOST /xamox/test\n{\n  \"long_field\": 0.640691024131749,\n  \"double_field\": 0.640691024131749\n}\n\nPOST /xamox/test\n{\n  \"long_field\": 0.0878632360473135,\n  \"double_field\": 0.0878632360473135\n}\n\n#basic query\nGET /xamox/test/_search\n\n#phrase query on long\nPOST /xamox/test/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"long_field\": {\n        \"query\":0.640691024131749,\n        \"type\":\"phrase\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n#phrase query on double\nPOST /xamox/test/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"double_field\": {\n        \"query\":0.640691024131749,\n        \"type\":\"phrase\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
