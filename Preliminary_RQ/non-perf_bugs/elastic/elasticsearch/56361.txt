need to be able to inspect the number of API requests made to cloud backed snapshot repositories (S3, GCS, Azure).\r\nThis entails creating implementations of

time of writing this it only covers `GET` and `LIST` requests).\r\n\r\nThe existing code for metering S3 requests was implemented in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/55051.\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement the remaining request types (`PUT` and `POST`) in the all repositories (#56821,  #56826, #56936) \r\n- [x] Implement counting of requests by type for GCS
