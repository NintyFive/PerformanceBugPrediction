version**:  2.3.1\n\n**JVM version**: 1.8.0_66\n\n**OS version**: CentOS 7\n\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\nWhen a new index is auto-created (by indexing a document) using an index template, the setting `index.mapper.dynamic` is not honored: If the document has an unmapped type, it gets indexed nevertheless and the additional type is added to the index.\n\n_Expected result:_ The indexing operation should be rejected as dynamic mapping is disabled for the index created from the template.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n\nCreate template:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/test?pretty -d'\n{\n  \"template\": \"test_*\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"number_of_shards\": 1,\n    \"index.mapper.dynamic\": false\n  },\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"foo\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nIndex data that does not match the mapping:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9200/test_1/bar?pretty -d'\n{\n    \"abc\": \"def\"\n}'\n```\n\nNow, an index with an additional type \"bar\" has been created from the template, although dynamic mapping is set to false.\n\n```\ncurl -XGET localhost:9200/test_1?pretty\n{\n  \"test_1\" : {\n    \"aliases\" : { },\n    \"mappings\" : {\n      \"foo\" : {\n        \"properties\" : {\n          \"name\" : {\n            \"type\" : \"string\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"bar\" : {\n        \"properties\" : {\n          \"abc\" : {\n            \"type\" : \"string\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"settings\" : {\n      \"index\" : {\n        \"mapper\" : {\n          \"dynamic\" : \"false\"\n        },\n        \"creation_date\" : \"1460026755596\",\n        \"number_of_shards\" : \"1\",\n        \"number_of_replicas\" : \"1\",\n        \"uuid\" : \"EGWEI-iARECmY__EEa9jHg\",\n        \"version\" : {\n          \"created\" : \"2030199\"\n        }\n
