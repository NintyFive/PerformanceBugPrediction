Additionally, there are some prefixes (ex: `transport.tcp` in the `transport.tcp.compress` setting) that no longer make sense now that we have one transport type. We would like to transition these settings to be consistent based on the follow rules:\r\n\r\n1. The `network.` prefixed settings are settings that can apply to both `http` and `transport` settings. \r\n2. Elasticsearch internal transport settings are only prefixed by `transport.`. No more `transport.tcp`. \r\n3. The `tcp` prefix is reserved for settings that are a proxy for OS socket settings (ex: `tcp.no_delay`).\r\n\r\nHere is how this works out in practice:\r\n\r\nTop-level settings:\r\n\r\n`network.host`\r\n`transport.host` \r\n`http.host`\r\n\r\nThe `network.host` is the fallback setting option for both `http` and `transport` settings if their specific setting is not set.\r\n\r\nSocket option settings:\r\n\r\n`network.tcp.no_delay`\r\n`transport.tcp.no_delay`\r\n`transport.profiles.profile_name.tcp.no_delay`\r\n`http.tcp.no_delay`\r\n\r\nThe `network.tcp.no_delay` is the fallback setting option for both `http` and `transport` settings if their specific setting is not set. The `transport.tcp.no_delay` is the fallback for the profile level setting if the profile level setting is not set.\r\n\r\nWith these rules the follow settings needs to be deprecated and replaced:\r\n\r\n`transport.tcp.port` -> `transport.port`\r\n`transport.tcp.compress` -> `transport.compress`\r\n`transport.tcp.connect_timeout` -> `transport.connect_timeout`\r\n`transport.tcp_no_delay` -> `transport.tcp.no_delay`\r\n`transport.profiles._.tcp_no_delay` -> `transport.profiles._.tcp.no_delay`\r\n`transport.profiles._.tcp_keep_alive` -> `transport.profiles._.tcp.keep_alive`\r\n`transport.profiles._. reuse_address` -> `transport.profiles._. tcp.reuse_address`\r\n`transport.profiles._. send_buffer_size` -> `transport.profiles._. tcp.send_buffer_size`\r\n`transport.profiles._. receive_buffer_size` -> `transport.profiles._. tcp.receive_buffer_size`\r\n`http.tcp_no_delay` -> `http.tcp.no_delay`\r\n`network.tcp.connect_timeout` -> Completely remove. There are no connect timeouts for http.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add replacement settings and mark old settings for removal in code base (6.6, 7.0) #36623\r\n- [x] Update documentation to refer to the replacement settings (6.7, 7.0)\r\n- [x] Remove all \"string\" usages of old settings in codebase (8.0, 7.x) #40818\r\n- [x] Mark old settings as deprecated (8.0, 7.x) #40821\r\n- [x] Delete old settings from codebase (8.0)\r\n- [x] Add comment to breaking change docs (8.00","closed_by":{"login":"tbrooks8","id":862472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjQ3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/862472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrooks8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
