Fixing this requires manual intervention after each version change. Keeping these default values causes our Elasticsearch instance to crash after a while.\n\nWe're using the following configuration in /usr/lib/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service:\nLimitNOFILE=256000\nLimitMEMLOCK=infinity\n\nAfter an update, these values are replaced with the following:\nLimitNOFILE=65535\n# LimitMEMLOCK=infinity\n\nRepository path:\nelasticsearch/distribution/src/main/packaging/systemd/elasticsearch.service\n\nIs it supposed to be like this? Are we doing something wrong?\n\nThanks,\n\nRegards,\nRobert\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
