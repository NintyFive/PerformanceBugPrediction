I've isolated the minimum reproductible test case: https://gist.github.com/Lothiraldan/5488931.\n\nI create an index without specific settings named test.1.1 I set two aliases test.read and test.write to test.1.1.\n\nThen I get the index status of each alias (via localhost:9200/test.read/status) and extract the real index name behind alias (it's exactly how the python driver pyes does the job).\n\nThen I create a second one named test.1.2 I move the two aliases (test.read and test.write) to the freshly created index and try to do the same requests (get index status and extract real index name).\n\nOn elastic search 0.20.6, no problem. On elastic search 0.90, when I do the request, I get this result:\n\n{\n    \"_shards\": {\n        \"failed\": 0, \n        \"successful\": 0, \n        \"total\": 10\n    }, \n    \"indices\": {}, \n    \"ok\": true\n}\n\nIt looks like a timing issue, I tried to add a sleep in my python code but I must add a ~300ms minimum else my test will fail.\n\nI don't know if it's a bug or a desired behaviour, if someone can confirm the difference of output between the two version.\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
