Currently (without the fix) the `porter` and `porter2` stemmers map to the `porter` stemmer.  The `english` stemmer maps to the `porter2` stemmer.\n\nI also did a bit more investigation and I think the lovins stemmer may have a problem too. The proper output for the lovins stemmer is: 'consol', 'hi', 'knight', 'stay', however I remember getting something different.
