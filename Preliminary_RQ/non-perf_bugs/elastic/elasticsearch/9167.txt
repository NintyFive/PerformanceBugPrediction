One node is the ES master node without saving index shards; other three nodes are data nodes saving index shards. My tests are about applying decommissioning actions to one~two of the three data nodes, and check if index shards are removed from the decommissioned nodes.\n\nI installed ES 1.4.2 on ubuntu 14.04 by following the official guide: \nhttp://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-repositories.html\n\nInstalled ES version:\n\n> elasticsearch  -v \n> Version: 1.4.2, Build: 927caff/2014-12-16T14:11:12Z, JVM: 1.8.0_25\n\n// This cmd below decommissions data node1. \n// This cmd works.
