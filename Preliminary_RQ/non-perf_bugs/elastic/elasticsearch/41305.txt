When [evaluating the rule](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/x-pack/plugin/security/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/security/authc/support/UserRoleMapper.java#L196), this causes an `NPE` in `org.apache.lucene.util.automaton.CharacterRunAutomaton`\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced with a role mapping such as \r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"enabled\" : true,\r\n    \"roles\" : [\r\n      \"kibana_user\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"rules\" : {\r\n      \"field\" : {\r\n        \"dn\" : \"*,ou=finance,dc=somethign,dc=com\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"metadata\" : { }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand a i.e. SAML user in a realm that has no `attributes.dn` mapping rule in the configuration.
