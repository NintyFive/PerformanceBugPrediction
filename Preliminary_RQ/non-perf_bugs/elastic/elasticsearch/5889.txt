Maybe, when in update body there are both `doc_as_upsert` and `upsert`, Elasticsearch should merge the sent `doc` with the hashmap in `upsert`? That's what I actually tried to do, but ES in this case favors `doc_as_upsert` over `upsert` content.\n\nSo, basically something like this would be nice:\n\n```\n{\n  doc: {\n    field1: \"Lorem ipsum\"\n  },\n  doc_as_upsert: true,\n  upsert: {\n    additional_field1: 10\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCheers,\nd\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
