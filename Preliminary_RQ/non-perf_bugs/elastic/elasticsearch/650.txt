The new `filter` element within the search request can be used to accomplish it.\n\nFor example, lets create two tweets, with two different tags:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1' -d '\n{\n    \"message\" : \"something blue\",\n    \"tag\" : \"blue\"\n}\n'\n\ncurl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/2' -d '\n{\n    \"message\" : \"something green\",\n    \"tag\" : \"green\"\n}\n'\n\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_refresh'\n```\n\nWe can now search for `something`, and have a `terms` facet. \n\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/twitter/_search?pretty=true' -d '\n{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"term\" : { \"message\" : \"something\" }\n    },\n    \"facets\" : {\n        \"tag\" : {\n            \"terms\" : { \"field\" : \"tag\" }\n        }\n    }\n}\n'\n```\n\nWe get two hits, and the relevant facets with a count of `1` for both `green` and `blue`. Now, lets say the `green` facet is chosen, we can simply add a filter for it:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/twitter/_search?pretty=true' -d '\n{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"term\" : { \"message\" : \"something\" }\n    },\n    \"filter\" : {\n        \"term\" : { \"tag\" : \"green\" }\n    },\n    \"facets\" : {\n        \"tag\" : {\n            \"terms\" : { \"field\" : \"tag\" }\n        }\n    }\n}\n'\n```\n\nAnd now, we get only 1 hit back, but the facets remain the same.\n\nNote, if additional filters is required on specific facets, they can be added as a `facet_filter` to the relevant facets.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
