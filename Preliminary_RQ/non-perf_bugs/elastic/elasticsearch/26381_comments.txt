We will accept PRs against them subject to review & the usual requirements. The translations that I've added to the build this week were done by a vendor and reviewed by our own native speakers. We kept that process in separate, private repos so we could get the translation team ramped up & work out the kinks in the process out of public view. Going forward, the idea is to follow our normal process and have them submit PRs against the product repos.
