Any chance it'll be supported in 0.9GA?\n\nAlso may I ask if there is any hope to have terms_stats support total/count (if not the rest of stats) for \"missing\" and \"other\" like terms does? It would be very helpful. Right now I decompose my terms_stats to 3 facets, terms_stats, stats with missing filter and stats for that field to calculate \"complete\" totals (per term, other, missing) and then recompose results back. I also have few useful and simple ideas for new facets (\"logical\" facets I currently use by decomposing them onto multiple ES facets and recomposing data together) just not sure it is a good time to lobby for them
