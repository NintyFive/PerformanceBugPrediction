I understand the concern with the unwanted upgrade, but APT has a mechanism to prevent this sort of upgrade (pinning), without disrupting the expected (and documented) behavior of an APT repository. \n\nThe opposite happened: I was installing elasticsearch from a repo in sources.list.d and expecting that the latest package was installed, but as the repo line had the major version on it, I was installing a 0.9 version. It took a while to figure out that the problem was the elasticsearch version and not my queries.\n\nPlease consider the change.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/50648375","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6682#issuecomment-50648375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6682","id":50648375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjQ4Mzc1","user":{"login":"erikrose","id":295816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/295816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikrose","html_url":"https://github.com/erikrose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikrose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikrose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikrose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikrose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikrose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikrose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikrose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikrose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikrose/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-30T17:14:47Z","updated_at":"2014-07-30T17:14:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I recommend following the pattern set by postgresql, open-jdk, python, and most other Debian packages which have significant version-to-version differences: embed the important version information in the package name itself: for example, elasticsearch-1.2.
