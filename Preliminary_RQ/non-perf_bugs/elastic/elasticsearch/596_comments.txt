Internally it doesn't do more than getting the text of the document and using it with the MoreLikeThis query, which is something you can easily simulate in other searches to elasticsearch.\n\nAs to search in other sources, like google, we are working on a term vectors endpoint which will allow you to get the information about the individual words within the documents, their frequency etc. You will be able to use it to construct smart queries to outside sources. See: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/3115\n\nI'm closing this for now, if you feel these are not sufficient - please feel free to reopen and discuss.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
