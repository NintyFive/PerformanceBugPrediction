Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/624458168","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49039#issuecomment-624458168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49039","id":624458168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDQ1ODE2OA==","user":{"login":"zhuaizhuaixi","id":25663763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjYzNzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25663763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuaizhuaixi","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuaizhuaixi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuaizhuaixi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuaizhuaixi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuaizhuaixi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuaizhuaixi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuaizhuaixi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuaizhuaixi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuaizhuaixi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuaizhuaixi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuaizhuaixi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T06:03:20Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T06:03:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I face the same problem.\r\nI find [similar problem in https://discuss.elastic.co](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-search-resthighlevelclient-delaying-when-doing-simple-requests-to-es/204801/1)\r\nbut there is no response.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
