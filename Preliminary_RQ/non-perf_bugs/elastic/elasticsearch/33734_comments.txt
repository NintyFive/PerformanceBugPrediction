I think it's quite inflexible.\r\nI mean, I have nodes with multiple paths (both ssds and hdds) and some nodes have fewer, others have more, but all have more than one. By implementing the above, you just don't care, it will work seamlessly without the need to hardcode paths, the same way with node attributes, which is a very elegant and flexible way to allocate shards/indices to nodes.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/422824150","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33734#issuecomment-422824150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33734","id":422824150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjgyNDE1MA==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-19T14:24:56Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T14:24:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bra-fsn  I understand the need and indeed the custom path is a work around. Sadly managing allocation on the path level is something that requires a *lot* of work on the allocation layer - all of our code now has a shard to node mapping. I don't think we can realistically implement these kind of features any time in the foreseeable future. I'm going to close the issue to communicate that fact.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
