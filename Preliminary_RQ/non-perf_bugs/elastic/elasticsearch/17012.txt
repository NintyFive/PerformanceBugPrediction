Create a template with a PUT to `_template/reproducebug` and the following body (`date_detection: true` and `index:not_analyzed`):\n\n```\n{\n    \"template\": \"*\",\n    \"mappings\": {\n        \"_default_\": {\n            \"date_detection\": true,\n            \"_all\": {\n                \"enabled\": false\n            },\n            \"dynamic_templates\": [\n                {\n                    \"template1\": {\n                        \"mapping\": {\n                            \"index\": \"not_analyzed\",\n                            \"type\": \"{dynamic_type}\"\n                        },\n                        \"match\": \"*\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ],\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"msg\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"index\": \"analyzed\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n1. Index the following document, that contains a ISO8601 date: `{\"foo\":\"bar\", \"time\":\"2016-03-08T09:52:09.097Z\"}`\n2. Check that the field time is indexed as a not_analyzed string.\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\nNo relevant logs.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
