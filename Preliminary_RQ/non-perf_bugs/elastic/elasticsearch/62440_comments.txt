Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.\r\n\r\nIn your particular case I notice you are only using the ngram tokenizer for that field, which basically means after analysis you have 2- and 3-grams but the original token is lost. \r\nOne possible solution is to index into two fields (one e.g. using the standard analyzer or a language analyzer and one using the ngrams for fuzzy matching). Then query over both of them and adjust the boosts as needed. If you have further questions on this someone in the forums is sure able to help.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
