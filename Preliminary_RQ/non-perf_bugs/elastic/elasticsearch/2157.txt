a record contains a phrase with stop words in the middle  (`foo and bar`, for example) and the search expression contains a matching phrase, highlighter produces different results that depend on how the field was indexed. \n- If the field was indexed with `\"term_vector\": \"with_positions_offsets\"` elasticsearch doesn't highlight anything\n- if the field was indexed with `\"term_vector\": \"with_positions_offsets\"` and the field's analyzer has `\"enable_position_increments\": false`, elasticsearch highlights the entire phrase: `foo and bar`. \n- if the field was indexed without \"term_vector\" enabled elasticsearch highlights words `foo` and `bar` separately.\n\nFull repro can be found here: https://gist.github.com/3280061\n\nSolr seems to be behaving the same way: see https://gist.github.com/3279879#file_response_fvh.txt  and [SOLR-3724](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-3724)\n\nA possible workaround for us would be to add a flag on the highlighter query and globally that would disable fast vector highlighter. FVH is relatively new portion of lucene and this is already the second time when I wish I had a way to temporarily disable it without reindexing my data. (The first time was [LUCENE-3719](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3719).) I could submit a pull request if you think that would be a useful feature.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
