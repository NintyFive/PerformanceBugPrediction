This is the case when implementing \"index symlink\" behaviour. For example, when creating an index per month, it would be very convenient to perform the following:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_aliases' -d '\n{\n    \"actions\" : [\n        { \"remove\" : { \"index\" : \"*\", \"alias\" : \"current\" } },\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"august-2013\", \"alias\" : \"current\" } }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nThis prevents the application from having to find the previous current index, get the associated aliases, and perform the remove operation.\n\nAdditionally, it would be nice to remove all aliases from an index as well:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_aliases' -d '\n{\n    \"actions\" : [\n        { \"remove\" : { \"index\" : \"august-2013\", \"alias\" : \"*\" } }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nAnd of course, you should be able to combine them as well:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_aliases' -d '\n{\n    \"actions\" : [\n        { \"remove\" : { \"index\" : \"*\", \"alias\" : \"*\" } }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
