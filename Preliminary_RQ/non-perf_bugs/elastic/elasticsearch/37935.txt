To match what has been done for mappings in version 7 the default time format for ingest should be Java time, so that formats with and without an `8` prefix are treated identically.\r\n\r\nI opened #37934 to make this change (as I want to test that the ML file structure finder works with it in v7).  However, while making this change I found that changing the default for date processing in ingest also affects index naming with the date index name processor.  After a brief chat with @spinscale I am raising this issue for further discussion of whether extra measures need to be taken regarding index naming by the date index name processor through the 6.x -> 7.x upgrade.  I can imagine it might cause problems for Beats?\r\n\r\nRelates #27330","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
