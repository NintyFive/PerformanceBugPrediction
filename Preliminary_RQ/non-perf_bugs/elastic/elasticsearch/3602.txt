all SearchParseElement classes are implemented like this:\n\npublic class HighlighterParseElement implements SearchParseElement {\n   @Override\n       public void parse(XContentParser parser, SearchContext context) throws Exception {\n      // actual parsing logic\n      context.highlight(new SearchContextHighlight(fields));\n   }\n}\n\nFor some (advanced) uses I want to be able to parse individual elements myself by relying on the actual core implementation, and to do that I need to use a hack like this:\n\n```\n                        HighlighterParseElement tmp = new HighlighterParseElement();\n                        SearchContext ctx = new SearchContext(0, null, null, null, null, null, null, null);\n                        tmp.parse(parser, ctx);\n                        searchContextHighlight = ctx.highlight();\n```\n\nJust for the sake of parsing. It would be nice if the actual parsing logic could be separated from the call to the setter, something like this:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic void parse(XContentParser parser, SearchContext context) throws Exception {\n    try {\n        context.highlight(parseImpl(parser));\n    }\n    catch (IllegalArgumentException ex)\n    {\n        throw new SearchParseException(context, \"Highlighter global preTags are set, but global postTags are not set\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic static SearchContextHighlight parseImpl(XContentParser parser) throws Exception {\n  // actual impl\n```\n\n   }\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
