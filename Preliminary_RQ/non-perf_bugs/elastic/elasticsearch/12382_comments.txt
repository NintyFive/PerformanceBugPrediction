We parse until we reach an end object token. The YAML spec requires that all sibling nodes be at the same indentation level. Once the indentation is reduced in the example that @pickypg gave, a YAML parser that parses according to the spec will return an end object token and we will stop parsing. Therefore, to solve this we should just ensure that when we encounter an end object token while parsing settings, we are in fact at the end of the settings stream. I've submitted PR #12451 to do this.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
