The API changes rapidly enough that the documentation simply can't keep up - and the way Elasticsearch works with plugins means that it's not something that is easy to generate automatically.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 things we think we can do:\r\n1. Make some general improvements to the privileges pages. They've been around for a while, and haven't seen a lot of love in the last few years. We can definitely document some of those privileges more clearly so that it is more obvious what they are intended to allow.\r\n2. Make the \"permission denied\" error more explicit & actionable. At the moment you get something like _\"user [xyz] is not permitted to perform action [cluster:foo/bar]\"_  which is factually correct, but not of a lot of use to the person who it trying to setup roles for their needs. We can do better here.\r\n\r\nI'm going to raise issues for each of those, at which point I will close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/492889979","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37538#issuecomment-492889979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37538","id":492889979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Mjg4OTk3OQ==","user":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T02:14:45Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T02:14:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I raised\r\n- https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42165\r\n- https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42166\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
