This is not the case when the jobs are index documents as the number returned is limited by the size of the search. The current default search size of 10 is not sufficient. Alternatives are to increase the search size to an arbitrary large number or use scan and scroll to collect the jobs.  \r\n\r\nPage parameters could be added to the GET jobs request then it would be up to the client to page through jobs but this would be a breaking change if the behaviour of GET jobs was changed to return a subset of the jobs (page size) instead of all. Additionally page params do not work well with scan and scroll which is the preferred way to page results.
