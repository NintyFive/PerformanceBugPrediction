Due to the distributed nature of Elasticsearch indices it joins do not scale well. This is why for parent/child documents we required the parent and child document to be located on the same shard, because joining across shards (or indices) in a distributed environment would not perform well\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/127955382","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12592#issuecomment-127955382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12592","id":127955382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzk1NTM4Mg==","user":{"login":"reshadman","id":5187816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODc4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5187816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reshadman","html_url":"https://github.com/reshadman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reshadman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reshadman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reshadman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reshadman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reshadman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reshadman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reshadman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reshadman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reshadman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-05T10:59:38Z","updated_at":"2015-08-05T10:59:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @colings86 .
