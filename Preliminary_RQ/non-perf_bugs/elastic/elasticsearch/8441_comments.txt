Since 1.4.0 the windows startup script fails if the path to ES contains spaces. Which happens with my user name and also if I install in \"C:\\Program Files. So the startup script is more or less unuseable with common configurations (installation in \"Program Files\"). Also the PATH of JAVA_HOME is in most cases containing spaces, because Oracle installs the JDK in \"C:\\Program Files\".\nI will check the patch on my local installation!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62803432","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8441#issuecomment-62803432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8441","id":62803432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODAzNDMy","user":{"login":"uschindler","id":1005388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDUzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1005388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler","html_url":"https://github.com/uschindler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-12T22:04:44Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T22:04:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, I checked, the quotes around the CALL fixes the issue!
