This\r\n *  includes allocations for things like the cardinality aggregation, and\r\n *  accounting for the number of buckets used in an aggregation request.\r\n *  Generally the amounts added to this breaker are released after a request\r\n *  is finished.\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there is also a `IN_FLIGHT_REQUESTS` breaker. This breaker is\r\ndescribed as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * The in-flight request breaker tracks bytes allocated for reading and\r\n * writing requests on the network layer.\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we serialize a message for writing to a channel in the http or tcp\r\ntransports, we use `BigArrays` which manipulates the `REQUEST` breaker.\r\nHowever, based on the descriptions, it seems like this should be the\r\n`IN_FLIGHT_REQUESTS` breaker.","closed_by":{"login":"tbrooks8","id":862472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjQ3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/862472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrooks8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
