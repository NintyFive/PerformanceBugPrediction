The best place to ask general questions is the [Elastic Discourse forums](https://discuss.elastic.co).\n\n> Why does new ES has so much more write IOPS? How do we prevent this?\n\nThis is probably due to fsyncing per request. If you're not using bulk requests, use bulk requests. If are you using bulk requests, you could look at increasing the size of the payload per request. Lastly, you can disable fsync per request by setting `index.translog.durability` to `async` but note that this comes with a loss of safety.\n\n> What is wrong with init script? We use official rpm and it seems there is a bug with init script - it does not correctly detect hung process. How can we fix that?\n\nDuplicates #19297\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/243478932","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20232#issuecomment-243478932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20232","id":243478932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzQ3ODkzMg==","user":{"login":"AGirin","id":5177657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzc2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5177657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AGirin","html_url":"https://github.com/AGirin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AGirin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AGirin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AGirin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AGirin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AGirin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AGirin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AGirin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AGirin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AGirin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T15:28:49Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T15:29:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for responding.
