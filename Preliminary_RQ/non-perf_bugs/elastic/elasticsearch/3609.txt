I'd want the fragment to start from the beginning for the field and otherwise be a normal highlight fragment.\n\nI was thinking you'd control it like so:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"query\" : {...},\n    \"highlight\" : {\n        \"order\" : \"score\",\n        \"fields\" : {\n            \"content\" : {\n                \"fragment_size\" : 150,\n                \"number_of_fragments\" : 3,\n                \"build_fragment_if_no_matches\": true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nwith build_fragment_if_matches default to false.\n\nWhile the client application could build the fragment itself it is unlikely it'd be able to do as good a job as Elasticsearch especially at language support.\n\nReturning a fragment from the beginning of the field when there aren't matches is pretty common for search engine style applications.  Google does it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
