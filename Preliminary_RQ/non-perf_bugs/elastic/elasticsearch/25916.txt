One possibility for unexpected behavior is that ES encodes the 32-bit integer as an 8-bit integer, then decodes back to 32-bit when used. Have not tested to confirm.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/22194920/how-is-field-length-defined-in-solr-lucene\r\n\r\nHowever, `avgFieldLength` *IS* an integer -- always (as far as I can tell).\r\n\r\nOne consequence of this is that the `tfNorm` (which is where `fieldLength` is being used) is influenced.\r\n\r\nIf, as in the stupid example below, there is just one document in one shard, one might expect either: (a) the same `_score` for both documents (which is what happens when `fieldLength` = `avgFieldLength`) or (b) the `_score` be greater for documents with shorter `fieldLength` (which would happen if the two documents were in the same shard). Instead the document with longer `fieldLength` wins out because of the strange `fieldLength`.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or feature?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDELETE m\r\n\r\nPUT m/d/2\r\n{\r\n  \"a\":\"one two\"\r\n}\r\nPUT m/d/5\r\n{\r\n  \"a\":\"one two three four five\"\r\n}\r\nGET m/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"explain\": true, \r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"match\": {\r\n      \"a\": \"one\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nreturns\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"hits\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"_shard\": \"[m][1]\",\r\n        \"_node\": \"pZzmcT7gRhaS6mZID5S0Lg\",\r\n        \"_index\": \"m\",\r\n        \"_type\": \"d\",\r\n        \"_id\": \"5\",\r\n        \"_score\": 0.2824934,\r\n        \"_source\": {\r\n          \"a\": \"one two three four five\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"_explanation\": {\r\n...\r\n                    {\r\n                      \"value\": 5.2244897,\r\n                      \"description\": \"fieldLength\",\r\n                      \"details\": []\r\n                    }\r\n...\r\n      {\r\n        \"_shard\": \"[m][2]\",\r\n        \"_node\": \"pZzmcT7gRhaS6mZID5S0Lg\",\r\n        \"_index\": \"m\",\r\n        \"_type\": \"d\",\r\n        \"_id\": \"2\",\r\n        \"_score\": 0.25811607,\r\n        \"_source\": {\r\n          \"a\": \"one two\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"_explanation\": {\r\n...\r\n                    {\r\n                      \"value\": 2.56,\r\n                      \"description\": \"fieldLength\",\r\n                      \"details\": []\r\n                    }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
