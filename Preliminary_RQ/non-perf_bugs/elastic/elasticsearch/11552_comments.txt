For example instead of whitespace being a problem, then it will be non-ascii paths from processbuilder (maybe only on windows) or whatever.\n\nAs far as bootstrap, personally i would prefer if \"forking\" was somewhere else. Or rather if we call this part bootstrap then if the current bootstrap logic was moved. Its already kind of a mess and really complicated stuff, if we can keep the forking part separate it would prevent it from being more confusing.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/172642261","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11552#issuecomment-172642261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11552","id":172642261,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjY0MjI2MQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-18T20:15:09Z","updated_at":"2016-01-18T20:15:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Argument parsing has been fixed and we've decided against the forking option.
