Marvel does delay startup for 5 seconds. Although that may not be enough, you also don't want to wait too long.

I've made a note of it and will ping you when it is fixed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/45119418","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5119#issuecomment-45119418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5119","id":45119418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTE5NDE4","user":{"login":"cdeck","id":1613850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM4NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1613850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdeck","html_url":"https://github.com/cdeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdeck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-04T17:02:04Z","updated_at":"2014-06-04T17:02:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68251262","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5119#issuecomment-68251262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5119","id":68251262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjUxMjYy","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-29T11:47:34Z","updated_at":"2014-12-29T11:47:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bleskes is this still an issue?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68677818","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5119#issuecomment-68677818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5119","id":68677818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Njc3ODE4","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-05T08:00:57Z","updated_at":"2015-01-05T08:00:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"should be fixed as of marvel 1.1.
