Also I noticed that even if there are valid hosts on the unicast list, it still crashes because one of them is not reachable: they all have to be reachable. \n\nIn general DNS entries temporarily not resolving, not being available, or changing over time should all be expected behavior with DNS.

whom interested. Actually you can start cluster from scratch in dynamic environment. When tried Elasticsearch with docker swarm mode, it worked. The main concern here is resolvability of hosts provided. If you are running in docker swarm mode or consul with registrator etc., after container starts and right before Elasticsearch process is being fired, DNS name already present in related service (swarm/consul/etc.). For instance:\n\n`docker service create --name elasticsearch-cluster1 --mode global \\\n    --mount src=logs-es-data,dst=/usr/share/elasticsearch/data --network test-net \\\n    encom/elasticsearch -Ecluster.name=test1 -Ediscovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts=tasks.elasticsearch-cluster1`\n\nworks fine.\n\nIn docker swarm mode `tasks.elasticsearch-cluster1` represents DNS entry with list of all containers under the service. For consul and registrator it would be `elasticsearch.service.dc1`. Worth to mention that in docker swarm service also has VIP (depending on your configuration) and related DNS entry `elasticsearch-cluster1`.

Alas, we are stuck with 2.4.x for the time being.\r\nAny chance that this is backported?\r\nBTW: I ran into a similar issue when I dockerized Zookeeper (where cluster \"discovery\" works in a similar fashion - by providing the list of cluster member hostnames & ports to each instance).  \r\nWorkaround for me was to create a script that goes over the list of hostnames and checks if they are available in DNS and retries until they all are (so basically doing externally what Zookeeper/Elasticsearch should be doing from the start - treating a DNS lookup error like any other network problem and retry...). \r\nThis approach also has the drawback that at least for startup your cluster needs to be fully available.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
