Then they opened the `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` file and changed `path.plugins` to point to a different folder (anything really)\n\nAfter this, they installed Marvel (or any plugin for that matter). Unfortunately, the plugin was installed into `/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins` instead of picking up the `path.plugins` override in the elasticsearch.yml file. Thus when starting ES, the plugin does not load correctly.\n\nThis can be potentially fixed by changing the plugin script line to:\n\n```\nexec $JAVA $JAVA_OPTS -Xmx64m -Xms16m -Delasticsearch -Des.path.home=\"$ES_HOME\" -Des.config=\"/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\" $properties -cp \"$ES_HOME/lib/*\" org.elasticsearch.plugins.PluginManager $args\n```\n\nI'm not 100% sure if this has other implications or is the right approach here.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
