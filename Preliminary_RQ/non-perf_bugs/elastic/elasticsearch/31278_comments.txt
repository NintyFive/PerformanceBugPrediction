Thanks for asking the question!  Elastic -- the company behind Elasticsearch -- produces a [security component](https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack/security) which allows role based access control.  You can use it to set read-only access for some users in exactly the fashion you describe.  We supply that functionality through a [subscription](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) or [our official cloud offering](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service).  If you'd like to learn more about our on-prem subscription offerings, you can let us know and ask any questions on the [subscriptions page](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) (look for \"Want to Learn More? We Love a Good Query\" on the page).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
