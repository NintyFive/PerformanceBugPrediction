This can lead to issues like https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23003.\r\n\r\nInstead we should reject value which are out of range for the selected numeric type (we do this for scaled_float but not currently for float, double and half_float, and we should check integer and long types). For completeness we should also reject explicit infinite values and NaN values in case a script produces these values. JSON does not have a concept of NaN or infinite values so they could only be explicitly inserted by scripts and never from standard index requests.\r\n\r\nAn open question is whether ignore_malformed should ignore out of range values?","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
