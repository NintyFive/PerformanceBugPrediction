However, because of [this line in PathTrie.java](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/6c23ace68fd9579e02d570d70aea8880ed3929be/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/path/PathTrie.java#L114), any path segment that contains a wildcard is reduced to match anything, ignoring any prefixes or suffixes:\n\n```\n/category-{index}/{type}/{id} => * as index -> * as type -> * as id\n```\n\nI'm sure more than just the jetty plugin would benefit from a trie that supported richer patterns (even simple ones) at each level of a path. The improvement would require a different implementation of PathTrie, but does not need an API change, meaning it could be implemented transparently.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
