I suggest you lower the soft limit on the maximum length of a regex query by lowering the index setting [`index.max_regex_length`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/index-modules.html#dynamic-index-settings) from its default value of 1000 (characters). This will make the respective query fail early instead of causing problems on the server-side. The specific failure should then point you to the query and allow you to fix it.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/553336767","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37637#issuecomment-553336767","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37637","id":553336767,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzMzNjc2Nw==","user":{"login":"YakobovLior","id":33580144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTgwMTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/33580144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YakobovLior","html_url":"https://github.com/YakobovLior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YakobovLior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YakobovLior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YakobovLior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YakobovLior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YakobovLior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YakobovLior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YakobovLior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YakobovLior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YakobovLior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T10:19:31Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T10:20:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey @danielmitterdorfer,\r\nCan you instruct how to change this setting? is is possible through cluster settings API?
