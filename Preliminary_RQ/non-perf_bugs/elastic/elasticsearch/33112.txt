Compared to the standard deviation, the IQR is less sensitive to outliers in the data, with a breakdown point of 0.25. Along with the median, it is often used in creating a [box plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot), a simple yet common way to summarize data and identify potential outliers.\r\n\r\nThe IQR is equal to the third minus the first quartile of a dataset, and could be calculated from the output of a `percentiles` aggregation. Even though it can be easily calculated from quantile information, it may still be useful to provide it as an aggregation for convenience, and to increase its visibility. An alternative option would be to describe the IQR as part of the `percentiles` documentation.\r\n\r\nCompared to the MAD (#26681), the IQR has a lower breakdown point (0.25, compared to 0.5). However, it is simple to calculate and is better equipped to handle skewed (asymmetric) data.\r\n\r\nRelates to #26681.","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
