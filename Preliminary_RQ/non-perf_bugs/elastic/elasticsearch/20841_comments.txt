This would fix the ambiguity between `match_query` and query parser based query. IMO the user should not have to read ten pages about query parsing to understand that this option should be used or not. If we can make it harmless for cases where it would not be required we can make it the default in 6.0 ?   \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/253757694","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20841#issuecomment-253757694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20841","id":253757694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mzc1NzY5NA==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T09:53:45Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T09:53:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Discuss in FixItFriday, we had an agreement that splitOnWhitespace=false should be the default but it would change the expectations for a lot of users so the proposed plan is to expose the feature in 5.x (with default to true) and change the default to false in 6.0.
