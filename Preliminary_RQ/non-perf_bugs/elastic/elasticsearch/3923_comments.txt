If we built the docs based on those tags, then we wouldn't be able to push doc corrections until the next release (or we'd end up with so many branches that it would be overwhelming).\n\nRegarding the added/deprecated macros, there are two forms:\n- inline, eg see `enable_position_increments` on http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-stop-tokenfilter.html\n- block, eg see http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-function-score-query.html#query-dsl-function-score-query\n\nI've purposely kept the inline form brief, either just a version number or a crossed out version number, with more info if you hover over it. \n\nSo the `coming[0.90.6]` version would need a `will_be_deprecated[0.90.6]` analog (open to suggestions on the naming :) ). But rendering the inline versions of these as `[coming in 0.90.6]` or `[will be deprecated in 0.90.6]` seems to defeat the point of keeping it short.\n\nThe other thing is we'd need to change all the `coming` macros to `added` macros when doing a new release, but that'd be easy enough to do with a little script (Go Perl Go!).\n\nThe above are my musings - in general I think we should do something like this, just looking for consensus on exactly what to do.\n\n@nik9000 Your wish is granted :)  https://github.com/elasticsearch/docs\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/26550639","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3923#issuecomment-26550639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3923","id":26550639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTUwNjM5","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-17T20:39:36Z","updated_at":"2013-10-17T20:39:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> The other thing is we'd need to change all the coming macros to added macros when doing a new release, but that'd be easy enough to do with a little script (Go Perl Go!).\n\nOr you could keep a list of unreleased versions and make the `added` macro spit out the coming rendering if the version it is referring to is unreleased.\n\nI don't think [coming in 0.90.6] is _too_ long for the inline form and it should be pretty rare because it'll change to [0.90.6] as soon as it is released.
