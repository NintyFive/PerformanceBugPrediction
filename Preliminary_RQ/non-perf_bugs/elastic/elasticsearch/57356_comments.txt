It looks like you are hitting an edge case since the jvm will default to serial GC in very few cases (are you on a single core?). And there isn't really anything we can do as far as upgrade warnings, especially in non-interactive scenarios. Configuration file conflicts are the realm of package managers. The change to use `jvm.options.d` makes those conflicts easier to deal with in the future, but the existing single `jvm.options` file conflicting across upgrades was a known issue, and exactly why we added the directory based approach.\r\n\r\nWe are sorry for your troubles, and happy that it looks like you figured out the correct workaround. Given that,  and our desire to leave configuration conflicts to package managers, I hope you don't mind that I close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/638468605","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57356#issuecomment-638468605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57356","id":638468605,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODQ2ODYwNQ==","user":{"login":"ddolcimascolo","id":5468291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjgyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5468291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddolcimascolo","html_url":"https://github.com/ddolcimascolo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddolcimascolo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddolcimascolo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddolcimascolo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddolcimascolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddolcimascolo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddolcimascolo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddolcimascolo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddolcimascolo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddolcimascolo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T21:21:03Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T21:21:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I don't mind at all, just wanted to hear you back üòè\r\nKeep up the good work! \r\n\r\nDavid ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
