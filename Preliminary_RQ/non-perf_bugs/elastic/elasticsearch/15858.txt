The term full_name uses a synonym analyzer. \nThe synonym expand file has the synonym: rice,arroz. \nNow if we run the validate query we get the below results:\n\n```\nGET /products_v2/product/_validate/query?explain\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"must\": [\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"full_name\": {\n              \"query\": \"rice\",\n              \"fuzziness\": 1,\n              \"minimum_should_match\": \"3<90%\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"should\": [\n        {\n          \"match_phrase\": {\n            \"name\": {\n              \"query\": \"rice\",\n              \"slop\": 50\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n{\n   \"valid\": true,\n   \"_shards\": {\n      \"total\": 1,\n      \"successful\": 1,\n      \"failed\": 0\n   },\n   \"explanations\": [\n      {\n         \"index\": \"products_v2\",\n         \"valid\": true,\n         \"explanation\": \"filtered(+((full_name:arroz~1 full_name:rice~1)~2) (name:arroz name:rice))->cache(_type:product)\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBoth rice and arroz are position 1. The minimum_should_match doesn't get applied to the position but the number of words in position 1.\n\nLet's say the synonym file has another synonym :  Brown Sugar, brownsugar.\nThe following is the result of the validate query calling brownsugar\n\n```\n{\n   \"valid\": true,\n   \"_shards\": {\n      \"total\": 1,\n      \"successful\": 1,\n      \"failed\": 0\n   },\n   \"explanations\": [\n      {\n         \"index\": \"products_v4\",\n         \"valid\": true,\n         \"explanation\": \"filtered(+(((full_name:brownsugar~1 full_name:brown~1) full_name:sugar~1)~2) name:\\\"(brownsugar brown) sugar\\\"~50)->cache(_type:product)\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this case the minimum to match is applied based on positions. brownsugar and brown are position 1, sugar is position 2. The minimum_should_match gets applied as 2.\n\nIf minimum_should_match gets applied based on the number of positions there are, I believe the above example for rice should have minimum_should_match should be 1 and not 2. This is a problem in the way ES handles minimum_should_match for one word synonyms.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
