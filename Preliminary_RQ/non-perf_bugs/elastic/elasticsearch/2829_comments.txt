Currently entries from the translog are always returned as is by the `ShardGetService`. So, if the data is read from the translog and not from the indexreader (before a refresh or a flush), the problem occurs.\n\nI have created a first preliminary and incomplete try to fix this, which I dont like very much and hope for input of other developers.
