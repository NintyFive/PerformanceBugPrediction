Open elasticsearch.yml & add a repository path to path.repo. The repository path should be asking for credentials (may be give cross domain machine's share)\r\n 2. Now execute this command to connect to the share: \"net use '\\\\machine-name\\share1'\"\r\n 3. Once you are connected, start Elasticsearch as a service. Fails with above mentioned exception. Try starting the same using \"elasticsearch.bat\", it works perfectly. \r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n[Elasticsearch Logs.zip](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/3954174/Elasticsearch.Logs.zip)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
