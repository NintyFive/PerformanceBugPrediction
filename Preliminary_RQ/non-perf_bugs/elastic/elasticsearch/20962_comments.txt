I see it as remove this index from the indices matched by the rest of the expression.\n\nWhatever we decide to do here, we have to remember to change the \"wildcarSeen\" behaviour, as with #20898 we explicitly support indices that have names starting with `-`. We don't have to support those in 6.x, hence we could either make the order not matter or reject index patterns with negations that don't start with a wildcard expression. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/254247808","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20962#issuecomment-254247808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20962","id":254247808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDI0NzgwOA==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-17T15:49:48Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T15:49:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> remove support for `+` (deprecate in 5.x), it is implicit when not specified\n\n+1\n\nAs far as the ordering goes, I agree with @bleskes, it's strange to have negations before adding anything, so I would be in favor of disallowing starting the expressions with `-` (requiring something like `*,-foo`)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/299524887","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20962#issuecomment-299524887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20962","id":299524887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTUyNDg4Nw==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-05T17:23:15Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T17:23:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Opened #24515 .
