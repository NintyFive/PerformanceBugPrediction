We are going to remove the auto-keystore creation from Elasticsearch and from the package installation. Instead, plugins can register if they require a keystore to exist. If a plugin registers that it does, the plugin installer will create this keystore if it does not exist, and will add the keystore.seed setting if it does not exist.\r\n\r\nSeparately, we will investigate restricting plugins to only be able to read their own config directory.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
