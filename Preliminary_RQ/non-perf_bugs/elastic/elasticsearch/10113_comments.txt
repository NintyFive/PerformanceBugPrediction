currently the `transform` object is treated as the script (this is actually (almost) backwards compatible as previously the `transform` object could have `lang`, `script` and `params` fields) , which is why you are getting the error. The following request does work:\n\n``` javascript\nPUT t\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"t\": {\n      \"transform\": {\n          \"file\": \"test\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI can change it so that we require the `script` object under the `transform` object but since we only have scripted transforms it seemed cleaner this way.
