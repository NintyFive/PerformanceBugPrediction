Can you provide any further details?\r\n\r\nWe test Elasticsearch 7 with TLS on Java 8.\r\nIf there is a configuration that worked for you on Java 11 but not Java 8, then we'd like to know the details.\r\n\r\nNote: Java 11 supports TLS1.3 but Java 8 does not, so it is possible to configure a node so that it will only work on Java 11 (e.g. by restricting it to TLS1.3 cipher suites) but you would have to go out of your way to make such a
