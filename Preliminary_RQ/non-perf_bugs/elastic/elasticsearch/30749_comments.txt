I do not see a need for this to be a YAML test as those are primarily geared towards enabling the language clients to test client functionality whereas I think this issue is more about testing that the REST handler does the right thing when given a body when it should not be given one. A handler is easy to create in a unit test:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        final RestForceMergeAction handler = new RestForceMergeAction(Settings.EMPTY, mock(RestController.class));\r\n```\r\n\r\nand a request with a body can be cooked up\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        final FakeRestRequest request =\r\n                new FakeRestRequest.Builder(NamedXContentRegistry.EMPTY).withContent(...).build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then check that the handler throws an exception on \r\n\r\n```java\r\n        handler.prepareRequest(request, mock(NodeClient.class));\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/390683128","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30749#issuecomment-390683128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30749","id":390683128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDY4MzEyOA==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-21T15:08:23Z","updated_at":"2018-05-21T15:08:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we could do it with a Java based REST test if we want to but I agree with Jason that it is probably good enough to do it with a unit test.
