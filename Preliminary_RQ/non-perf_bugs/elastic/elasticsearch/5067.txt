inactivity.\nES wasn't really happy with this apparently.\n\nSolution:\n\nset network.tcp.keep_alive true\n\nAdd following params to sysctl.conf:\n\nnet.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 60\nnet.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes = 6\nnet.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl = 10\n```\n\nI think it makes sense to at least mention this somewhere in the docs in order to help the
