Now I had to add few more data point to some specific logs and its failing somewhere. Failing means logstash is not sending the data to ES properly.\nFor example:\nprevious logs:\n1. A B C D\n   new logs:\n   1. A B C D\n   2. A B C D E F  \n\nI wrote corresponding rules for grok and placed rules for 2 and 1 in the same order in grok filter. Then logstash is not sending output to ES. If I put the 1st rule above the second rule, 'E' and 'F' 's data are missing in output. \n\nSo please tell me, what is the mistake I am doing?\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
