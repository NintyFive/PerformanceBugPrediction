It works fine.\n\nHowever, I have an issue when I try to update an entry. If I do, for instance\n\n```\nPOST documents/myDoc/123456789/_update\n{\n  \"doc\": { \"title\": \"my new title\"}\n}\n```\n\nAfter this update, I will have an empty value for `file.content`. From what I have understood, this is the standard behavior as the `file` is excluded from the `_source` and because file.content is also not in the `_source`. On partial updates, Elasticsearch looses the properties which are not on the `_source`.\n\nI know I can re-upload the document on every update but it is not convenient at all. My question is : Is there a way to force the `file.content` (the extracted text) to be part of the `_source`, so I will not loose the extracted text on a partial update ?\n\nThanks in advance for your answer.\n\nElasticsearch version : 2.2\nJVM version : 1.7.0_71\nOS version : Windows 2012 RC2\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
