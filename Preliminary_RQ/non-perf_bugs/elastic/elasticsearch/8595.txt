Some of them are very stable (a handful of update each day), some of them are very volatile (thousands of concurrent read/writes during the day, then left alone).\n\nI can't reproduce those errors. I can't pinpoint any specific query.\nI've been logging a lot and each time a query raise this error, I re-execute it and it runs well.\n\nI've not tried to downgrade to `1.3.x` yet. Maybe I will.\n\nI've been raking my brain for many days, with quite some frustration hence this evasive bug report.\n\nIf anyone has the beginning of an idea, I'd be happy to try and give as much information as I can.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
