The code is intertwined with a lot of my own code so I am going to paste snippets. \n### What's happening?\n\nWhen deleting **only** some documents while scrolling through a search query, then instead **all** the documents are deleted. \n\nThis is how I delete:\n\n``` java\nclient().prepareDeleteByQuery().setQuery(QueryBuilders.fieldQuery(\"_id\", id))\n```\n\nNote: My routing is `uri` field so I have to delete by query. \n### More Details\n\nThis is how I do my search.\n\n``` java\nSearchResponse searchResponse = client()\n                .prepareSearch(indicesForInterval(...))\n                .setSize(2000)\n                .setSearchType(SearchType.SCAN)\n                .setScroll(new TimeValue(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES))\n                .setFilter(...)\n                .execute().actionGet();\n```\n\n**However**, if I use `termQuery` instead of `fieldQuery` then the correct behavior happens. \n\nI can provide more detail if needed. But I have over 300 lines of code that has all this stuff baked in to my own classes. \n\nIs this a bug? Is it supposed to delete all documents when I am doing a scroll?\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
