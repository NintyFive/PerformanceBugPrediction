more thought, I think it’d be useful to provide a `boxplot` aggregation that returns essential information for making a boxplot. The output could look something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"min\": 0.1,\r\n    \"q1\": 0.15,\r\n    \"q2\": 0.43,\r\n    \"q3\": 0.5,\r\n    \"max\": 0.67\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe IQR could then be easily calculated through `q3 - q1` (we could also just include an `iqr` entry in the response if we think it’d be convenient).\r\n\r\nIn a basic boxplot, the whiskers extend to the min and max values. But in [another popular style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot#/media/File:Box-Plot_mit_Interquartilsabstand.png), the whiskers extend to the furthest points within [Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR]. Points that are outside this interval are considered outliers and usually displayed on the plot. Perhaps we could start with the basic five-number summary, then look into supporting the style with outliers if there’s interest.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
