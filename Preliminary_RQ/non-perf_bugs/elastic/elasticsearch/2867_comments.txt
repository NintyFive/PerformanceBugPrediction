IMHO, a far better one.\n\nSphinx uses LCS, which is a variation of simple edit distance. Lucene uses an exponential function for the decay as the the slop between words increases. Which do you think will be more precise? Look at the second example in the Sphinx documentation. Do you think 1 is the best answer? \n\nThat said, no edit distance method is perfect for every scenario. A query rescorer would be a good place for other methods. \n\nEDIT: do not want to link to the source, but I was able to find a recent blog post about proximity scoring in Lucene. \n\nhttp://sujitpal.blogspot.com/2015/04/scoring-token-distance-in-lucene-sloppy.html\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/115747326","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2867#issuecomment-115747326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2867","id":115747326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTc0NzMyNg==","user":{"login":"kshnurov","id":498185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODE4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/498185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kshnurov","html_url":"https://github.com/kshnurov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kshnurov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kshnurov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kshnurov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kshnurov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kshnurov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kshnurov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kshnurov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kshnurov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kshnurov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-26T16:30:43Z","updated_at":"2015-06-26T16:30:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rmuir what will make proof for you if not all of this reports saying and proving that term proximity scoring will dramatically improve text search ranking?
