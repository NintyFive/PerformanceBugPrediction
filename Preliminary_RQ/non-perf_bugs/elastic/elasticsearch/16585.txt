What does that buy us? The elasticsearch zip, tar, deb, and rpm distributions bundle log4j and logging.yaml doesn't work without it. When Elaticsearch is used as a client library master no longer tries to configure the logger because that is crazy behavior for a library. Normal Java libraries just pick a logging dependencies and use it. They rely on the user to include whatever bridges are required. Can we get away with being normal?\n\nProposal: Remove support for java.util.logging and slf4j logging support. We fold the log4j support into its parent class/package. We put a breaking change note for users of the TransportClient that they'll need to include the appropriate shim to point log4j12 at whatever logging library they use. They probably already have it on their classpath. We get to nuke three whole packages, lots of weird try/catch statements, and 2 optional dependencies.\n\nIf anyone asks why we still use log4j12 when log4j2 and logback are all around we tell them that it works and we have bigger fish to fry....\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
