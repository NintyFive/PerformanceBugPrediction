For example:\n\n```\n\n{\n   \"aggs\": {\n      \"nested_aggregation\": {\n         \"nested\": {\n            \"path\": \"Applications\"\n         },\n         \"aggs\": {\n            \"deeper_nested_filter\": {\n               \"filter\": {\n                   \"nested\": {\n                      \"path\": \"Applications.CheckItems\",\n                      \"filter\": {\n                          \"term\": {\n                             \"Applications.CheckItems.CheckType\": \"somechecktype\"\n                          }\n                      }\n                   }\n               }\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n\n```\n\nI realise I could do another nested aggregation onto checkitems, filter on check type and reverse nest back up.  That works for this simple example.\n\nWhat I actually want to do is filters where an application only has certain check types, and the only way to do this is from the context of the application.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
