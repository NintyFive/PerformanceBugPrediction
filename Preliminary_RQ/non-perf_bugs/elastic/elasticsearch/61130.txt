AuthenticationType is a new addition (#38291) to the Authentication class after the last change (#35648) to the authentication response object. It was unintentional that it did not get added to the authentication response. \r\n\r\nWe should add it because:\r\n1) it makes the authentication response more complete\r\n2) it is the only thing that can tell the difference of a token auth\r\n\r\nOne might argue that auth type is something that the client already knows so it is not very useful. But from a client side point of view: a connection object can be created with token authentication in one place where the client is aware of the authentication type. But the object can subsequently be passed to somewhere else where it might be a hassle to find out this information from the connection object itself. Iâ€™d personally prefer to have the authentication response to cover all necessary information. From server side perspective, I prefer to not assume what clients may or may not know already and always provide complete set of information.","closed_by":{"login":"ywangd","id":2344308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDQzMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2344308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd","html_url":"https://github.com/ywangd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
