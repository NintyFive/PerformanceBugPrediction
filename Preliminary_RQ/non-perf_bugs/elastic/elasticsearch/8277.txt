However, once transport-couchbase has been installed on the ES cluster, all indexes in the cluster have this section added to their mappings:\n\n``` json\n\"couchbaseCheckpoint\" : {\n  \"_source\" : {\n    \"includes\" : [\n      \"meta.*\",\n      \"doc.*\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"dynamic_templates\" : [\n    {\n      \"store_no_index\" : {\n        \"mapping\" : {\n          \"index\" : \"no\",\n          \"include_in_all\" : false,\n          \"store\" : \"no\"\n        },\n        \"match\" : \"*\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"properties\" : {\n    \"meta\" : {\n      \"include_in_all\" : false,\n      \"type\" : \"object\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo try and fix this, I've changed the first line of the template from:\n\n``` json\n\"template\" : \"*\",\n```\n\nto\n\n``` json\n\"template\" : \"couch-*\",\n```\n\nI edited the template file then used:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/_template/couchbase -d @plugins/transport-couchbase/couchbase_template.json\n```\n\nI then checked that the template that Elasticsearch had was indeed the edited version using: \n\n```\ncurl -XGET localhost:9200/_template/\n```\n\nThe output showed me the edited version of the template with \n\n```\n\"template\" : \"couch-*\",\n```\n\nHowever, this did not prevent the couchbaseCheckpoint section from appearing on the mappings of indexes created after the change. I opened this as an issue for transport-couchbase but was advised to bring it to the attention of the Elasticsearch team.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
