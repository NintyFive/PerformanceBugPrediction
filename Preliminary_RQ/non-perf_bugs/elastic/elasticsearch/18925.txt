I have following address data\n\n| Margaretenstraße | 1            | Krailling | Deutschland |\n| Margaretenstraße | 2A          | Krailling | Deutschland |\n| Margaretenstraße | 3            | Krailling | Deutschland |\n| Margaretenstraße | 4            | Krailling | Deutschland |\n\nI created index - only simple without analysing.\n\nI called _search query\n\n```\n{\n  \"explain\": true, \n  \"query\": {\n    \"multi_match\": {\n      \"type\": \"most_fields\",\n      \"query\": \"margaretenstraße krailling 4\",\n      \"tie_breaker\": 1,\n      \"fields\": [\n        \"house_number\",\n        \"street\",\n        \"city\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd it returns correct object \"margaretenstraße krailling 4\". But when I add some boosting to city - city^2 it looks like it ignores house number field and returns \"margaretenstraße krailling 4\". When I analyzed scoring in explain, there is **no score for matching house_number field at all**.\n\nWhat can cause this problem? Is it common behavior? I tried it more times and sometimes when I create a new, the same index it works but sometimes not.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
