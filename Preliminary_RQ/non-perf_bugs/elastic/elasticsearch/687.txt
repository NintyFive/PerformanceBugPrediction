This is handy for example to make sure search is only done on a specific thread pool since it associates resources per thread.\n\nThe new thread pools include:\n- `index`: for index/delete/bulk operations.\n- `search`: For get/count/search operations.\n\nEach pool can have a `type` associated with it, and based on the type, associated parameters. The types can be `cached`, `fixed`, `scaling`, and `blocking`.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
