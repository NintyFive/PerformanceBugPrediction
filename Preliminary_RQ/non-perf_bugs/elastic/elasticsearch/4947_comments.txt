The filter is cached with whatever `now` evaluates to.  Typically filtering on eg `now - 1h` makes sense not to cache, because you'll never reuse that value.\n\nBut a filter with `now/d` likely will be reused. Think about this pattern when retrieving logs for the last hour in an index containing logs for the whole month:\n\n```\n\"bool\": {\n    \"must\": [\n        { \"range\" : {\n            \"timestamp\" : {\n                \"gt\" : \"now/d\" \n            }\n        },\n        { \"range\" : {\n            \"timestamp\" : {\n                \"gt\" : \"now-1h\" \n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nYou want the first filter to be cached, and the second filter not to be cached.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/33679602","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4947#issuecomment-33679602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4947","id":33679602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjc5NjAy","user":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-30T11:26:36Z","updated_at":"2014-01-30T11:26:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Could
