That is not possible anymore, given that if `ElasticsearchRestTestCase` comes from within a jar, REST tests and spec can only be taken from that specific jar. Only the usecase where a plugin needs to run REST tests coming from elasticsearch core is handled right now; a plugin cannot run its own tests, unless I am missing a way to do it. We need to add back this feature to the REST test infra, it doesn't need to be able to run tests from any file system location as it used to be though (way too much!).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/112811162","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11721#issuecomment-112811162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11721","id":112811162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjgxMTE2Mg==","user":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-17T13:59:04Z","updated_at":"2015-06-17T13:59:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The parameterized discussion is definitely involved here. Besides being completely useless, parameterized tests just make things complicated, because nothing can happen except in clinit (so no subclassing).
