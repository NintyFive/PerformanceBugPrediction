I've changed the issue to be more general.  Now this is a feature request to let the user specify a query against which highlighting will run in the highlight element.  Like this:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/test/test/_search?pretty -d'{\n  \"fields\": [\n    \"_id\"\n  ],\n  \"highlight\": {\n    \"order\": \"score\",\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"text\": {\n        \"number_of_fragments\": 1,\n        \"score_query\": {\n          \"bool\": {\n            \"must\": {\n              \"match\": {\n                \"text\": {\n                  \"query\": \"central iraq\"\n                }\n              }\n            },\n            \"should\": {\n              \"match_phrase\": {\n                \"text\": {\n                  \"query\": \"central iraq\",\n                  \"phrase_slop\": 3,\n                  \"boost\": 10.0\n                }\n              }\n            },\n            \"minimum_should_match\": 0\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"text\": {\n        \"query\": \"central iraq\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nThis is the old issue:\nWhen sorting highlights by score the rescore query should be used if there is one.  At least, I think it should be.\n\nThis gist: https://gist.github.com/nik9000/6451307\nShould spit out: `\"Mesopotamia, while Mithna ibn Haris withdraw from <em>central Iraq</em> to the region near the Arabian desert to delay\"`\nRather than: `\"of <em>Iraq</em> fell to the Muslims after initial resistance in the Battle of Hira.  File:Ctesiphon, <em>Iraq</em> (2117465493)\"`\n\nI have a pretty simplistic solution for this I'll submit once I'm done running it through tests.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
