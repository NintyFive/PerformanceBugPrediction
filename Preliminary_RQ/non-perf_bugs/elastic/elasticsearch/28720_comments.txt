Rollover consists of two separate steps: (1) Create a new index and wait for that index to be ready; (2) Updates the alias to point to the new index. If the index template's aliases contain the rollover alias, the rollover alias will point to two indices between step 1 and step 2. Unfortunately, this is your case; you should remove the `customer` alias from the index template. We will fail a rollover request in 6.2.0 if the rollover alias found in the index templates (See https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/28110).
