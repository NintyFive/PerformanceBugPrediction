Better keep things simple and decide on a comfortable number of replicas (1?) to allow for acceptable data loss. I presume the caches will carry most of the read load and we don't need to worry about that.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/384129275","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29712#issuecomment-384129275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29712","id":384129275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDEyOTI3NQ==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-10T17:34:58Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T01:15:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"*Original comment by @clintongormley:*\n\nProbably the only downside of not having the `.security` index on all nodes is that the cluster may not become available until all nodes have been started, which I think is OK\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/384129276","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29712#issuecomment-384129276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29712","id":384129276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDEyOTI3Ng==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-09T15:00:21Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T01:15:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"*Original comment by @jaymode:*\n\nAn interesting issue that seems to have cropped up in a customer request is that in a hot/warm architecture, overloaded warm nodes can cause the whole cluster to slow down including security operations.
