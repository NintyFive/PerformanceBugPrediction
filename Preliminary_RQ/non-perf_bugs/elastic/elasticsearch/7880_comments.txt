I think that end user need in that case to know this syntax and that all dates has been entered previously with this timezone.\n\nI think it might be a good option that the developer set the `timezone` in the query, so user only need to think about dates and enter in its interface something like `date:[* TO 2014]` and that's it.\n\nBehind the scene, it will end up with a query like:\n\n``` json\n{\n\"query\": {\n  \"query_string\": {\n    \"text\": \"date:[* TO 2014]\",\n    \"timezone\": \"GMT+1\"\n  } \n
