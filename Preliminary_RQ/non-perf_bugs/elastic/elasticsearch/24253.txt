Elasticsearch will try to allocate the shards in the nodes, and if you have too many shards you can hit different type of issues:\r\n\r\n1. Too many open files (File Descriptor Issues).\r\n2. High memory usage.\r\n3. Large cluster states\r\n\r\nI think that if we add a Soft Limit for the number of shards per node, we could be at least preventing [1] and [2] , and [3] shouldn't be too problematic and can be easily fixed in an existing cluster.\r\n\r\nCC @clintongormley ","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
