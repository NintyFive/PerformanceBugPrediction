I am not 100% sure what they should be but I was able to make something work, but is a lot different the docs suggest.\r\n\r\nI found that this line:\r\n```\r\nAliasActions aliasAction =\r\n        new AliasActions(AliasActions.Type.ADD)\r\n        .index(\"index1\")\r\n        .alias(\"alias1\");\r\n```\r\nseems it should be\r\n```\r\nAliasActions aliasAction =\r\n       AliasActions.add()\r\n        .index(\"index1\")\r\n        .alias(\"alias1\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when trying to figure out how to execute request I could not figure out how to do it a similar way to the docs:\r\n```\r\nIndicesAliasesResponse indicesAliasesResponse =\r\n        client.indices().updateAliases(request, RequestOptions.DEFAULT);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I figured out is something like this (this one line should be all you need for a simple add):\r\n```\r\nResponse indicesAliasesResponse = client.admin().indices().prepareAliases().addAlias(\"index1\", \"alias1\").get()\r\n\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
