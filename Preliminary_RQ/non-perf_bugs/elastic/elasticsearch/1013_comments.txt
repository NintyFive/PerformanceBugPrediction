I'm also there, and can give advice related to _Tire_. I think this is possible an issue in _Tire_, not _ElasticSearch_, so feel free to submit ticket [there](https://github.com/karmi/tire/issues).\n\nBesides, I wonder why do you make this so much complicated for you, why not simply use the _ActiveRecord_ integration of _Tire_?\n\n``` ruby\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      include Tire::Model::Search\n      include Tire::Model::Callbacks\n\n      def to_indexed_json\n        {\n          :id          => id,\n          :first_name  => first_name,\n          :last_name   => last_name,\n          :employee_t4 => employee_t4,\n          :description => description,\n          :shop_id     => shop_id,\n          :email       => email,\n          :role_id     => role_id,\n          :active      => active\n        }\n      end\n\n    end\n\n    User.elasticsearch_index.import User.all\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
