However, this means that 6-8 potentially large model snapshots are retained for each extra day that is configured.\r\n\r\nIt would be nicer if the retention policy could be changed to something like \"retain all model snapshots for 1 day, plus 1 model snapshot per day for 6 days before that, plus 1 model snapshot per week for 21 days before that\".\r\n\r\nThis leads to some questions:\r\n\r\n1. How could we allow such policies to be configured in a way that is backwards compatible with our current configuration setting?\r\n2. Or, should we completely change the way model snapshot retention is configured as a breaking change in 8.0, and migrate the existing setting to the new format on upgrade to 8.x?\r\n\r\nOnce the configuration mechanism is decided it should not be very difficult to make the code changes necessary to action the configured policy.","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
