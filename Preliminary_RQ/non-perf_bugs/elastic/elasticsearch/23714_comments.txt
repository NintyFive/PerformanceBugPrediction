If I am understanding correctly, the field number is used throughout the other files to reference a field rather than the name. Is it possible to modify that file? There is an [old, open issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2160) with a patch that does just that, however it screwed up ordering.

Note that unlike previous versions of Lucene, the fields are not numbered implicitly by their order in the file, instead explicitly.\r\n\r\nIf modifying the FNM file is not possible, can ES store its own field name mapping? A mapping between the source's name and some immutable, unique name generated by ES? The ES name is used in Lucene and in rest of the ES codebase, and renaming a field is just updating that mapping.
