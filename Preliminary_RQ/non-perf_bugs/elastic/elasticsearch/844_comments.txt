having the same problem. \nI hope to publish it in the next version. \nThis is very important because I am doing a search for similar topics in Quora - http://www.quora.com, so it's important to boost the prevailing topics.\nMaking a more detailed analysis of the code elasticsearch realized that the class defining \nthis WildcardQueryParser query.setRewriteMethod (MultiTermQuery.CONSTANT_SCORE_AUTO_REWRITE_DEFAULT),\n we have to change to query.setRewriteMethod (WildcardQuery.SCORING_BOOLEAN_QUERY_REWRITE). \nthis option is native lucene, which kimchy had to do was have a configuration option which defined this new type of rewrite. \nObservation is that switching to SCORING_BOOLEAN_QUERY_REWRITE makes the search slower.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/1685792","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/844#issuecomment-1685792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/844","id":1685792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODU3OTI=","user":{"login":"gustavobmaia","id":585538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTUzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/585538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavobmaia","html_url":"https://github.com/gustavobmaia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavobmaia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavobmaia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavobmaia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavobmaia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavobmaia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavobmaia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavobmaia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavobmaia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavobmaia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-07-29T22:18:06Z","updated_at":"2011-07-29T22:18:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It
