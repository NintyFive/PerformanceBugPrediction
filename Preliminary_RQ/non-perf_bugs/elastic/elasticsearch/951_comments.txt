If you want this feature, simply implement it in your river. Most rivers are built similar and use a an indexer and a slurper thread. Before doing anything inside the slurper thread, recheck the configuration by getting it from the _river index and check for a enabled/disabled boolean, which might have been set while the thread was sleeping. Did that for all my rivers in order to disable getting data from flaky sources or when doing administration work on those systems.\n\nNo need for getting this natively into ES.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
