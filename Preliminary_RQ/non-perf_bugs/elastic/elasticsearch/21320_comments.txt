However, it is not permitted to state it numerically with a negative sign, as \"−00:00\", \"−0000\", or \"−00\". The section dictating sign usage (section 3.4.2 in the 2004 edition of the standard) states that a plus sign must be used for a positive or zero value, and a minus sign for a negative value. Contrary to this rule, RFC 3339, which is otherwise a profile of ISO 8601, permits the use of \"-00\", with the same denotation as \"+00\" but a differing connotation.\n\nIt appears that you have to specify a `-` or a `+`. But, this wasn't required in 1.x so something changed and thus broke. I think bare minimum this needs to be documented in the breaking changes and or supported. I lean towards breaking changes.
