we could perhaps move the \"well-behaved\" actions into the `GENERIC` threadpool and bound the queue on the `MANAGEMENT` threadpool to push back on anything that's left.\r\n\r\nHowever we don't see too much urgency on this front, and there are more general questions about how we assign work to the various threadpools that subsume this one, so we decided to proceed on the local improvement to stats performance in #51991 and close this issue to indicate that we won't be working on it in the near future.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
