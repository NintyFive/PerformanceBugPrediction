For example, given \nthe data and query given in this gist: \n\nhttps://gist.github.com/mattweber/71033b1bf2ebed1afd8e\n\nIt would like to be able to do something like the following for a \"profit\" calculation:\n\n```\n\"cost_agg\": {\n    \"filter\": {\n        \"term\": {\n            \"type\": \"cost\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"aggs\": {\n        \"cost_sum_agg\": {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"field\": \"value\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n},\n\"sale_agg\": {\n    \"filter\": {\n        \"term\": {\n            \"type\": \"sale\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"aggs\": {\n        \"sale_sum_agg\": {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"field\": \"value\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n},\n\"profit_agg\": {\n    \"metric_script\": {\n        \"script\": \"sale_agg>sale_sum_agg - cost_agg>cost_sum_agg\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo using the data from the gist we would get a response such as:\n\n```\n{\n  \"key\" : \"foobar\",\n  \"doc_count\" : 4,\n  \"sale_agg\" : {\n    \"doc_count\" : 2,\n    \"sale_sum_agg\" : {\n      \"value\" : 65.48\n    }\n  },\n  \"cost_agg\" : {\n    \"doc_count\" : 2,\n    \"cost_sum_agg\" : {\n      \"value\" : 24.68\n    }\n  },\n  \"profit_agg\": {\n    \"value\": 40.80\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI believe something like this would be possible given the fact that the\nthe `order` parameter of a Terms Aggregation can refer to metric sub-aggregation\nvalues.  The logic and retrieving the values should be very similar.  Exposing\nthem to a script might be the hard part.\n\nI will look into this further but I wanted to open the issue in case you are\nworking on similar functionality or have any suggestions for me.\n\n/cc @uboness @jpountz \n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
