just had a similar issue when switching networks and could boil it down to this:\n\nElasticSearch installed on my local dev notebook\nAccess to my index works fine both from Java and REST (via Kibana)\nSwitched notebook to stand-by, went home, woke it in my home network\nThe REST interface still works fine (via Kibana)\nThe java interface (both java app and ES restarted) does throw errors, in which it mentions the old office IP:\n\n[2014-02-20 21:28:14,875][WARN ][discovery.zen            ] [Mister Jip] failed to connect to master [[Dakimh the

however started using the new IP:\n[Gabe Jones] bound_address {inet[/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9201]}, publish_address {inet[/192.168.1.7:9201]}\n\nAfter a full reboot, everything was back to normal.\n\nConclusion: It seems that the java client somehow/somewhere caches the previous ip (of course I restarted the java client app).\n\nHope this
