specifically on the list, I think we can simply remove `top_children`  and `fuzzy_like_this`, I don't think they are that helpful and would be a shame to even have a plugin that tries to maintain them.\n\nI think we should keep `sig_terms` in core, its an important aggregation that needs to meet the level of \"core\".\n\n`token_count` and `murmur` I think its ok to move it to a plugin, I think its interesting to know how many people use the murmur option in conjunction with cardinality, if a lot, then it might be a core level feature?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/88497204","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10368#issuecomment-88497204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10368","id":88497204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4NDk3MjA0","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-01T14:06:55Z","updated_at":"2015-04-01T14:06:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"IMO
