I always want it to be creating an index based on a pre-existing template for the mapping.\r\n\r\nI've been bitten very badly by elasticsearch's guessing the types of fields in the record, and therefore we would find it highly desirable to have a way to turn off that particular feature.\r\n\r\nSo the feature request is: some new setting, whenever an index is created, it *must* be from a template mapping, and the mapping should never be guessed at. ES should fail to create the new index if a matching template is not available, and no data should be writable to that (absent) index.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I want ES to always be using a template, or to fail to write and create a new index if there is no appropriate template available.","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
