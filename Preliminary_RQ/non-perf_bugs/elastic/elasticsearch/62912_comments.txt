Would you mind to follow up on this in the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and as long as this isn't reproducable I think it's more likely this is a usage question. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Please reopen if this can be narrowed down to an ES bug after all.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
