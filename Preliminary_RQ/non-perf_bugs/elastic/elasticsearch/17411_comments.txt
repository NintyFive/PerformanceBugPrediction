This is exactly what the deprecation logger is for, and there should be exactly one place where this validation occurs (`RootObjectMapper.findTemplateBuilder`).\r\n* The case of match all is interesting, and does present something we at least don't want to break outright. However, I think it is a special case, and if the template contains a `type` for the mapper, then we should apply strictness, at least as a start to remove some level of trappiness?\r\n\r\n@jpountz wdyt?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
