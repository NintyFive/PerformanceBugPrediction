We introduced this bug in 5.5 but it doesn't mean that your index or cluster is broken. It's annoying because the exception is logged on every refresh (and at startup) but it's only because it tries to load global ordinals for a field that does not exist. There is a fix in the upcoming release of es (5.6), in the mean time you can just ignore the exception since it doesn't prevent the use of the parent/child feature.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/324337589","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26341#issuecomment-324337589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26341","id":324337589,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDMzNzU4OQ==","user":{"login":"abhiCR7","id":13649070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ5MDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13649070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiCR7","html_url":"https://github.com/abhiCR7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiCR7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiCR7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiCR7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiCR7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiCR7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiCR7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiCR7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiCR7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiCR7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-23T13:48:23Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T13:48:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jimczi Thanks for the clarification.
