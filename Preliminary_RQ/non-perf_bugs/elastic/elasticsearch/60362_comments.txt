We have an existing issue to add resiliency to reindex (#42612), which seems to be what you are looking for?\r\n\r\nSeeing \"Node not connected\" would normally signal a network level problem and this may be worth looking into to improve stability until that effort lands in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso, \"No search context found for id\" could be an indication of instability (network/node) or that the default scroll timeout is too small for your use case. It might be worth trying with a larger scroll timeout to see if this helps.\r\n\r\nGiven that we already have this problem registered in #42612, I will go ahead and close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
