the date format is defined in mapping, you can not use another format when querying using range date query or filter.\n\nFor example, this won't work:\n\n```\nDELETE /test \n\nPUT /test/t/1\n{\n  \"date\": \"2014-01-01\"\n}\n\nGET /test/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"range\": {\n          \"date\": {\n            \"from\": \"01/01/2014\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt causes:\n\n```\nCaused by: org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchParseException: failed to parse date field [01/01/2014], tried both date format [dateOptionalTime], and timestamp number\n```\n\nIt could be nice if we can support at query time another date format just like we support `analyzer` at search time on String fields.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```\nGET /test/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"range\": {\n          \"date\": {\n            \"from\": \"01/01/2014\",\n            \"format\": \"dd/MM/yyyy\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSame for queries.\n\nFor now, we can still support it by setting in mapping different expected formats:\n\n```\nDELETE /test \n\nPUT /test\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"t\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"date\": {\n          \"type\": \"date\",\n          \"format\": \"yyyy-MM-dd||dd/MM/yyyy\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT /test/t/1\n{\n  \"date\": \"2014-01-01\"\n}\n\nGET /test/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"range\": {\n          \"date\": {\n            \"from\": \"01/01/2014\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
