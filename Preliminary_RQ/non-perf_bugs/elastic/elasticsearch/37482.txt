Elastic could then disable shard allocation and do a sync flush before terminating, then re-enable shard allocation when it starts. \r\n\r\nThe option in elasticsearch.yml could enable and disable this feature.\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"ebadyano","id":26631211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjMxMjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26631211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano","html_url":"https://github.com/ebadyano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
