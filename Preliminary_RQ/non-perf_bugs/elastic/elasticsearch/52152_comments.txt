And in the use case that you have demonstrated it is indeed useless. \r\n\r\nThe only use case for it that I can think of would be to setup two patterns. One pattern would match `foo-*` and set all settings and mappings for indices `foo-NNNNNN` . Another pattern would match only `*-000001` and only set `\"is_write_index\": true` for the first index in the series. This can automate bootstrapping of the ILM indices to some degree.
