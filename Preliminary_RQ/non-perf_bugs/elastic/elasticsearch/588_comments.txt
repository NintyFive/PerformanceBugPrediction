My line of thinking was that you can provide \"base\" settings in the default settings file, and then use custom ones depending on what you run. But, I see where it might be confusing, so I can definitely change this behavior if it make more sense.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/648690","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/588#issuecomment-648690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/588","id":648690,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0ODY5MA==","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-01-03T10:54:01Z","updated_at":"2011-01-03T10:54:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Des.config=/path/to/config/file doesn&#39;t replace $ES_HOME/elasticsearch.conf, just appends to it, closed by 5e029865a80318fdee195d56941f22a3ec890056.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
