The `messages-20200101` gets auto followed and we only check for the existence of the corresponding follower index and not whether index following has really started. The pause follow index api fails if there are no shard follow tasks to stop.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to ensure that index following is active.\r\n\r\nNot that this is test problem, is only an issue for auto followed indices. This is because the test does not perform the index following, but the auto follower that runs in the background.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
