Concerns about overheard of maintaining this tool were raised. While we have other instances where such tool could have been beneficial (such as date checks) we typically don't provide such tools. One of the main technical concerns was practicality of such tool considering the requirement for full index scan. The overhead of running the checker on a large index would be comparable to re-indexing of such index, so a recommendation to just reindex might be a more efficient solution for users concerned that their index contain affected records. \r\n\r\nWe agreed that fixing these bugs in a minor version should be acceptable. We didn't reach a conclusion if we should maintain the old behavior for indices that were created before the bug fixes were introduced, it seems like that would create too much maintenance overhead considering that we are already maintaining \"legacy\" and BKD-backed shape indexing logic.
