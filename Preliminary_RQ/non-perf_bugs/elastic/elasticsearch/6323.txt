Before the pull request is merged it'd be squashed but during review it'd keep growing.\n\nIt'd be cool to document this on CONTRIBTUING.md and http://www.elasticsearch.org/contributing-to-elasticsearch/ .\n\nIf Elasticsearch grows pull request guidelines then can we add:  always make the subject of your pull request descriptive of what it does rather then what issue it closes.  These subjects turn into email subjects and it is a lot easier to filter what you need to read if the subject is descriptive like \"Splort the sort sprocket to make the sort faster\" or \"Fix overflow in the foo\" then \"Closes #1234\".\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
