Seeds are not necessarily the nodes that will be used for cross-cluster communications though. They are only contacted to retrieve the list of nodes belonging to the remote cluster, so that some (by default 3) nodes out of those in the list are selected (based on their version, role and possibly node attributes) and will be used for CCS requests.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to configure node attributes so that you can determine exactly which nodes are used for CCS communications.
