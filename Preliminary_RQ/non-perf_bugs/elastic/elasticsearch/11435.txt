Part of my adventure is data modelling and playing with mappings.\n\nI had a small index, called \"audit_v1\", which has 43,754 documents. I created a second index called \"audit_v2\" and did a scan & scroll and bulk create the 43,754 documents 500 at a time into the new index. I've done this 5 times now, and every single time I'm seeing not only fewer number of records showing up in the audit_v2 index, but it's the same number ever single time. This is despite the _bulk api not reporting any errors in the response. From what I can tell all the documents _should_ be there, but apparently they aren't. \n\nIs this a legit bug, or is it possible I'm misunderstanding exactly what [index]/_count returns?\n\nSorry for the trivial question, but I can't find a clear answer online. I'm using v1.5.0.\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"ryanbaldwin","id":955086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTA4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/955086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanbaldwin","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanbaldwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanbaldwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanbaldwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanbaldwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanbaldwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanbaldwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanbaldwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanbaldwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanbaldwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanbaldwin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
