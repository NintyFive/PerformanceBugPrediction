In #39793 we moved to an asynchronous model, freeing up the `write` thread to carry on with other indexing tasks.\r\n\r\nOne feature of the pre-7.2.0 blocking approach was that the number of `write` threads is limited and this limits the number of parallel dynamic mapping updates pending on the master. The asynchronous model has no such limit and may send a very large number of dynamic mapping updates in a short time since the shard bulks are processed much faster. Furthermore, many indexing operations may require the same mapping update but since they are now generated much more quickly it may be that many of the mapping updates sent to the master are duplicates.\r\n\r\nRelated [discussion thread](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/performance-degradation-after-upgrading-from-v6-3-2-to-v7-4-2/213466/5?u=davidturner).","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
