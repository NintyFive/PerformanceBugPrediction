You get the request json, but not the reply.\r\n\r\n**My feature request is to add, as much as possible, the *replies* of the requests example.**\r\n\r\nBecause in [a lot of](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query.html) [examples](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html) (all examples on these pages, not only the first one in the page) you get the queries, but you don't get the example replies, so you're not sure what you're supposed to get actually.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou could standardize on a simple dataset for all docs (easily accessible in one click), so one's can understand the API, now that she sees the dataset, the request, and the reply. \r\n\r\nTo sum it up, the reference docs would then become more tutorial-ish than reference only.\r\n\r\nI think that would help understand Elastic's API more quickly.\r\n\r\nThank's for listening.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
