As the error message explains, when inside a double quoted string, the only valid escapes are backslash and double quote. But your string has an escaped tab. All you should need to do is remove the double slash before `t`. Also note that you can use single quoted strings in painless to lessen the need for escaping json strings.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"source\":\"if(ctx._source['Person_emailList'] == null){ctx._source['Person_emailList'] = [];}ctx._source['Person_emailList'].add('\\\"bb@qq.com\\t');\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the future, please ask questions on [our forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).
