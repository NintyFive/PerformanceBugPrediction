This isolates the change to only Painless.\n\nto me this is all a question of how do we expose this. I had a chat with @jdconrad and @rjernst the other day about `asserts` and `println` in painless and there are a couple of concerns mainly around abuse. We are calling a script a gazillion times such that adding the slightest slow component has a huge impact. The design goal of this language was performance and security. I'm 100% convinced we should not make any compromises to this. We don't enable asserts in production code either unless the user specifies `-ea` to the JVM. We also don't log crazy stuff by default unless we are _debugging_ something. \nThat said, I really think we need to think about how to expose these _slow_ features. One scenario that I have in mind is to pass a `&debug_document={index}{type}/{id}` to the high level request and enable logging and assertions based on this:\n- we only apply this request to a single document which is what we should do anyway since it doesn't make sense to debug more than one?\n- it prevents people from _leaving it on_ in production and experiencing slowness (hard to misuse)\n- we would not even cache the compiled script but recompile every time so no need to add anything to the script or the json.\n- we would implicitly enable `asserts` and `println` logging (I hope with a limited buffer`512kb`maybe?)\n- we can transport this information with our thread context everywhere such a that we can leverage it else where. I was thinking about switching on logging per request in the future ie. just log all statements that this request hits (context wise) with debug. That would be a cool feature to have down the road.\n\nIf we'd do this we can develop these features in isolation, ie add asserts and logging to painless and expose it separately which I'd prefer.  \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/246658422","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20264#issuecomment-246658422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20264","id":246658422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjY1ODQyMg==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-13T11:58:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T11:58:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> One scenario that I have in mind is to pass a &debug_document={index}{type}/{id} to the high level request and enable logging and assertions based on this:\n\nThis sounds like we'd need to add a new API for every script calling context.
