I don't think this can explain big translogs as the translog is only closed after the engine is closed, so there are no writes possible while this is ongoing. For what it's worth - this is also fixed in #10624 as the snapshot is retrieved from a view held by the recovery code. That view has it's own reference to the relevant translog files.
