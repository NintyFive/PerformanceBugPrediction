The only drawback compared to today is that documents would get a different score after they are updated, even if the same seed is used.\r\n\r\nConsistent sorting on different point-in-time snapshots was more controversial. Here are some opinions:\r\n - there is nothing we can do in that case, we should set expectations and just remove the recommendation to use the `_uid` as a tie breaker\r\n - we should recommend using `_seq_no` as a tie-breaker for that purpose rather than `_uid`. It would not be stable in case of updates but is the best we can provide which works in practice.\r\n - we should automatically append `_seq_no` to every `sort` internally. Same reasoning as the previous idea but without exposing `_seq_no` which is quite an expert/internal feature.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/310501468","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25240#issuecomment-310501468","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25240","id":310501468,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDUwMTQ2OA==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-22T21:01:27Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T21:01:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">  The only drawback compared to today is that documents would get a different score after they are updated\r\n\r\nI don't see how this is any different than the way it used to be, using the docid.
