Thus switching from/to CFS completely as needed? If yes, how does it work then, it apply only on the new segments? Or it generally influences how segments are merged? In other words, if CFS is turned off and I turn it on, it will probably take some time for the change to take effect - until the next merge?\n\nAnyway, thanks for looking at this!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/19391145","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3166#issuecomment-19391145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3166","id":19391145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzkxMTQ1","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-13T13:22:13Z","updated_at":"2013-06-13T13:22:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lukas-vlcek you can update that ratio in realtime via the API. Yet, the merge policy that is in use at this point will not pick up the changes. You need to execute a flush via the API to enforce a new indexwirter to be opened. Like  this: `curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/index_name/_flush?full=true'` this will cause a new writer to be opened and a new MergePolicy will be created with the new settings.
