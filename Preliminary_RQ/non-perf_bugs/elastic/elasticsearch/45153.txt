are currently by default limiting the size of a blob written to S3 to 1GB and upload it in 100MB (or less if below 2GB heap are configured) multi-part chunks.\r\nSince we are never retrying an upload on failure, are not uploading a single blob in parallel and do not resume a multi-part upload after an outage we derive essentially no benefit from multi-part uploads to S3.\r\n\r\nWe should remove the multi-part upload code path in its current configurable form and simply upload via a single-part upload (only for blobs larger than 5GB we should use multi-part upload as required by the API). We are writing from a stream anyway so this should barely require any code changes. \r\nSince we are not planning on using multi-part upload for functional reasons for now, we should then also deprecate the mult-part size setting in `7.x` and remove it in `8.0`.\r\nMoreover, the maximum blob size in S3 is 5TB. There is no reason to split up files less than that into smaller blobs either => I think we should also simply set the default max blob size to those 5TB to further minimize API calls. This will also make LIST calls cheaper and introduces less risk of consistency issues on AWS S3.","closed_by":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
