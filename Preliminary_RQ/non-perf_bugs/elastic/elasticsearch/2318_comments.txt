just labelled back for discussion, in #11496 we started discussing again what we should do with delete against aliases. Seems like the best approach would be to reject delete against any alias (regardless of whether it's filtered or not). Also, when we expand wildcards we should not expand to aliases only for this api. The latter is trickier to be honest, we don't currently support this and in order to support it we should probably add yet another \"indices options\", which are already too many. I would love to simplify those indices options and the code around it before adding other ones to the
