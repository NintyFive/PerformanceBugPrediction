We added a protection in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34331 with a more descriptive message that prevents this configuration so it will be invalid to set a `shingle` filter before `synonyms` even if you don't have multi words synonyms. The workaround as you already noticed is to put the `shingle` filter **after** the synonyms. The `shingle` filter does not modify the input so it should be equivalent.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
