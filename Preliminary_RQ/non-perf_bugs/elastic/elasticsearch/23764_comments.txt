If you input an accent modifier in a standard tokenizer it will be kept as a token. The `icu_folding` will then removes that character leaving a blank token in the stream.\r\nEverything works, you'll just build an inverted list for this empty token.\r\nIt is not expected to use a standard tokenizer on a binary input and even doing so does not yield any exception/bug so I'll close this as resolved.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
