can you please try 6.1 again. I think [this change ](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/26321) has removed the cause for this entirely. If so I will go and backport the change for SearchSourceBuilder to `5.6` in the case we do another release. This is also the reason why I didn't find this earlier. I was always looking at 6.x and master but the code was different there.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/372807574","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27596#issuecomment-372807574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27596","id":372807574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjgwNzU3NA==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T20:29:45Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T20:29:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No additional feedback, closing.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
