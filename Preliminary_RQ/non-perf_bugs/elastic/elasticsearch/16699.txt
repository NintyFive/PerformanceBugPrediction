No problem here. Everything works well.\n\n2°/ Before the migration in 2.2.0 I had queries like this : \n\n`QueryBuilders.matchQuery(fieldname, s).operator(Operator.AND).analyzer(\"default_search\");\n`\n\nAs specifications changed, I modifed analyzer's names to \"default\" , so in my code have now : \n\n`QueryBuilders.matchQuery(fieldname, s).operator(Operator.AND).analyzer(\"default\");\n`\n\n3°/ Here is the problem !\n\nThe .analyzer(\"default\") produce this json : \n\n```\n          \"match\": {\n            \"roles_hierarchy\": {\n              \"query\": \"assistante\",\n              \"type\": \"boolean\",\n              \"operator\": \"AND\"\n              \"analyzer\": \"default\"\n            }\n          }\n\n```\n\nBut the query **do not use my \"default\" analyzer**, it seems to use another \"default\" one, because I don't have the good analyzing. If I remove the \"analyzer\": \"default\", it's OK, the result is good and the term \"assistante\" is well analyzed.\n\nSo I have to remove .analyzer(\"default\") every where in my code because there is a big side effect. \nI think there is a little problem here.\n\nXavier\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
