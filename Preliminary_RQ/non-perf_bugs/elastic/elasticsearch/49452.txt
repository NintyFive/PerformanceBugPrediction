E.g. bucket the results at 1 minute intervals and apply a `percentiles` agg per-bucket, then using a `moving_function` over 5 buckets and inside the script merge the sketches to produce a single sketch for that window of time.  \r\n\r\nWhen plotted, this gives a percentiles output of the last five minutes, every minute.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to what the [cumulative cardinality](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-pipeline-cumulative-cardinality-aggregation.html) agg does, except merging windows of percentiles together instead of cumulatively merging a cardinality sketch.\r\n\r\nI think the main difficulty will be exposing this functionality in a safe/simple manner to painless. I think we would first need to allow percentiles objects as a valid input (instead of just numerics/multi-valued stats) and then build a dedicated painless function similar to the existing moving averages (e.g. `MovingFunctions.percentiles(values)`)\r\n\r\nIf we can't find a good way to do this, we could always create a specialized \"moving percentiles\" pipeline agg but it would probably be better to extend `moving_function` first if possible.","closed_by":{"login":"iverase","id":29038686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDM4Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/29038686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase","html_url":"https://github.com/iverase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
