A dynamic script will visit each do and run the check. Even though `doc` uses a column store its going to be much slower than using the index. Dynamic scripts are useful for lots of stuff. Say you wanted to run a one-off report and wanted to get all of the `shopId`s that had a length of 10 or something. Or you wanted to do a scripted aggregation or something. They have their use, but a filter is always going to be faster.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
