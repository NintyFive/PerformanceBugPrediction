However, if you set `min_children: 0` intuitively I would expect this expression to now evaluate as \"truthy\" regardless of the number of returned results.\r\n\r\nIn our case, it makes a lot more sense for us to dynamically adjust the `min_children` parameter rather than dynamically changing the entire boolean query expression.\r\n\r\nHere's an example query demonstrating the issue. We're attempting to find a parent or child document by ID and return both the parent and child. The query fails to match when we find a parent with no children despite `min_children: 0`:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"size\": 1,\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"bool\": {\r\n      \"should\": {\r\n        \"terms\": {\r\n          \"_id\": [ \"9b6ca518-39be-48e8-b885-bee6fd7ea207\" ]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"must\": {\r\n        \"has_child\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"lab_tests\",\r\n          \"min_children\": 0,\r\n          \"query\": {\r\n            \"bool\": {\r\n              \"should\": [\r\n                {\r\n                  \"terms\": {\r\n                    \"_id\": [ \"9b6ca518-39be-48e8-b885-bee6fd7ea207\" ]\r\n                  }\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                  \"terms\": {\r\n                    \"_parent\": [ \"9b6ca518-39be-48e8-b885-bee6fd7ea207\" ]\r\n                  }\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                  \"terms\": {\r\n                    \"status\": [ \"active\", \"deprecated\" ]\r\n                  }\r\n                }\r\n              ],\r\n              \"minimum_should_match\": 1\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
