How do I do this in the `RestHighLevelClient`? Various scouring of the internet reveals nothing useful, though I do see `FilterPath.java` as a class on one of these Jars\r\n\r\nI see that in `RequestConverters.java:569` we have:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\n    private static void addSearchRequestParams(Params params, SearchRequest searchRequest) {\r\n        params.putParam(RestSearchAction.TYPED_KEYS_PARAM, \"true\");\r\n        params.withRouting(searchRequest.routing());\r\n        params.withPreference(searchRequest.preference());\r\n        params.withIndicesOptions(searchRequest.indicesOptions());\r\n        params.putParam(\"search_type\", searchRequest.searchType().name().toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT));\r\n        if (searchRequest.requestCache() != null) {\r\n            params.putParam(\"request_cache\", Boolean.toString(searchRequest.requestCache()));\r\n        }\r\n        if (searchRequest.allowPartialSearchResults() != null) {\r\n            params.putParam(\"allow_partial_search_results\", Boolean.toString(searchRequest.allowPartialSearchResults()));\r\n        }\r\n        params.putParam(\"batched_reduce_size\", Integer.toString(searchRequest.getBatchedReduceSize()));\r\n        if (searchRequest.scroll() != null) {\r\n            params.putParam(\"scroll\", searchRequest.scroll().keepAlive());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich severely limits the caller's ability to add their own params such as `filter_path` for when a bug like the one reported is discovered ... this limits the workaround options for when the SDK is imperfect, I'd recommend that `ActionRequest` the base class be equip with a flexible way to pass-through URL params (as bugs like the one reported above is highly likely to re-occur.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/421261865","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33692#issuecomment-421261865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33692","id":421261865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTI2MTg2NQ==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T07:47:09Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T07:47:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/421267170","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33692#issuecomment-421267170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33692","id":421267170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTI2NzE3MA==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T08:08:48Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T08:08:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing since this bug is already fixed by https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/32362 which will be available in 6.4.1 when it is released.
