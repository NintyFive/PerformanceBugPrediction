I'd sort of figured it worked like `assertBusy` and would throw an exception if the thing didn't happen in time. It doesn't. It returns a boolean.\r\n\r\nI scanned the usages and see a good 15% of calls to `awaitBusy` don't assert that the result is true. I figure most of those are bugs waiting to happen.\r\n\r\nMost of the calls to `awaitBusy` ultimately `assertTrue` on the result. Maybe someone just goes and cleans all these up? They are sneaky enough that something like the logger usage check might be useful here. Or actually throwing the exception. I dunno.
