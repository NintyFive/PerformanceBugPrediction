These fields should be added to the cat recovery API. Additionally, there is some inconsistency in the naming of the fields. Today we have:\n\n`bytes`: bytes to be recovered\n`total_bytes`: total bytes on disk\n`bytes_percent`: percent of bytes to be recovered that have been recovered\n\n`files`: files to be recovered\n`total_files`: total files on disk\n`files_percent`: percent of files to be recovered that have been recovered\n\n`translog`: translog ops recovered\n`translog_total`: total translog ops to be recovered\n`translog_percent`: percent of translog ops to be recovered that have been recovered.\n\nThis means that:\n\n`translog_percent = translog / translog_total`\n\nbut that\n\n`bytes_percent != bytes / bytes_total`\n\nand\n\n`files_percent = files / files_total`.\n\nThus, we should add `bytes_recovered` and `files_recovered`, rename `translog` to `translog_ops_recovered` and rename `translog_total` to `translog_ops` and then it will be\n\n`bytes_percent = bytes_recovered / bytes`,\n`files_percent = files_recovered / files`\n\nand\n\n`translog_ops_percent = translog_ops_recovered / translog_ops`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
