When there are no operations in the response, we schedule a follow-up and repeatedly poll on a scheduled delay until we receive operations in the response. Our goal is add an endpoint for a remote cluster to listen for changes in the global checkpoint on the leader. To do this, we will make the following changes:\r\n - [x] the replication tracker should make visible when the global checkpoint is updated #32659\r\n - [x] index shard should be modified for global checkpoint listeners to be registered #32696\r\n - [x] shard follow tasks should be updated to register a listener on a remote cluster to go into a long poll mode #33683\r\n\r\nWe will make the first of these two changes in master/6.x, and the third change will be made on the `ccr` feature branch.\r\n\r\nRelates #30086","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
