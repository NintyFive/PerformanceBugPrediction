However, in case of errors, clients need to traverse the complete response structure to get information like:\r\n\r\n* How many operations succeeded / failed?\r\n* Did we have shard failures? How many shards failed?\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what Rally extracts from a bulk response with 4.000 successful indexing operations, 500 operations where one out of two shards failed and 500 operations with both shards failed:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"bulk-size\": 5000,\r\n  \"errors\": true,\r\n  \"success-count\": 4000,\r\n  \"error-count\": 1000,\r\n  \"ops\": {\r\n    \"index\": {\r\n      \"item-count\": 5000,\r\n      \"created\": 4000,\r\n      \"noop\": 1000\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"shards_histogram\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"item-count\": 4000,\r\n      \"shards\": {\r\n        \"total\": 2,\r\n        \"successful\": 2,\r\n        \"failed\": 0\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"item-count\": 500,\r\n      \"shards\": {\r\n        \"total\": 2,\r\n        \"successful\": 1,\r\n        \"failed\": 1\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"item-count\": 500,\r\n      \"shards\": {\r\n        \"total\": 2,\r\n        \"successful\": 0,\r\n        \"failed\": 2\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n   \"took\": 30,\r\n   \"errors\": true,\r\n   \"items\": [ { \"...\": \"...\" } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note: Don't treat this as definitive response structure. This just serves as an illustration of what I'm after._\r\n\r\nWhat I want to put up for discussion is:\r\n\r\n1. Is such a feature useful for clients in general?\r\n2. If yes, then which data should we provide at the top-level?","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
