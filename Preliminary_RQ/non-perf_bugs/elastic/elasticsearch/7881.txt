However when you search on that scroll id it doesn't allow you to use from / size (size is equal to the original query size and you can't use from on the data set).  Instead it just pages to the next (size) number of results until the array is empty.\n\nMy issue comes from a setup where elasticsearch is ingesting data in real time so re-doing the query with from / size every time for pagination can return different results for the same page.  It would be nice to see (from) implemented in the scroll api so the user can just grab a specific range of results from the original scroll request for pagination purposes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
