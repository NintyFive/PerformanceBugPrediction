This can cause issues in certain situations where the host OS has a different user with uid 1000. Mainly, this causes permission issues with the volumes. I can see that using a container orchestration tool could mitigate this problem and could be considered a best practice when using these images?\n\nAbsolutely!  Managing permissions for directories on external volumes is a must.  So those who are looking for a \"quick\" deployment for learning Elastic Stack and blindly following the deployment guides will need to know that they need to chmod/chown the volumes and how to do so.  Not everyone understands the underlying details around Docker, many are looking for the \"Easy Button\", I know I was back in the beginning!\n\nSome notes on system sizing and expectations in terms of Docker Elastic Stack Deployment would be very useful as well.  Either intertwined with the Docker Deployment section or in the overall Elastic Stack System sizing guides (I'd vote for the latter)\n\n\n\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/293657337","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24058#issuecomment-293657337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24058","id":293657337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzY1NzMzNw==","user":{"login":"dliappis","id":1754575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTQ1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1754575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis","html_url":"https://github.com/dliappis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-12T17:53:05Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T17:53:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This has been on my radar for a bit.
