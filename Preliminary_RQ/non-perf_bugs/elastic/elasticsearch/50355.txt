Changing the directions of ORDER BYs - `SELECT gender, MIN(salary) AS min, COUNT(*) AS c, MAX(salary) FROM test_emp GROUP BY gender HAVING c > 1 ORDER BY gender DESC, MAX(salary) ASC` seems to support the above assumption:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    gender     |      min      |       c       |  MAX(salary)  \r\n---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------\r\nnull           |25324.0        |10             |73717.0        \r\nF              |25976.0        |33             |74572.0        \r\nM              |25945.0        |57             |74999.0        \r\n```\r\n\r\nOur tests DO cover this scenario but only partially.\r\nIn `agg-ordering.sql-spec` we have\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT gender, MIN(salary) AS min, COUNT(*) AS c FROM test_emp GROUP BY gender HAVING c > 1 ORDER BY gender, MAX(salary)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich runs ok, but only because ordering by `gender` and ordering by `MAX(salary)` offer the same results for `ASC` ordering. A better test should also return `MAX(salary)` as a projection and should mix `ASC` and `DESC` as directions of `ORDER BY`.","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
