i.e., using a wildcard?\n\nelasticsearch.yml:\n\n```\nnetwork.bind_host: 0\n```\n\nAll interfaces are listening:\n\n```\n $ netstat -p tcp -na | egrep '9200|9300'\ntcp46      0      0  *.9200                 *.*                    LISTEN\ntcp46      0      0  *.9300                 *.*                    LISTEN\n```\n\nWe do not want to necessarily encourage this configuration, however, it would be very helpful to document how to do it.\n\nAs a side note, configuring `network.bind_host: 0.0.0.0` or `0.0.0` or `0.0` also works which is just unexpected. It seems just documenting a lone `0` value would suffice.\n\n_Copied from original issue: elastic/docs#48_\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
