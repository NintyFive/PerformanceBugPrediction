But, for now, it return statistical data in float with a long decimals. Sometimes, I only need a integer result, I have to process the data precise in code logic, that's not such awesome.\n\nSo, could you add a 'precise' option, and we can deal this better. Thanks.\nAnother guys encounter this problem either.http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/numeric-precision-in-terms-stats-facet-td4020390.html\n","closed_by":{"login":"yinchuan","id":2181835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODE4MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2181835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinchuan","html_url":"https://github.com/yinchuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinchuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinchuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinchuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinchuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinchuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinchuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinchuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinchuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinchuan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
