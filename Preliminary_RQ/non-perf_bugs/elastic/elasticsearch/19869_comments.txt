I guess it falls under the community maintained Docker library builds of Elasticsearch from here https://github.com/docker-library/elasticsearch\n\nThe documentation for `elasticsearch-image` dictated that `index.version.created` needs to be set, which is indeed true as leaving it unset gives the same results as setting it to `2030399`.\n\n`kiwionly` (the plugin maintainer) says the code that actually does the checking is in ES itself and not in the plugin source. I've grep'd the source for `elasticsearch-image` and I couldn't see any references to requiring <`2000000` values for `index.version.created`, so I figured I'd ask here.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/239243788","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19869#issuecomment-239243788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19869","id":239243788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTI0Mzc4OA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T18:12:00Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T18:12:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"it sounds like the author of the plugin is relying on 1.x features that have since been removed.
