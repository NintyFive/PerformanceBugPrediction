The job upgrader will leave allocated jobs alone to allow for a seamless rolling upgrade from 6.previous.\r\n\r\nOnce the master is on 7.x I believe the plan is to aggressively upgrade all jobs, even if that means stopping them.  However, this should not really be a problem because you cannot do a rolling upgrade to 7.x until every node is on at least 6.last, and the process of doing a rolling upgrade to 6.last would have reallocated every job already.  And if somebody does a full cluster restart from 6.x to 7.x then every job will need allocating anyway.\r\n\r\n@davidkyle is on holiday until Wednesday, so if you need more detail then he can provide it when he's back.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/444435097","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32905#issuecomment-444435097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32905","id":444435097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDQzNTA5Nw==","user":{"login":"dimitris-athanasiou","id":9351617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTE2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9351617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitris-athanasiou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-05T10:23:19Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T10:23:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Adding a reminder that once migration starts, non-migrated jobs should not be allowed to update in any way including opening.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/505857136","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32905#issuecomment-505857136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32905","id":505857136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTg1NzEzNg==","user":{"login":"davidkyle","id":2353640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTM2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2353640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkyle","html_url":"https://github.com/davidkyle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkyle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkyle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkyle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkyle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkyle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkyle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkyle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkyle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkyle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-26T12:39:48Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T12:39:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This project was completed long ago, the issue can be closed now","performed_via_github_app":null}]
