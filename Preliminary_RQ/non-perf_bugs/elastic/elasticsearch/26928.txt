So far I found out that in JHLRest client documentation, the only possibility is to delete documents by ID, does it mean that I have to fetch all the IDs which meet the condition and delete them?\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add something like delete by query in [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/6.0/java-docs-delete-by-query.html) ? I went to elasticsearch forum and it seems that I'm not the only one who run into this issue:\r\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/t/delete-by-query-using-java-high-level-rest-client/102507\r\n\r\nI tried to find issue for this but I wasn't successful, so in case that this feature request already exists, please mark this as duplicate.\r\n\r\nAlso any hints about temporary solution? Should I find the IDs and then remove it or use the approach mentioned in the elastic forum?","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
