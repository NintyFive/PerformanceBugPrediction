We run against a variety of distributions, I imagine: regular \"zip\" downloads, builds from source, Docker containers, ..., ...\r\n\r\nThe goal from my side is to skip tests if xpack is installed. Or to skip them if it isn't. The [core yaml tests](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/rest-api-spec/src/main/resources/rest-api-spec/test) already have a half dozen tests that fail if xpack is installed. So if you pointed your client at the default distribution they'd fail. We aren't going to add any tests to the core yml tests that fail without xpack installed but we use the yaml tests in a bunch of other places and we will need that feature there.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to wire this up to the Elasticsearch build is to use the distribution which almost always `integ-test-zip`, `oss-zip`, or `zip`. There are some other places where we use `rpm` or `tar` but that is fairly rare. So that data is super available to us and easy to send to the runner. I'm not sure how you'd do it.\r\n\r\nNow that I think about it I wonder if we'd be better off with a way to `skip: distro-flavor: default` or `skip: distro-flavor: oss`. That way we don't care about `rpm` vs `zip` vs `tar`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/393593453","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30933#issuecomment-393593453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30933","id":393593453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzU5MzQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"karmi","id":4790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi","html_url":"https://github.com/karmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T16:33:05Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T16:33:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Now that I think about it I wonder if we'd be better off with a way to skip: distro-flavor: default or skip: distro-flavor: oss.
