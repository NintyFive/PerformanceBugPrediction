the root cause of this appears to be because indexed search templates can be passed without the outer `template` element (which is undocumented).\n\nIf you use the documented syntax:\n\n```\nPUT _search/template/foo\n{\n  \"template\": {\n    \"query\": {\n      \"match_all\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen the `.scripts` index contains the following mapping:\n\n```\n{\n  \".scripts\": {\n    \"mappings\": {\n      \"mustache\": {\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"script\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"enabled\": false\n          },\n          \"template\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"enabled\": false\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `query` field is correctly set to `enabled: false`, so nothing in the query is indexed or even parsed.\n\nHowever, without the outer `template` property:\n\n```\nPUT _search/template/foo\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match_all\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen every element in the query generates a field:\n\n```\n{\n  \".scripts\": {\n    \"mappings\": {\n      \"mustache\": {\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"query\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"match_all\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\"\n              }\n            }\n          },\n          \"script\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"enabled\": false\n          },\n          \"template\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"enabled\": false\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo the solution here is to only accept a `template` property for indexed templates, and a `script` property for indexed scripts.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/160410822","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14837#issuecomment-160410822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14837","id":160410822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDQxMDgyMg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-29T11:56:02Z","updated_at":"2015-11-29T11:56:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Related
