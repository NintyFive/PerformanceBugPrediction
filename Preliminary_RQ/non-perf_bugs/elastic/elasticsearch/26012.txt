It will fail to detect a root histogram aggregation that returns a gazillon number of buckets for instance:\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14046#issuecomment-243341863\r\n.. or multi buckets aggs that create empty buckets.\r\n\r\nThe fact that aggregators use big arrays allocations should be enough to detect deep nested bucket explosion so I have the feeling that adding the static weight of 5kb just fails the big agg faster (and less accurately) than big arrays.\r\nMaybe the accounting of the 5kb could be moved to `InternalMultiBucketAggregation.InternalBucket` creations ? That way we would always detect when a multi bucket aggs creates too many buckets in the final build and maybe even during reduce. I don't know how this would work with incremental reduction of buckets though. Anyway I mark this issue as discuss so that we can evaluate what can be done or not. Bottom line is that bucket explosion can still kill a cluster too easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
