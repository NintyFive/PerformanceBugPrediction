version**: 1.7.5\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n- create a 3-node cluster made of two data nodes and one master node\n- create an index like the following\n\n```\nPOST /test/test/_bulk\n{\"index\":{\"_id\":1}}\n{\"event\": \"BlackBerry device active\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-05-19T01:00:00Z\", \"username\": \"a\"} \n{\"index\":{\"_id\":2}}\n{\"event\": \"BlackBerry device active\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-05-19T02:00:00Z\", \"username\": \"a\"} \n{\"index\":{\"_id\":3}}\n{\"event\": \"BlackBerry device active\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-05-19T03:00:00Z\", \"username\": \"a\"} \n{\"index\":{\"_id\":4}}\n{\"event\": \"BlackBerry device active\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-05-19T04:00:00Z\"} \n{\"index\":{\"_id\":5}}\n{\"event\": \"BlackBerry device active\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-05-19T05:00:00Z\"} \n```\n- use the following query using `scroll` and **send the request to the master node**:\n\n```\nGET /test_/test/_search?scroll=1m&size=2\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match_all\": {}\n  },\n  \"sort\": [\n    {\n      \"username\": {\n        \"order\": \"asc\",\n        \"unmapped_type\": \"string\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"timestamp\": {\n        \"order\": \"asc\",\n        \"unmapped_type\": \"date\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"_source\": [\n    \"username\",\n    \"timestamp\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n- the first result will show documents with IDs 1 and 2\n- the second call `GET /_search/scroll?scroll=1m&scroll_id=cXVlcnlUaGVuRmV0Y2g7NTs1OlAxWnFBTEEtUWRTaEJQLUQzLVNxVnc7NTpOTGVNaENDVFNYMm9wSUdjSkhpeGV3OzQ6UDFacUFMQS1RZFNoQlAtRDMtU3FWdzszOk5MZU1oQ0NUU1gyb3BJR2NKSGl4ZXc7NDpOTGVNaENDVFNYMm9wSUdjSkhpeGV3OzA7` (still **to the master node**) will get docs with IDs 3 and 4\n- the third call will bring back docs with IDs 4 and 5\n- the fourth call will bring back docs with IDs 4 and 5 and so on...\n\nAlmost the same behavior can be observed with sending the requests to a data node instead of a master only node, but the data node doesn't have any data from the index (I used `\"index.routing.allocation.exclude._name\": \"NODE_NAME\"`) to make that data node (where the requests are sent) not hold data for that specific index.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
