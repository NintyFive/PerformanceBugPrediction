I presume it was your only copy and you have no snapshots as backup. You may try to use the [`index.shard.check_index_on_startup`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/index-modules.html#_static_index_settings) but note that it's dangerous so read up carefully. If you have any more questions please ask on our discuss.elastic.co forum. We keep github for issues and feature requests.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
