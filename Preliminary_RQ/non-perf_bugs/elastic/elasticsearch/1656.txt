The documents can also contain \"unmapped\" fields containing arrays of \"user-specified\" objects.\n\nIn this case, in the first document with such an unmapped field, the object contained a field with a null that my calling program had incorrectly turned into {}\n\n(Somewhat less simplified example of documents: https://gist.github.com/1717326)\n\nWhen the next document (with a correct string field) was indexed, the calling thread went into a tight loop forever (ie the index hung, 1 CPU went to 100%). Trying multiple times, more CPUs went to 100%.\n\nWhen I closed down the offending node, one of the other nodes would thrash, until I had closed all the nodes down and restarted them 1-by-1.\n\nAssuming the above is no use (!), when I get some more time I'll try to make my reproduction more and more like my real world case until it fails.
