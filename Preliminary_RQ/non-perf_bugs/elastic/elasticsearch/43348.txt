While these large fields are mostly static for the life span of the index, we frequently push updates to much smaller indexed fields.\r\n\r\nWhenever an update is pushed for one of these documents, the entire document is flagged for reindex. This is problematic due to the fact that our large static fields take a long time to index. \r\n\r\nWe frequently do operations on the scale of 10's to 100's of thousands of documents, so this \"extra\" reindexing is especially problematic for our use case. \r\n\r\nSolr has a feature known as [in-place updates](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/updating-parts-of-documents.html#UpdatingPartsofDocuments-In-PlaceUpdates) which allows updating on certain fields in a document without flagging the entire document for reindex.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for Elasticsearch to implement a feature similar to this so that we can perform our update requests at scale without the need to wait minutes (sometimes even hours) for documents to be indexed and searchable with the new data?","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
