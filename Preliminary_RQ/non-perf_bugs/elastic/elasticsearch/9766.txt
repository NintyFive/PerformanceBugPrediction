It would be great to be able to specify a 'fields' element as part of the nested hit.\n\nNote that Martijn's comment in https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/8153#issuecomment-61798326 suggested it is possible, but I couldn't work out how... \n\nAs a side note, that comment was suggested in relation to disabling the source. In my case I was trying to disable the source for just the nested children, by adding the following to my mapping:\n\n``` json\n\"_source\" : {\n    \"excludes\" : [\"nested_field\", \"nested_field.*\"]\n}\n```\n\nwhich resulted in a null pointer exception...\n\n```\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.elasticsearch.search.fetch.FetchPhase.createNestedSearchHit(FetchPhase.java:295)\n    at org.elasticsearch.search.fetch.FetchPhase.execute(FetchPhase.java:178)\n    at org.elasticsearch.search.fetch.innerhits.InnerHitsFetchSubPhase.hitExecute(InnerHitsFetchSubPhase.java:96)\n    at org.elasticsearch.search.fetch.FetchPhase.execute(FetchPhase.java:190)\n    at org.elasticsearch.search.SearchService.executeFetchPhase(SearchService.java:501)\n    at org.elasticsearch.search.action.SearchServiceTransportAction$17.call(SearchServiceTransportAction.java:452)\n    at org.elasticsearch.search.action.SearchServiceTransportAction$17.call(SearchServiceTransportAction.java:449)\n    at org.elasticsearch.search.action.SearchServiceTransportAction$23.run(SearchServiceTransportAction.java:559)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:744)\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
