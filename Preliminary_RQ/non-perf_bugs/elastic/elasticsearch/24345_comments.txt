When the test was re-enabled, I added a loop to ensure we don't generate input that could hit the behavior difference.\r\n\r\nThis failure is different. Since lucene 5.4, we have done ascii number folding. So any digits in other scripts are replaced by their ascii equivalent. In this test, there are 2 surrogate pairs of numbers, which should be folded to `47`. But the second pair is left unfolded. Looking at the code in `DecimalDigitFilter`, it seems this could only happen if java did not think this character was a number.  I tried these on master and they work fine.  Maybe @jpountz has another idea on what could be wrong?  @dakrone which version of java are you running?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/297551235","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24345#issuecomment-297551235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24345","id":297551235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzU1MTIzNQ==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T21:48:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T21:48:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @dakrone which version of java are you running?\r\n\r\nI'm on 1.8.0_111 (Oracle)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/360834397","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24345#issuecomment-360834397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24345","id":360834397,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDgzNDM5Nw==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-26T16:32:57Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T16:32:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing since it affects 2.x.
