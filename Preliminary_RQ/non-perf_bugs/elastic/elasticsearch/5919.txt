using the benchmark api against multiple nodes through the REST layer, depending on the node hit by the request, a `NullPointerException` might be thrown and returned:\n\n```\n{\n  \"error\" : \"NullPointerException[null]\",\n  \"status\" : 500\n}\n```\n\nThe reason for this is that the [`CompetitionResult#toXContent`](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/bench/CompetitionResult.java#L211) method reads from the `competitionSummary` variable which is `null` when the object gets created through the empty constructor as the `readFrom` method doesn't initialize it based on the received information.\n\nRunning the REST tests with our java runner reproduces this, once nodes are started with `node.bench=true` (relates to #5910).\n","closed_by":{"login":"aleph-zero","id":452273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjI3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/452273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleph-zero","html_url":"https://github.com/aleph-zero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleph-zero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleph-zero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleph-zero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleph-zero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleph-zero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleph-zero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleph-zero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleph-zero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleph-zero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
