Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/NdbfDzZU\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n```\n1. Stop ES. \n2. Enter into data directory: elasticsearch/graylog2/nodes/0/indices\n3. mv graylog_14 graylog_14_new\n4. Start ES.\n```\n\nCluster health becomes yellow. The old index and new index are both shown in the elasticsearch-head plugin.
