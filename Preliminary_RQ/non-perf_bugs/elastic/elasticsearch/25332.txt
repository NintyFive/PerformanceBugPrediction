In regular atomic updates, the entire document is re-indexed internally during the application of the update. However, in this approach, only the fields to be updated are affected and the rest of the documents are not re-indexed internally. Hence, the efficiency of updating in-place is unaffected by the size of the documents that are updated (i.e., number of fields, size of fields, etc.). Apart from these internal differences, there is no functional difference between atomic updates and in-place updates.\r\n\r\nAn atomic update operation is performed using this approach only when the fields to be updated meet these three conditions:\r\n\r\n    are non-indexed (indexed=\"false\"), non-stored (stored=\"false\"), single valued (multiValued=\"false\") numeric docValues (docValues=\"true\") fields;\r\n    the _version_ field is also a non-indexed, non-stored single valued docValues field; and, \r\n    copy targets of updated fields, if any, are also non-indexed, non-stored single valued numeric docValues fields.\r\n\r\nTo use in-place updates, add a modifier to the field that needs to be updated. The content can be updated or incrementally increased.\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to see if ES will provide this feature or not.","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
