This is an important feature for huge scale systems. Backup and Restore with index level granularity would be great. At least the ability to restore only selected index to a point in time. \n\nWe have TBs of data stored in Elastic Search and very recently we faced the \"Split Brain\" couple of times and couple of indices became inconsistent and wouldn't get assigned in any of the replicas we had and hence the cluster was in Red. I had to CURL delete those huge indices and reindex all the data back which took days for me.\n\nI already snapshot the disks, but again, the restore would have taken more time than the reindexing option because of the huge volume and moreover restoring the disk would have required a lot of down time.\n\nPlease make this a higher priority because this would help a lot of souls.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/25587768","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3070#issuecomment-25587768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3070","id":25587768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTg3NzY4","user":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-03T00:06:42Z","updated_at":"2013-10-03T00:06:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I added the new issue #3826 to track work on the first phase of the snapshot/restore API.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/41397044","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3070#issuecomment-41397044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3070","id":41397044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzk3MDQ0","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-25T14:17:04Z","updated_at":"2014-04-25T14:17:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we can close this issue as snapshot and restore api was released with 1.0.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
