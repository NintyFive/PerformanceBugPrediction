In the future, please ask these question on our [discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/) where we can provide better support. \r\n\r\nTo address your specific questions\r\n- While the code for X-Pack is available in a public repository, we do not claim that it is \"Open Source\": https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack/open\r\n- Security remains a commercial feature: https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions\r\n- The default distribution of Elasticsearch includes all of X-Pack, but the default license is \"basic\" which does not include security.\r\n- You can activate a free trial of the commercial features via Kibana or the API: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-overview/6.3/license-management.html\r\n\r\nSince there is no specific bug identifed in your issue, I'm going to close this ticket.
