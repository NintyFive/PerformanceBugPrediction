User is giving toDate and fromDate in the input and we are querying the nested document (date field is present in the nested document). But we have a use case where we need to return a field of outer document if none of the inner document is matching with give date range for that outer document. \r\n\r\nPlease take below data example\r\nDocument1: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"myId\": \"1\",\r\n  \"nestedDocumentData\": [\r\n    {\r\n     \"myInnerDocumentDate\": \"2017-06-06\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"myInnerDocumentDate\": \"2017-07-07\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"myInnerDocumentDate\": \"2017-08-08\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocument2: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"myId\": \"2\",\r\n  \"nestedDocumentData\": [\r\n    {\r\n     \"myInnerDocumentDate\": \"2017-06-06\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf user input date range as 7/1(1st July) to 8/1(1st August) then output should be myId : 2 which is second document since document 1 has matching date range with given input (In nested document of Document1, 2 nested document has date 7/7 and 8/8).\r\n\r\nIf user input date range as 6/1 to 7/15 then output should be empty since 6/6 is present in the second document and 7/7 is present in the first document and both the document has AT-LEAST one nested document which is matching the range. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
