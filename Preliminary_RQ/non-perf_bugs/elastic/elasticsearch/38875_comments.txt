I see uses by the LicenseService, DataFrame, IndexLifecycleService, and Rollup.\r\n\r\nLicenseService is an AbstractLifecycleService and shuts the SchedulerEngine down. I am not seeing DataFrame or Rollup shutting it down. IndexLifecycleService may have a race where an extra scheduler engine could get created. I'll pick up working on this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
