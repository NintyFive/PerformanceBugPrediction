If you want to match `date` accurately you'll need to use the type `date` in your mapping, otherwise the query is analyzed and the default analyzer removes the punctuation (`-`, `/`, ...). We reserve github for bugs and feature requests so I hope you don't mind that I close this issue. We can continue to discuss your mapping and how mappings and queries work in general but the forum is better suited for this kind of discussion. Please open a topic on the [discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) if you have more questions and me or someone from the community should be able to help you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
