We've seen people in our [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/question-about-the-future-release-of-es-that-incorporate-lucene-7-0/80163) mention they have regression tests that include ordering and my own history leads me to believe that while these users will be the minority, they are not terribly uncommon and they often have extensive UAT / and long UAT cycles, which is why they built the tests in the first place.  For these users, dropping classic similarity is going to mean one of 2 things: simply avoiding the upgrade entirely and sticking around on 5.x for as long as possible or upgrading a test environment and then re-engaging their long UAT cycles, potentially failing them and having to go edit queries, etc as they go through these cycles.\r\n2. To a much lesser extent, I've anecdotally heard some users with a fixed catalog of data include the numeric score calculations of some specific queries in their regression tests.\r\n3. There are people that are convinced TF-IDF is better for their data+queries than BM25.  I've heard this a number times: sometimes where the user has done a lot of testing and shown that TF-IDF is better in one way or another for them and sometimes not.  I also believe TF-IDF also has more literature around it, is taught in more schools, and is generally a bit easier to understand (the formula is more or less in the name) so there may be some resistance purely due to how understood the two are relative to one another.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I think that the vast majority of users do not fall in any of these categories and I've seen BM25 does perform better in the vast majority of UAT (especially in text search) and is built on sound principals avoiding keyword stuffing, etc.  Given that Lucene is dropping `coord`, I'm not sure what we can do for users falling in categories 1 and 2 other than brace them for the impact ASAP.  For users in the third category, one thing I was thinking was the possibility of pulling classic similarity out into a plugin that we could bootstrap for the community (and put it in the community's hands to support).  No matter what, we also need to accept that for some portion of users, this change will delay (to change queries / go through UAT again) or entirely keep them from upgrading (if they decide they \"need\" to keep the old behavior).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/308667638","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23208#issuecomment-308667638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23208","id":308667638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODY2NzYzOA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-15T08:40:28Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T08:40:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm wondering whether the scripted similarity feature that we discussed a couple times could be a good workaround rather than creating a plugin.

I understand that coords were a work around for the fact that TF-IDF isn't great at favoring documents that matches all terms over a document that only matches a single term multiple time. I also understand that BM25 has better TF saturation which naturally helps with those scenarios. Unfortunately, I have the challenging goal of customizing the classic similarity algorithm in Es7 (Lucene8) such as the resulting scores are the same as Es5 (Lucene6, when coords were still a thing). I was originally hopping that coords could somewhat be re-implemented externally (or through the scripting features), but the concept of coords is so entrangled with the various Lucene scoring classes (boolean scorers, weights, parsers) that its proven to be much more challenging than I originally hopped.
