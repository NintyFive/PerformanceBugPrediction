This is super error prone and requires String parsing. We should on each level `index` -> `shard` know exactly what to expect and don't use directory listings which are expensive and subject to change. There should be a metadata file on each level that is atomically written that we open and see what we have to expect no matter of what's on the FS.\n","closed_by":{"login":"areek","id":753679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/753679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek","html_url":"https://github.com/areek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
