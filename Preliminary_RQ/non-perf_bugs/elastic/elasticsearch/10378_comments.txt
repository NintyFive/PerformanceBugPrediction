It took me a week to finish indexing 400 indices and the remaining 100 seem to be taking much longer to create (~5 minutes per index at the start and ~10-30 minutes now). Why does the amount of existing indices affect new index creation? E.g. you wouldn't expect writing to a file to be slower based on the amount of folders on the drive (unless there's fragmentation which seems like it shouldn't start to be a problem at 1K indices).\n\nDegraded search warm-up is perfectly reasonable, but creating the index I expected to perform consistently.
