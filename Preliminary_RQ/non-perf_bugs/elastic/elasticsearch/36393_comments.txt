We are already taking care that Elasticsearch refuses to start if this file has been tampered with (this is what you have experienced) and we have not only the file size check but several others in place that ensure the integrity of this file. However, It can always happen that e.g. due to a misconfiguration this file is invalid. E.g. nothing is stopping you from creating a file with that name with a text editor and saving some text in it (similarly for misconfiguration of the JVM parameters), or telling some other program to write its log files to that file and then starting Elasticsearch. You cannot really prevent such scenarios and that's why we have those checks in place to fail early, refuse to start and tell you that there is a serious problem with integrity.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/447386375","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36393#issuecomment-447386375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36393","id":447386375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzM4NjM3NQ==","user":{"login":"dsshane","id":15656251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjU2MjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15656251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsshane","html_url":"https://github.com/dsshane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsshane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsshane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsshane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsshane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsshane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsshane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsshane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsshane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsshane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-14T16:59:08Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T16:59:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@danielmitterdorfer Thanks for your help and your comment.\r\n\r\n But I am some kind of disagree with what you said. It will be a very simple change. If -Xlog:gc is set, but there is no output file, just provide a default location under the log_dir. And actually, I don't agree that this is a misconfiguration by not providing a GC log location.  For a robust system, it should take care of this internally. Further more, why the GC log goes to the **system critical file** but not other file(i.e,  log file)? ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
