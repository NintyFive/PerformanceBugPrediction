Filing to track progress since this will likely come up in the future.  Currently, there is no validation on the values of the privileges set when creating roles.  So it's possible for users to have a typo on the privilege names and the role will still get added/accepted by the API.\n\n```\n{\n  \"indices\": [\n    {\n      \"names\": [ \"test\",\".kibana\" ],\n      \"privileges\": [ \"al\" ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n```\n{\n  \"role\": {\n    \"created\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt will be nice if we can validate this and throw back and exception (or maybe even include the list of allowable values for privileges in the exception, etc..).\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"bizybot","id":902768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjc2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/902768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot","html_url":"https://github.com/bizybot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
