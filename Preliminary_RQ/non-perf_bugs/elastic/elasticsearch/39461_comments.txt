Perhaps path.logs in  an existing elasticsearch.yml? The rpm package uses `/var/log/elasticsearch` as the logs path. So the fact elasticsearch is trying to write to `/usr/share/elasticsearch/logs` indicates you have something changing that.\r\n\r\nSince we have tests for all our packages and one of the many checks is this log file location, I'm going to close this issue. If you are still having issues, please post a thread in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co). There's an active community in the  that should be able to help debug issues like this. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
