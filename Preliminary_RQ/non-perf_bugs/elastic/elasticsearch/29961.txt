The customer was building a comment system against a parent child schema where child docs are comments/tags off read only parent docs. Users would be restricted by DLS to what parent docs they can see and comment on and each user would also only be allowed to edit their own created comments. \r\n\r\n# Feature\r\nProvide some security related ingest processors for an ingest pipeline that would allow users to perform writes to indices that have special security permissions set to allow a method for users with DLS/FLS restrictions to perform controlled writes to indices.\r\n\r\nSo a privilege on an index that said “allow write, but only via pipeline XYZ” and then allowed the cluster admin to write a script processor that references the user’s roles, they’d get something loosely like an insert/update trigger in SQL.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pcsanwald","id":163306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/163306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald","html_url":"https://github.com/pcsanwald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
