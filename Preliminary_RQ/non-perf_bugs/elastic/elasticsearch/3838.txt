For example, when an \"and\" filter has no elements. Ignoring a filter is different compared to matching on all or matching on none, because an and filter with no elements should simply be ignored in the context of a bool filter for example, regardless if its used within a `must` or a `must_not` filter.\n\nWe should be consistent in our codebase when handling these use case.
