like removing the `path` option for two reasons:\n- The more configuration metadata fields have, the harder they are to deal with.\n- It removes questions such as \"if there are both a timestamp to extract in my document, and a timpestamp in the indexing request (`?timestamp=...`), who wins?\"\n\nIf we consider that the `_timestamp` field is only useful in the context of the `_ttl` feature (eg.
