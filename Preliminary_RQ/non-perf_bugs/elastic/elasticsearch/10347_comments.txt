Right now the context is an enum, perhaps it should be based on opaque strings (internally we'll sill use the same constants that the enum already captures.\n- we can still have a \"capture all\" context (say `other`) that can be configured like all the others and have compile/execute methods overloaded so we'll also have those without the passed in context (in which case the ctx will default to `other`).... we can perhaps mark it as deprecated and remove it in 2.0 (so from 2.0 ctx will be a required param)?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/88474531","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10347#issuecomment-88474531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10347","id":88474531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4NDc0NTMx","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-01T13:12:09Z","updated_at":"2015-04-01T13:12:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree with @uboness on making things more flexible, maybe we could just use the plugin name though instead of having plugins declare potentially multiple additional contexts (think of conflicting ones as well).
