The query was this:\n\n```\n{\n        \"flt\": {\n            \"fields\": [\n            \"comment\"\n        ],\n        \"like_text\": \"FFFdfds\",\n        \"fuzziness\": \"4\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nthe result was this:\n\n> ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException[Can't get similarity from fuzziness [4]]; }]\n\nBut the query works fro values 1 and 2.\nSo I guess either the documentation is mistaken or the implementation. We were previously using the edit distances of up to 4-5 characters. After the update we're kind of lost for now :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
