I was working on #18703, I discovered a bad behavior when people don't provide AWS key/secret as part as their `elasticsearch.yml` but rely on SysProps or env. variables...\n\nIn [`InternalAwsS3Service#getClient(...)`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/d4366f8493ac8d2f7091404ffd346e4f3c0f9af9/plugins/repository-s3/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cloud/aws/InternalAwsS3Service.java#L76-L141), we have:\n\n``` java\n        Tuple<String, String> clientDescriptor = new Tuple<>(endpoint, account);\n        AmazonS3Client client = clients.get(clientDescriptor);\n```\n\nBut if people don't provide credentials, `account` is `null`.\n\nEven if it actually could work, I think that we should use the `AWSCredentialsProvider` we create later on and extract from it the `account` (AWS KEY actually) and then use it as the second value of the tuple.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
