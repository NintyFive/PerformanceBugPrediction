That said, you cannot change the `_id` of a document through a script. I suppose that AUwKuP4ndtjQr1ZnsG_U is the auto generated id for your document, since you didn't specify one in the url, and A0001nithya the result of the script. \nNot sure about the last bit on the my_message field, maybe you can share some more details on the mailing list around it, that sounds like it should work.\n\nIn general, and especially if you want to modify your ids, I would pre-process your documents before sending them to elasticsearch to be honest, so that they have the right id from the beginning.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
