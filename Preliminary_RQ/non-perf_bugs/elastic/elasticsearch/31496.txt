we use https://github.com/randomizedtesting/ for running the tests. \r\n\r\nThe Gradle plugin calls into ant  to do the heavy lifting.\r\nIt also replaces the Gradle `Test` task that the java plugin creates ( called `test` ) with it's own `RandomizedTestingTask` . This proved to be problematic, see  #31324, and might no longer be possible in some future Gradle release.   \r\nAlso, running the tests in parallel with the ant runner is independent from Gradle and  does not honor Gradle `--max-workers` setting, which makes it hard to make other parts of Gradle run in parallel as it can lead to too many threads being created. \r\n\r\nIt _is_ possible to use the reandmizedtesting runner i.e. `@RunWith` and run the tests with the Grade test runner. This proposal is to replace the `ant` part and _not_ the runner.
