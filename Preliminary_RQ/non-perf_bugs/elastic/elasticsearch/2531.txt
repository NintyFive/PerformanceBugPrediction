the most recent occasion being after one of the servers in the cluster was unexpectedly rebooted by Amazon.\n\nWe have been able to reproduce this locally using multiple Vagrant boxes - although not every time (2/3 attempts will reproduce this)\n\nThis bug seems very similar / the same as https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/elasticsearch/percolator/elasticsearch/VZjslNupBNY/Q3VFfXDqt6sJ\n## Steps to reproduce:\n- Have a cluster of Elastic Search servers\n- Index some Percolator queries\n- Test that each node returns the same response to a percolation request\n- Forcefully reboot one of the servers (e.g. sudo reboot -f)\n- Wait until the rebooted node rejoins the cluster\n- Test each node returns the same response\n## Expected Result:\n- Every node returns the same (correct) response\n## Actual Result:\n- The restarted node returns no matched percolation queries, despite the cluster being in the healthy (green) state and the expected number of docs showing in the _percolator index.\n- Sometimes the correct result is returned by the restarted node for a short time, and _then_, after a few seconds, starts returning no matches.\n- Restarting Elastic Search on the node seems to fix this.\n- Nothing unusual appears in the log files.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
