The `false` option for the `dynamic` setting will still accept documents that have fields which are not in the mapping (i.e. it will not throw an error) but it will not index those fields so you won't be able to search those fields. When you GET the document you will however still see the new fields in the `_source` field as Elasticsearch does not modify the `_source` field.
