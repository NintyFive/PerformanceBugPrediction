Set initial settings in elasticsearch.yml:\n\n```\nthreadpool:\n    search:\n        type: fixed\n        size: 72\n        queue_size: -1\n```\n\nb. Run a large of queries in parallel, look out for EsRejectedExecutionException.\n\nc. Raise the queue_size to a huge number:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_cluster/settings -d '{\n      \"transient\" : {\n          \"threadpool.search.queue_size\" : 1000000\n      }\n  }'\n```\n\nd. Run a bunch more queries in parallel, no exceptions this time.\n\ne. Change back to -1 via cluster settings, the exceptions restart.\n\nVerified with 0.90.2.\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
