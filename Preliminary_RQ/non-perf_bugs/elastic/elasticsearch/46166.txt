(and it's open source variant OKD) run containers with an arbitrary user id which we've already added support for in [elasticsearch-docker#125](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker/pull/125) (see also the old issue [elasticsearch-docker#114](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker/issues/114)).\r\n\r\nHowever, `USER` needs to be additionally specified to a numeric value, according to the [OpenShift guidelines](https://docs.okd.io/latest/creating_images/guidelines.html).\r\n\r\nThe current Elasticsearch Dockerfile doesn't specifically set the `USER`, inherits `0` from the parent image (`centos:7`) and later inside the [entrypoint script](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/9c6d9a904965f7d1f12055a1bfd65be098804369/distribution/docker/src/docker/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh#L7-L16) switches to user `1000` to start Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this doesn't work in OpenShift. Unless the [anyuid SCC](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/manage_scc.html#enable-dockerhub-images-that-require-root) property is set in OpenShift/OKD, the container won't be allowed to start.\r\nIn addition to that, [Elastic Cloud on k8s](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/index.html) sets the property [runAsNonRoot: true](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/blob/5196e364971cfce211a0d9bafd11411d30741985/operators/config/e2e/batch_job.yaml#L29) which just won't work, without specifying a non privileged `USER`, on OpenShift/OKD.\r\n\r\n@josgonza-rh raised a [PR](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/45376) to set `USER 1000` in the Dockerfile but we decided to close it and open this issue instead because explicitly setting `USER 1000` requires a few changes tracked in this issue:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Remove all user switching code in the [entrypoint](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/distribution/docker/src/docker/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh).\r\n- [ ] Remove the [TAKE_FILE_OWNERSHIP](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#_notes_for_production_use_and_defaults) feature (code [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/9c6d9a904965f7d1f12055a1bfd65be098804369/distribution/docker/src/docker/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh#L93-L98)). This feature was historically requested to assist with bind mount permission issues, but not sure how much usage it still has.\r\n- [ ] Adjust docs as required, e.g. removing `TAKE_FILE_OWNERSHIP`.\r\n- [ ] Add necessary tests to ensure the entrypoint changes don't break existing functionality.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pugnascotia","id":8696382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTYzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8696382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia","html_url":"https://github.com/pugnascotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
