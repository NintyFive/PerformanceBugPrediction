Technically it would be equivalent in terms of matching and this field would be compatible with the `more_like_this` query. It is also possible to use the `term_vectors` API to build a custom boolean query using the same logic than the `mlt` query. `keyword` fields should be used for exact matching,  for this reason we are going to close this issue.
