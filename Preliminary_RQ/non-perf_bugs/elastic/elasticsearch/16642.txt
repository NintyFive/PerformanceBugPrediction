So it is not possible to do following:\n- Bucket aggregations on them (a very common use case) as a sub aggregation of  the nested one. For example If multiple lawyers are assigned to cases of different types and each assignment captures his/her hours spent and report needs to be total hours by lawyer by case type. It is impossible to do so. Using reverse_nested and back will not produce desired results \n- Filter on owner's fields within aggregations. \n- Metrics aggregations on owner's fields are a little less useful as there will be double-counting but often are necessary as well\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
