On 2.4, the wildcard search+analyze_wildcard:true works against both analyzed and not_analyzed field, but on 5.x, it only works against keyword field.  (Certainly, for wildcard searches, it makes more sense to run against a keyword field, but this represents a change in behavior between the major versions).\r\n\r\nQuick chat with @jpountz revealed that there was indeed a change in behavior between the versions where we now match the wildcard expression against a single token.  It will be helpful to document this somewhere, maybe here (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/breaking_50_search_changes.html)?","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
