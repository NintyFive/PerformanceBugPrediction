I DO NOT know the effects of this on a server or other machine where you don't have a backup of this data in case it doesn't work... \n\nI installed 2.1 and later found out the app I was trying to work on required 1.7.3 and tried to downgrade. I received this error \n\n`[ERROR][gateway.local.state.shards] [Lilandra Neramani] failed to read local state (started shards), exiting...\norg.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchException: unexpected field in shard state [index_uuid]`\n\nAfter trying many things that didnt work, including the above solution, I resorted to simply deleting the entire data folder for elasticsearch and rebuilding it. `rm -rf /usr/local/var/elasticsearch`. Then I just ran a reindex which rebuilt that folder `rake search:reindex` and everything worked just fine. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/166267893","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10565#issuecomment-166267893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10565","id":166267893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjI2Nzg5Mw==","user":{"login":"dlamichhane","id":365507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTUwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/365507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamichhane","html_url":"https://github.com/dlamichhane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamichhane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamichhane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamichhane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamichhane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamichhane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamichhane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamichhane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamichhane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlamichhane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-21T10:42:31Z","updated_at":"2015-12-21T10:42:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/173319202","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10565#issuecomment-173319202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10565","id":173319202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzMxOTIwMg==","user":{"login":"cerealkill","id":2923413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjM0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2923413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerealkill","html_url":"https://github.com/cerealkill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerealkill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerealkill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerealkill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerealkill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerealkill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerealkill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerealkill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerealkill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cerealkill/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-20T18:38:55Z","updated_at":"2016-01-20T18:38:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you @skylarmb .\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/182895610","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10565#issuecomment-182895610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10565","id":182895610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mjg5NTYxMA==","user":{"login":"ckc6cz","id":10505527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTA1NTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10505527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckc6cz","html_url":"https://github.com/ckc6cz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckc6cz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckc6cz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckc6cz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckc6cz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckc6cz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckc6cz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckc6cz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckc6cz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckc6cz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-11T14:51:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T14:51:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Not an issue, just me being stupid.
