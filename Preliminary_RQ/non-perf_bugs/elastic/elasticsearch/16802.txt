The design uses a read/write lock per table segment and a lock around the global linked for LRU ordering.\n\nThere are a few concerns that might be worth addressing. First is that a r/w lock is expensive, often much more than an exclusive lock, and its usage per read is probably best replaced with a ConcurrentHashMap. Second is that the LRU lock is a throttling point, as all accesses contend on it. Third is that `computeIfAbsent` is racy by allowing redundant computations with last insert wins. Fourth is that LRU is sub-optimal for search workloads, where frequency is a more insightful metric.\n\nThe easiest (and biased) solution is to adopt [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine). Alternatively a big win would come from integrating [TinyLFU](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Efficiency#search) into the existing cache. This would increase the hit rate, thereby reducing I/O and GC allocations, resulting in improved latencies.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ben-manes","id":378614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODYxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/378614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes","html_url":"https://github.com/ben-manes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-manes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
