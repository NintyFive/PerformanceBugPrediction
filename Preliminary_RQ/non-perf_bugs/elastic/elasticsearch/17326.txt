But when I try to set it dynamically, ES emits a warning which says the setting is ignored.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. start ES 2.2.0.\n2. issue this update -\n\ncurl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_cluster/settings' -d '{\n    \"transient\" : {\n        \"index.merge.scheduler.max_thread_count\": 1\n    }\n}'\n1.
