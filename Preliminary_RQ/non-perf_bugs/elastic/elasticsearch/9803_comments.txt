The options available in aliases are intended for enforcing rules to give the illusion of multi-tenancy in a shared index.\n\nA default sort is just a preference (one of many that could be requested) and then raises the question of eg what happens if the user specifies another sort order? should it be allowed or denied? What if they want to apply a secondary sort etc. And who knows what other use-case specific configurations could be requested?\n\nThis feels like it should be applied in a proxy layer in front of Elasticsearch instead.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
