You can certainly use `highlight_query` in the mean time if you find searching for `**` to be slower than `*`. At a minimum we need to update the docs page for highlighting.\n\nThe \"incorrect\" highlighting you describe is actually the expected behavior of the fast vector highlighter. It identifies hits, picks the right snippet based on the hits, and then expands the snippet forwards and backwards looking for word breaks. It doesn't go back to the list of hits when it does the seeking. IIRC the experimental-highlighter did do that, but no one has updated it to work with 2.0 so, yeah.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/262984997","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17500#issuecomment-262984997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17500","id":262984997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Mjk4NDk5Nw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-25T15:53:58Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T15:53:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed in favour of #21621","performed_via_github_app":null}]
