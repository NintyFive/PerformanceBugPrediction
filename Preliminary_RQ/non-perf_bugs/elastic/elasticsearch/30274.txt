This behavior conflicts with what's described in the dynamic templates documentation:\r\n\r\n> New templates can be appended to the end of the list with the PUT mapping API. If a new template has the same name as an existing template, it will replace the old version.\r\n\r\nIf we're happy with the behavior described in the documentation, we should update the mapping merge logic to obey those semantics.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease see the following gist: https://gist.github.com/jtibshirani/52d913410957b502d6037f02d1f1340a\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
