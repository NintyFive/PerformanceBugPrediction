It wasn't working back when this issue was opened, therefore we changed the github url where we get the archive from. Unfortunately the structure of the archive is slightly different when downloaded from the new url, since it contains a subfolder that has a slightly different naming, which we relied on in order to strip that part of the path from every zip entry and put all the files directly under the _site folder. To be more specific, the archives contain now a `repo-master` top-level folder, while using the other address the top-level folder is `user-repo-hash`.\n\nWe would like to keep the new adopted url format (user/repo/archive/master.zip) since it seems more future-proof, but we need to adapt the zip extraction process too in order for this to work properly.\n\nReopening this issue as I'm working it, a fix will follow.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
