reproduce \n- set `cluster.routing.allocation.node_initial_primaries_recoveries` to any value lower than `cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries`\n- start cluster with two nodes (node1 and node2)\n- create an index with 1000 shards and 0 replicas:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test -d '{\"settings\": {\"number_of_shards\":1000, \"number_of_replicas\":0}}' \n```\n- shutdown node2\n- enable allocation filtering to exclude node1:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_cluster/settings -d '{\"transient\": {\"cluster.routing.allocation.exclude._id\": \"...id of node1...\"}}'\n```\n- at this time half of the shards should be `STARTED` and another half should be `UNASSIGNED`\n- start node2\n- observe that instead of initializing `node_initial_primaries_recoveries` shards on node2 first, elasticsearch is moving shards from node1 to node2\n\nExpected behavior: until all local shards are initialized, all `node_initial_primaries_recoveries` shards should be initializing locally and the rest (`node_concurrent_recoveries` - `node_initial_primaries_recoveries`) can be used for relocation.\n\nImpact: as a result of this bug, sometimes relocating primaries from another node can take over local recovery and a cluster may take very long time to get to green status\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
