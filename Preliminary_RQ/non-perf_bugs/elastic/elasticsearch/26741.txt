windows to the set of platforms we verify packaging correctness on.\r\n\r\n[The BATS tests](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/c760eec0541a8fc564da997014baddfc6ea6baed/qa/vagrant/src/test/resources/packaging/tests) will be rewritten in java/groovy so they'll be portable on all test platforms. We'd like to build these tests into a jar on the host and then execute the jar in the vm. Depending on how they're written it may make more sense to run them as a gradle task.\r\n\r\nBecause of licensing issues, we can't make a windows vagrant image publicly available. Users will be able to specify a windows image to use when running these tests, and the tests will include checks for correct java version, etc.\r\n\r\nThis was from a discussion with @tlrx @rjernst @nik9000 @jasontedor ","closed_by":{"login":"andyb-elastic","id":29205940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjA1OTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29205940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic","html_url":"https://github.com/andyb-elastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
