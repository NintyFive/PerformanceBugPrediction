I'm running an upsert script which inserts records within a nested field of a document.\n\n\"if (ctx._source.records.contains(data)){ctx.op='none'; }else {ctx._source.records+=data;}\"\n\nI am running the following script on a 1.4.2 cluster and it works perfectly using the 1.4.4 client Java API.\n\nHowever since I have upgraded on the new 1.4.4 ElasticSearch Cluster Server, the script is no longer working, documents are not deleted and reindexed. I think that might be related to the groovy modifications that were made in 1.4.3 server.\n\nThank you\n","closed_by":{"login":"phil2396","id":2754722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTQ3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2754722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phil2396","html_url":"https://github.com/phil2396","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phil2396/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phil2396/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phil2396/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phil2396/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phil2396/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phil2396/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phil2396/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phil2396/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phil2396/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
