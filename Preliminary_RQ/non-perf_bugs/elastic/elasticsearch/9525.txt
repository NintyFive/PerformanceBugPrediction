This means that your synonym analyzer will never receive a multiword synonym. Instead of seeing United States as a single string, the analyzer will receive United and States separately.\"\n\nThough using simple_query_string flags we can specify using a subset of flags not containing the WHITESPACE flag which would effectively overcome the challenge of using query_string with multiword synonyms mentioned in the above documentation.\n\nSo perhaps worth rephrasing this to leave the door open to use of simple_query_string when searching using multiword synonyms?\n\nSee scenario below\n\n```\nDELETE my_index\n\nPUT /my_index\n{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"analysis\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"my_synonym_filter\": {\n          \"type\": \"synonym\",\n          \"synonyms\": [\n            \"kerningenieur,ingeniero nuclear,ingegnere nucleare,ingenieur nucleaire=>nuclear engineer\"\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      \"analyzer\": {\n        \"my_synonyms\": {\n          \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",\n          \"filter\": [\n            \"lowercase\",\n            \"my_synonym_filter\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT my_index/_mapping/job\n{\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"title\":{\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"analyzer\": \"my_synonyms\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nPUT my_index/job/1\n{\n    \"title\":\"ingenieur nucleaire\"\n}\n\nPOST my_index/_search\n{ \n  \"query\":{\n      \"simple_query_string\" : {\n        \"query\" : \"nuclear engineer\",\n        \"analyzer\": \"my_synonyms\",\n        \"fields\": [\"title\",\"_all\"],\n        \"flags\" : \"OR|AND|PREFIX\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n{\n   \"took\": 2,\n   \"timed_out\": false,\n   \"_shards\": {\n      \"total\": 5,\n      \"successful\": 5,\n      \"failed\": 0\n   },\n   \"hits\": {\n      \"total\": 1,\n      \"max_score\": 0.07795621,\n      \"hits\": [\n         {\n            \"_index\": \"my_index\",\n            \"_type\": \"job\",\n            \"_id\": \"1\",\n            \"_score\": 0.07795621,\n            \"_source\": {\n               \"title\": \"ingenieur nucleaire\"\n            }\n         }\n      ]\n   }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
