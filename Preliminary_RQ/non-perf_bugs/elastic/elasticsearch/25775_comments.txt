There will be a stack trace in the server logs relating to that ClassCastException, could you paste it here so we can fix the bug in the validation?\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a bug in the validation your request should fail because the `*_bucket` aggregations need to be direct-siblings to the multi-bucket aggregations they are working on, if you move your `monthly_average` aggregation so its a sub-aggregation to your `by_frequency` `nested` aggregations an a sibling to the `by_frequency` `date_histogram` aggregation, and change the `buckets+path` to `by_frequency>total>total` I think it might work (although depending on the cause of the `ClassCastException` you may still hit that).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/316101780","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25775#issuecomment-316101780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25775","id":316101780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjEwMTc4MA==","user":{"login":"kujon","id":503380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzM4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/503380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon","html_url":"https://github.com/kujon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-18T15:30:17Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T15:30:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The
