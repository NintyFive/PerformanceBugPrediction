The use of the Java [security manager configuration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting-security.html#modules-scripting-other-layers) is not immediately apparent. My reasoning is that the principle of least surprise trumps a convenience for specific local admin procedures, especially in the area of security.\r\n\r\nThat said, even a closed ticket is a good Google target for other people who wonder the same thing. :smile: I'm fine with closing the issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
