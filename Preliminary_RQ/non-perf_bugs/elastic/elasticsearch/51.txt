This is handy, for example, to map the same string type, once `analyzed` and one `not_analyzed`. For example:\n\n```\n{\n    person : {\n        properties : {\n            \"name\" : {\n                type : \"multi_field\",\n                \"fields\" : {\n                    \"name\" : {type: \"string\", index : \"analyzed\", store : \"yes\"},\n                    \"not_analyzed\" : {type: \"string\", index : \"not_analyzed\"},\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above example, the `name` mapping is a multi field mapping. The `name` within the `multi_field` mapping is the \"default\" mapping (and used as if it was mapped regularly). The `not_analyzed` name is accessed through `name.not_analyzed`, and it won't be analyzed.\n\nA special case is when merging, upgrading core type mapping into multi field mapping if the new mapping set for this property is now multi mapping.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
