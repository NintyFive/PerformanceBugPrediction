Importantly every OS that we support has a feature for this. This is distinguished from the processors setting wherein even if you use OS functionality for thread affinity, the JVM does not know that it is limited in the cores in the machine that it would be scheduled on, so we have to explicitly tell Elasticsearch to pretend that it only has a certain number of cores available to it. Additionally, not every OS has functionality for setting the thread affinity of a process (e.g., for macOS there is not a CLI tool like `taskset` while there is a thread affinity API; this does not help end-users).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/415192388","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33068#issuecomment-415192388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33068","id":415192388,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTE5MjM4OA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-22T21:48:37Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T21:48:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/415248312","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33068#issuecomment-415248312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33068","id":415248312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTI0ODMxMg==","user":{"login":"yanjunh","id":1834562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQ1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1834562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanjunh","html_url":"https://github.com/yanjunh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanjunh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanjunh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanjunh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanjunh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanjunh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanjunh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanjunh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanjunh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanjunh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-23T01:36:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T01:36:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes it's different from Processors override in the way that OS always reports the correct volume size.
