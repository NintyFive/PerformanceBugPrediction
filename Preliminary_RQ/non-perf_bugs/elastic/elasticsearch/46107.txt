See that issue for most of the context.\r\n\r\nIf we do decide to proceed with the proposal in that issue in one form or another, we then need to consider how to expose such deprecation indices to the upgrade assistant. Do we want to treat exposing them as part of the `/_migration/deprecations` endpoint, or do we want the upgrade assistant to access the deprecation indices directly (through an API on top of them as part of being system indices)?","closed_by":{"login":"jakelandis","id":976291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjI5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/976291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis","html_url":"https://github.com/jakelandis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
