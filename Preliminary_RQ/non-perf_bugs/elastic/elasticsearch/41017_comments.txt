To Elasticsearch, it is like an application index from any other application.

The idea behind system indices is they are implemented behind the scenes as indices, but not exposed to users via the usual index APIs (index, search, snapshot/restore, etc.). Instead, for each system index there will be an associated plugin that exposes only the APIs necessary for that system index to serve its purpose. The .kibana index would be a system index, and there would be `kibana_system_index` plugin that dictates the APIs of the .kibana index, including the restore properties. That plugin can then validate on restore whether or not the index being restored matches any requirements the `kibana_system_index` needs to enforce (e.g., mapping version, etc.).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
