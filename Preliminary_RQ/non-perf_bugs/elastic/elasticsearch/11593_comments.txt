The issue for me was I was trying to revert the change with\n\ncurl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/test-*/_settings' -d '\n{\n    \"index\" : {\n        \"blocks\": {\n            \"write\": false,\n            \"metadata\": false\n        }\n    }\n}'\n\nwhich appears to attempt ta change the write block first, which tosses the metadata exception. If I break it into two separate queries, then I was able to revert.
