Unfortunately I had indeed forgot about #21170, and since we have no tests for any downstream build tools (including gradle and maven!), I did not catch this earlier.  It is possible to fix this by reverting #24056, but will also require some additional change to find and remove the `exclusions` tag added by gradle.
