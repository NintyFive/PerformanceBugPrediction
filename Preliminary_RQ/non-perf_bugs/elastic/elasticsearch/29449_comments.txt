To search the previous page, you can reverse the `sort` order (from `desc` to `asc` for instance) and set `search_after` with the `sort` values of the first document returned in the response. This way you can retrieve the N documents \"before\" any documents in the current response and since the sort is reversed you'll also need to present the documents in reverse order. I am going to close this issue because this is something that you can achieve with `search_after` already.  You've already opened a discussion on the forum so I'll be glad to answer additional questions there.
