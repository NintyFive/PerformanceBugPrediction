This does not seem to be the case for must_not query type.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n1. Create the index\r\n```\r\n{\"properties\": {\"fA\": {\"type\": \"text\"}}}\r\n```\r\n2. Put a document\r\n```\r\n{\"fA\": \"1\"}\r\n```\r\n3. Find a document that must not have field fA (should return nothing):\r\n```\r\n{\"query\": {\r\n  \"bool\": {\r\n    \"must_not\": {\r\n      \"exists\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"fA\",\r\n        \"_name\": \"INSIDE MUST NOT\"\r\n      }\r\n}}}}\r\n```\r\nResult (PASS):\r\n```\r\n{\"hits\": {\"hits\": []}}\r\n```\r\n4. Find a document that must not have field fB (should return the document with INSIDE MUST NOT):\r\n```\r\n{\"query\": {\r\n  \"bool\": {\r\n    \"must_not\": {\r\n      \"exists\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"fB\",\r\n        \"_name\": \"INSIDE MUST NOT\"\r\n      }\r\n}}}}\r\n```\r\nResult (FAIL - **not getting the matched named query**):\r\n```\r\n{\"hits\": {\"hits\": [{\"_source\": {\"fA\": \"1\"}}]}}\r\n```\r\n5. Find a document that must have field fA (should return the document with INSIDE EXISTS):\r\n```\r\n{\"query\": {\r\n  \"bool\": {\r\n    \"must\": {\r\n      \"exists\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"fA\",\r\n        \"_name\": \"INSIDE EXISTS\"\r\n      }\r\n}}}}\r\n```\r\nResult (PASS - **get the matched named query**):\r\n```\r\n{\"hits\": {\"hits\": [{\r\n  \"_source\": {\"fA\": \"1\"},\r\n  \"matched_queries\": [\"INSIDE EXISTS\"]\r\n}]}}\r\n```\r\n6. Find a document that must not have field fB **workaround to get the matched named query** (should return the document with both INSIDE MUST NOT and OUTSIDE MUST NOT):\r\n```\r\n{\"query\": {\r\n  \"bool\": {\r\n    \"must\": {\r\n      \"bool\": {\r\n        \"must_not\": {\r\n          \"exists\": {\r\n            \"field\": \"fB\",\r\n            \"_name\": \"INSIDE MUST NOT\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"_name\": \"OUTSIDE MUST NOT\"\r\n      }\r\n}}}}\r\n```\r\nResult (PARTIALLY PASS - **get the matched named query, but not the INSIDE MUST NOT one?**):\r\n```\r\n{\"hits\": {\"hits\": [{\r\n  \"_source\": {\"fA\": \"1\"},\r\n  \"matched_queries\": [\"OUTSIDE MUST NOT\"]\r\n}]}}\r\n```\r\n7. Find a document that should have field fA but not field fB **with workaround** (should return the document with both named queries):\r\n```\r\n{\"query\": {\r\n  \"bool\": {\r\n    \"should\": [{\r\n      \"exists\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"fA\",\r\n        \"_name\": \"INSIDE EXISTS\"\r\n      }},{\r\n      \"bool\": {\r\n        \"must_not\": {\r\n          \"exists\": {\r\n            \"field\": \"fB\",\r\n            \"_name\": \"INSIDE MUST NOT\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"_name\": \"OUTSIDE MUST NOT\"\r\n      }\r\n}]}}}\r\n```\r\nResult (PARTIALLY PASS - **get both the matched named queries but not the INSIDE MUST NOT one?**):\r\n```\r\n{\"hits\": {\"hits\": [{\r\n  \"_source\": {\"fA\": \"1\"},\r\n  \"matched_queries\": [\"OUTSIDE MUST NOT\", \"INSIDE EXISTS\"]\r\n}]}}\r\n```\r\n8. Find a document that should have field fA but not field fA **with workaround** (should return the document with just INSIDE EXISTS):\r\n```\r\n{\"query\": {\r\n  \"bool\": {\r\n    \"should\": [{\r\n      \"exists\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"fA\",\r\n        \"_name\": \"INSIDE EXISTS\"\r\n      }},{\r\n      \"bool\": {\r\n        \"must_not\": {\r\n          \"exists\": {\r\n            \"field\": \"fA\",\r\n            \"_name\": \"INSIDE MUST NOT\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"_name\": \"OUTSIDE MUST NOT\"\r\n      }\r\n}]}}}\r\n```\r\nResult (FAIL - **Bugged to return INSIDE MUST NOT now?**):\r\n```\r\n{\"hits\": {\"hits\": [{\r\n  \"_source\": {\"fA\": \"1\"},\r\n  \"matched_queries\": [\"INSIDE EXISTS\", \"INSIDE MUST NOT\"]\r\n}]}}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
