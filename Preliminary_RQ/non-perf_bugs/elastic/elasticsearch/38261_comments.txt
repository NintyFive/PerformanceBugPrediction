In general we reserve GitHub for verified bug reports and feature requests and ask that you use the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) for troubleshooting and user questions. I can help you quickly here.\r\n\r\nThis is because you have configured your node to not hold any index data (`node.data` is set to `false`). As such, the write to the `.security-6` index for the new user passwords can not succeed as there are no shard copies available. You either need to add a data node to your cluster so the primary shards can be allocated, or you need to allow your single node to be a data node too.\r\n\r\nIf you have follow-up, please use the forum. \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/460018931","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38261#issuecomment-460018931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38261","id":460018931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDAxODkzMQ==","user":{"login":"chenjienn","id":13412289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyMjg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13412289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjienn","html_url":"https://github.com/chenjienn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjienn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjienn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjienn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjienn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjienn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjienn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjienn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjienn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjienn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-03T03:07:45Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T03:07:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank you for your reply !
