The path should be separated into pieces based on the delimiter.  For each piece in the path if the current level is a Map retrieve the value based on the piece as a key, if the current level is a List retrieve the value based on the piece as an index.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nString path = \"key0.2.key1\";\r\ndef value = getInnerValue(data, path);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis assumes a structure of Map, List, Map and will return the equivalent of data.get('key0').get(2).get('key1');\r\n\r\nThis allows uses to specify a path as part of params and then use this method without having to separate the path themselves.  This is useful in many situations when the context contains _source as there can be many inner fields.","closed_by":{"login":"stu-elastic","id":24232742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjMyNzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24232742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic","html_url":"https://github.com/stu-elastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
