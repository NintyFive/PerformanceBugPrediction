I looked at the previous versions of the project you don't include `<relativePath>` which makes me think your entire hate for Maven could have stemmed from not knowing this feature.\r\n\r\nFrom maven: https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Inheritance\r\n\r\n> \"Notice the relativePath element. It is not required, but may be used as a signifier to Maven to first search the path given for this project's parent, before searching the local and then remote repositories.\"\r\n\r\nThus if you had put the relative path to your parent pom in your submodules maven would not have to go \"download\" the internet.\r\n\r\nI only bring this up because I have people point to your [gradle video](https://youtu.be/6lM8meY9LJ4?t=636) about how the maven reactor won't let them build a part of the project without downloading other modules and thus fundamentally flawed. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh I thought your parent was in a non standard directory. I guess you mean it goes and downloads snapshot pom files. There are ways around that but yes that is the reactor behavior.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
