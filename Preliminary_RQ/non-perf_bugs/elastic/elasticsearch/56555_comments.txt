Asking because the [dense_vector](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/dense-vector.html) datatype is an x-pack feature. In general, question like this are better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
