like to tackle this. However, I have a couple of questions:\n\nI have not understood why a listener is needed. Would it also be ok if we made `BulkProcessor` itself capable of backing off and retrying? I think this could simplify usage.\n\nBtw, I have also two questions about this part of `BulkProcessor#execute()`:\n\n```\n} catch (InterruptedException e) {\n    Thread.interrupted();\n    listener.afterBulk(executionId, bulkRequest, e);\n}\n```\n\nI think instead of `Thread.interrupted()` it should be `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()`. Also does it make sense to notify the listener of interruption (might make sense but the listener needs to be aware of this)?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/157693398","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14620#issuecomment-157693398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14620","id":157693398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzY5MzM5OA==","user":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-18T12:17:24Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T12:17:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just as a quick update.
