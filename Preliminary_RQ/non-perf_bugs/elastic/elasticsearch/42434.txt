Index name completion still works.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nOpen the dev tools and start building a query like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST myIndex/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"term\": {\r\n      \"FIELD\": {\r\n        \"value\": \"VALUE\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlacing the cursor at the beginning of `\"FIELD\" : {` and typing used to present a list of fields that were available in this index. Now there is no autocomplete at all.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
