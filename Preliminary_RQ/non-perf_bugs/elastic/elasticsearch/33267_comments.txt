think this is an interesting idea and I'm thinking through the implications. \r\n\r\nThere's an inherent tension in what we're trying to accomplish. We need to know the field list and associated metadata for fields across potentially thousands of indices. That list is potentially dynamic but static most of the time.\r\n\r\nThe current solution is for kibana to look up and store the field list. Its reset manually by the user when the field list changes. It would be preferable to close the gap between kibana's view of the field list and the field list in elasticsearch. The lifecycle of the kibana index pattern field mapping better matches that of an index template (random thought).\r\n\r\nWould querying field level metadata be scalable?
