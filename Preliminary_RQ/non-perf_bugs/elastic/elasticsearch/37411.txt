introduced deprecation messages when types are used in _bulk APIs.\r\n\r\nThis has caused major throughput drops in our standard nightly benchmarks (that use a [_doc

https://elasticsearch-benchmarks.elastic.co/#tracks/geopoint/nightly/30d:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1754575/51107784-8b6cc380-17f8-11e9-82e2-b833fd7864fd.png)\r\n\r\nOther tracks affected are [http_logs](https://elasticsearch-benchmarks.elastic.co/#tracks/http-logs/nightly/30d), [nyc_taxis](https://elasticsearch-benchmarks.elastic.co/#tracks/nyc-taxis/nightly/30d), [noaa](https://elasticsearch-benchmarks.elastic.co/#tracks/noaa/nightly/30d), [geonames][(https://elasticsearch-benchmarks.elastic.co/#tracks/geonames/nightly/30d) and [nested](https://elasticsearch-benchmarks.elastic.co/#tracks/nested/nightly/30d).\r\n\r\nThe deprecation logger is [suppressing duplicate messages](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/logging/DeprecationLogger.java#L149) hence there is only one entry in the log file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat rally-benchmark_deprecation.log\r\n[2019-01-14T11:05:37,399][WARN ][o.e.d.a.b.BulkRequest    ] [rally-node-0] [types removal] Specifying types in bulk requests is deprecated.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMO a deprecated feature shouldn't cause a performance regression (at least not that magnitude) until it gets removed.","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
