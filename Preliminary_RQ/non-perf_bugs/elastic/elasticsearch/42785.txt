The ids are provided in an array, which is ordered, so the values should be returned as such. What's the benefit in surprising users in a negative way doing something order than what would be expected by default?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3458 was closed years ago abruptly with no explanation, despite it continuing to be requested by many in the years after that. I'd like to open another issue so that it can be actually considered reasonably this time. \r\n\r\nIf you don't want to break the whatever order they're provided in, then an option that can be passed to the query activating this mode would be good.
