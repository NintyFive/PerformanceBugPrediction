From `WindowsPathParser` in the JDK:\n\n``` java\n    // Reserved characters for window path name                                                                                                                                                                                         \n    private static final String reservedChars = \"<>:\\\"|?*\";\n    private static final boolean isInvalidPathChar(char ch) {\n        return ch < '\\u0020' || reservedChars.indexOf(ch) != -1;\n    }\n```\n\nIn master this is fixed by #16442 where we no longer use the index name to derive the folder name but instead use the index UUID (separating name from identity). We can't retroactively forbid `:` in index names because they are okay on non-Windows.\n\nFor now, you can workaround this by changing the `:` to another character, as you already pointed out.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
