We just use the `Version.CURRENT` which is an upper bound. Yet, the other node might be a version less than the currently running and serialisation of the nodes info might break. We should rather use a lower bound here which is the version of the first release with the same major version as `Version.CURRENT` since this is what we officially support. \n\nWe changed the format of the `NodesInfo` serialisation today and BWC tests broken on that. Yet we found a away to work around changing it but in the future we should be able to change transport protocol even if it's `NodesInfo`\n\nNote: this is not a problem until today but in the future this might prevent us from enhancing the protocol here.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
