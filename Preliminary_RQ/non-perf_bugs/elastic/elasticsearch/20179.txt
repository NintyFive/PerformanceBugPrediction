One of those involves invoking a [random syscall](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/2.4/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/bootstrap/Seccomp.java#L278:L280):\n\n```\nlinux_syscall(999)\n```\n\nThere is no guarantee that \"999\" will stay unimplemented in future kernels, or that it won't have a particular meaning just on a specific architecture at any point in time. Moreover, this doesn't play well if there are other supervisors in the environment, which may block dangerous/unknown syscalls. Finally, I don't think it is an expected behavior for a search engine to directly call a random syscall on the basis that it is implemented.\n\nPlease just don't do this, or find some alternative nicer ways of probing, or at least provide some knobs to disable it.\n\n/cc @rmuir who introduced it in 6a8c4a0bb752dfac460d779270bc9045da3fde36\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
