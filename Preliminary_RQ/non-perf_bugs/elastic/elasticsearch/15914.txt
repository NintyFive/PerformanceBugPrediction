I was wondering if there was any ability to blacklist a node while it is recovering. Trying to route GETs, indexing and search to a recovering index can cause the node to fall out of the cluster or can cause the cluster to pause altogether. Is there a way to blacklist a node using the TransportClient that way no traffic is routed to a particular node (or anything similar)?
