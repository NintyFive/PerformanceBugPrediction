We are in the process of moving from a monolithic app based set of applications to a micro-services based architecture. The way that the Java versions tie the client applications to Elasticsearch means that if we want to use Java 8 in one application that talks to Elasticsearch we have to update them all at once which isn't an easy task and goes against the idea of decoupling that micro-services provide us.\n\nWe've looked a little at Jest (https://github.com/searchbox-io/Jest) but it seems to be far behind the curve in terms of the functionality it provides (for example aggregations). We're also nervous about tying ourselves to a 3rd party project that is always going to be behind the curve compared the libraries Elasticsearch maintain.\n\nWe've also started looking at implementing the Elasticsearch Client.java interface to provide a pure HTTP RESTful based solution ourselves but it would be nice to know if this is already being worked on somewhere before we go too far down this path.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/57623409","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743#issuecomment-57623409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743","id":57623409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjIzNDA5","user":{"login":"vvcephei","id":832787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjc4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/832787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei","html_url":"https://github.com/vvcephei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-02T12:39:12Z","updated_at":"2014-10-02T12:39:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey Adrian,\n\nI didn't hear back on the original question, so I have to assume this thing will live on its own.

To clarify, the goal is to get a well designed and supported Java JSON client, not to use HTTP as the transport per se. \n\nTl;dr:\nI doubt there's any way to do the \"right thing\" with native serialization. The right way to go is \"fromXContent\". This is nonzero cost to implement and maintain, but it will save your java users from a lot of grief in the long run. \n\nLong-form thoughts:\nThere may be some benefits to using java serialization with HTTP instead of TCP, but it wouldn't address the main issue I'm confronting.\n\nThe \"FromXContent\" approach is what I had in mind. Native serialization is convenient to use, but it's just too sensitive to differences between the client's and cluster's JVMs. Particularly, I'm thinking of an issue in which the serialization of `Date` changed between java builds (I don't remember which right now; it might have been 1.7.0_25 and _45). This resulted in some very tricky errors for us to debug. It was all the more infuriating in that case because the errors also failed to deserialize, so we couldn't even see what was wrong.\n\nNative serialization may work in most situations, but I don't think there is any way to ensure your clients won't face this kind of issue except to require them to use exactly the same version of java in the client application and the ES cluster. But this is a pretty tall order, since you'll have developer machines, application servers, and elasticsearch hosts, potentially all maintained by different teams; maybe even different companies.\n\nAside: I don't think there's a good reason to change how ES chatters internally because it's easy to guarantee every node in the cluster is using the same JVM version. Internally, efficient and compact serialization should be the priority.\n\nI agree with Shay that we're looking at strictly more code and more maintenance, but the advantage is that you can explicitly control the situations under which a client is or is not api compatible with the server. I personally favor more permissive deserialization, so there wouldn't be a deserialization error unless it's not possible to construct a sane object from the json response, but I can see why you may want to be stricter with version checking. Either way, the typing is just as strong. It's just a question of the semantics as to whether certain fields are permitted to be absent on response objects.\n\nI have already started implementing the \"fromXContent\" method for some parts of the API. I'm structuring it right now as a standalone library, but I'm happy to put it right inside the response objects instead and send a PR. This would make the implementation a little easier because there are a few cases where I need access to protected members to perform the deserialization, so I've had to play distasteful games with the packages.\n\nI should mention that I've been preoccupied with my main project at work for the last couple of months, so the implementation situation is not much changed from my last exchange with Adrian.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/71335853","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743#issuecomment-71335853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743","id":71335853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMzM1ODUz","user":{"login":"jtjeferreira","id":943051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzA1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/943051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtjeferreira","html_url":"https://github.com/jtjeferreira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtjeferreira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtjeferreira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtjeferreira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtjeferreira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtjeferreira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtjeferreira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtjeferreira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtjeferreira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtjeferreira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-24T20:29:58Z","updated_at":"2015-01-24T20:29:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hi @vvcephei \n\nyou have any progress on your work?

I can see arguments on both sides of this, so I'd like to see what you think before I start sending PRs.\n\nThanks, everyone,\n-John\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/155920340","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743#issuecomment-155920340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743","id":155920340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTkyMDM0MA==","user":{"login":"matt-blanchette","id":4365537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjU1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4365537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette","html_url":"https://github.com/matt-blanchette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-11T21:49:15Z","updated_at":"2015-11-11T21:49:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1 for same Client API but with HTTP transport\nThe Amazon ElasticSearch Service currently only supports HTTP\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/186326370","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743#issuecomment-186326370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743","id":186326370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjMyNjM3MA==","user":{"login":"davsclaus","id":477100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzEwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/477100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davsclaus","html_url":"https://github.com/davsclaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davsclaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davsclaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davsclaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davsclaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davsclaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davsclaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davsclaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davsclaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davsclaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-19T17:46:45Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T17:46:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/186951460","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743#issuecomment-186951460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743","id":186951460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Njk1MTQ2MA==","user":{"login":"vvcephei","id":832787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjc4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/832787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei","html_url":"https://github.com/vvcephei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-22T00:30:54Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T00:30:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @matt-blanchette and @davsclaus,\n\nIt's good to hear I'm not the only one who thinks this should happen.

The first version of the java client will be quite low level, with a very simple `performRequest` method that allows to send http requests to the cluster doing round-robin against multiple nodes and handling fail-over.
