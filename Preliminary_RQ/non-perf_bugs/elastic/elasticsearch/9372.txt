The `IndexMetadata.Custom` interface has a `merge` method that allows to merging two custom index metadatas. This is used, for instance, when applying index templates at index creation, since the create index request and index templates can both contain custom metadata which need to be merged to obtain the metadata for the new index.\n\nWe also support cluster level custom metadata to the cluster state (`ClusterState.Custom`), but no merging is supported there. This would be useful for instance on the tribe node, where we merge the cluster states from the different tribes to create a single cluster state view on top of them. \n\nWe should introduce a `merge` function on the `ClusterState.Custom.Factory` that will determine if/how the custom metadata should be merged on tribe.\n\nFor extensibility sake, we should consider adding this `merge` function on any `Custom` construct that we have (we also have `MetaData.Custom`)\n","closed_by":{"login":"areek","id":753679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/753679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek","html_url":"https://github.com/areek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
