It is https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/cde126dbff1e443bdaa13b5d1b541dfb037db028/modules/ingest-common/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/ingest/common/DateIndexNameProcessor.java#L93\r\n\r\nThis is perplexing, because when I wrote \"However, while making this change I found that changing the default for date processing in ingest also affects index naming with the date index name processor\" in #37935 I must have observed a place where the date index name processor was being affected by the changes to `org.elasticsearch.ingest.common.DateFormat` in #37407.  So I suspect that the date index name processor is currently in an inconsistent state where one aspect of it uses the Joda BWC layer or Java time formatting and another aspect of it still uses Joda time directly.\r\n\r\nSo I think to adhere to the principle that 6.7 will output deprecation warnings for uses of Joda time formats that won't work in 7.0 `org.elasticsearch.ingest.common.DateIndexNameProcessor` needs changing for 6.7 and then again in 7.0 to only use Java timestamp formats.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/459302993","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38067#issuecomment-459302993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38067","id":459302993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTMwMjk5Mw==","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-31T10:58:14Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T10:58:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'll take it and work on that one today","performed_via_github_app":null}]
