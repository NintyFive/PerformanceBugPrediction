Scripts can be used across different indexes with different mappings, so if one mapping is float and one mapping is int there is no way to tell at compile-time which mapping to apply without tying a script to an index.  This cannot be done because our customers expect to be able to use the same script across multiple indexes.  This is unlikely to change in the near future if at all.  Even if we did infer from the mappings, this still would not work because it would require us to infer the RHS from the LHS.
