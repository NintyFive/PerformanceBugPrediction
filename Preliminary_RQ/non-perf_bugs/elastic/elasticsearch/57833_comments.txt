If this happens to every request, as you're seeing, it's a strong indication that the cluster is heavily overloaded. Is there other load (other indices, other processes sending documents, other queries, etc.) present on this cluster, or did this issue occur immediately after setting up a new cluster?\r\n\r\nIf there's other load, it's highly likely that the cluster is simply overloaded and either needs the load reduced, or more resources added.\r\n\r\nIf this occurred with a new cluster, there might be a bug to investigate here.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/641679704","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57833#issuecomment-641679704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57833","id":641679704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTY3OTcwNA==","user":{"login":"jaydlowrider","id":1182594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODI1OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1182594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydlowrider","html_url":"https://github.com/jaydlowrider","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydlowrider/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydlowrider/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydlowrider/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydlowrider/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydlowrider/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydlowrider/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydlowrider/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydlowrider/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaydlowrider/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T02:20:52Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T02:20:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello @gwbrown\r\n\r\nThanks for your response..\r\n\r\nI thought it was beats that caused this, but it seems that its an ongoing problem similar to what you mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe cluster is heavily used, there is very high write, and query, we have 1TB ingest for of 1 index, specifically and we have ILM setup as for hot-warm rolling 3 days on Hot and 25 days to warm.\r\n\r\n>present on this cluster, or did this issue occur immediately after setting up a new cluster?\r\n\r\nThis happens over time, it looked like between 1-2 weeks.
