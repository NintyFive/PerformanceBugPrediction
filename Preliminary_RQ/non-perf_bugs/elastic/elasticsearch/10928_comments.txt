Application developers should\n\n# consult the guide at http://elasticsearch.org/guide.\n\n#\n\n# The installation procedure is covered at\n\n# <\n\nhttp://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html\n\n> .\n> #\n> \n> # Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings,\n> \n> # so you can try it out without bothering with configuration.\n> \n> #\n> \n> # Most of the time, these defaults are just fine for running a production\n> \n> # cluster. If you're fine-tuning your cluster, or wondering about the\n> \n> # effect of certain configuration option, please _do ask_ on the\n> \n> # mailing list or IRC channel [http://elasticsearch.org/community].\n\n# Any element in the configuration can be replaced with environment\n\nvariables\n\n# by placing them in ${...} notation. For example:\n\n#\n#node.rack: ${RACK_ENV_VAR}\n\n# For information on supported formats and syntax for the config file, see\n\n# <\n\nhttp://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html\n\n\n################################### Cluster\n###################################\n\n# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running\n\n# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique\n\nnames.\n#\n#cluster.name: elasticsearch\n\n#################################### Node\n#####################################\n\n# Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so you're relieved\n\n# from configuring them manually. You can tie this node to a specific name:\n\n#\n#node.name: \"Franz Kafka\"\n\n# Every node can be configured to allow or deny being eligible as the\n\nmaster,\n\n# and to allow or deny to store the data.\n\n#\n\n# Allow this node to be eligible as a master node (enabled by default):\n\n#\n#node.master: true\n#\n\n# Allow this node to store data (enabled by default):\n\n#\n#node.data: true\n\n# You can exploit these settings to design advanced cluster topologies.\n\n#\n\n# 1. You want this node to never become a master node, only to hold data.\n\n# This will be the \"workhorse\" of your cluster.\n\n#\n#node.master: false\n#node.data: true\n#\n\n# 2. You want this node to only serve as a master: to not store any data and\n\n# to have free resources. This will be the \"coordinator\" of your cluster.\n\n#\n#node.master: true\n#node.data: false\n#\n\n# 3. You want this node to be neither master nor data node, but\n\n# to act as a \"search load balancer\" (fetching data from nodes,\n\n# aggregating results, etc.)\n\n#\n#node.master: false\n#node.data: false\n\n# Use the Cluster Health API [http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health], the\n\n# Node Info API [http://localhost:9200/_nodes] or GUI tools\n\n# such as http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/marvel/,\n\n# http://github.com/karmi/elasticsearch-paramedic,\n\n# http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/bigdesk and\n\n# http://mobz.github.com/elasticsearch-head to inspect the cluster state.\n\n# A node can have generic attributes associated with it, which can later be\n\nused\n\n# for customized shard allocation filtering, or allocation awareness. An\n\nattribute\n\n# is a simple key value pair, similar to node.key: value, here is an\n\nexample:\n#\n#node.rack: rack314\n\n# By default, multiple nodes are allowed to start from the same\n\ninstallation location\n\n# to disable it, set the following:\n\n#node.max_local_storage_nodes: 1\n\n#################################### Index\n####################################\n\n# You can set a number of options (such as shard/replica options, mapping\n\n# or analyzer definitions, translog settings, ...) for indices globally,\n\n# in this file.\n\n#\n\n# Note, that it makes more sense to configure index settings specifically\n\nfor\n\n# a certain index, either when creating it or by using the index templates\n\nAPI.\n#\n\n# See <\n\nhttp://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html>\nand\n\n# <\n\nhttp://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html\n\n> # for more information.\n\n# Set the number of shards (splits) of an index (5 by default):\n\n#\n#index.number_of_shards: 5\n\n# Set the number of replicas (additional copies) of an index (1 by default):\n\n#\n#index.number_of_replicas: 1\n\n# Note, that for development on a local machine, with small indices, it\n\nusually\n\n# makes sense to \"disable\" the distributed features:\n\n#\n#index.number_of_shards: 1\n#index.number_of_replicas: 0\n\n# These settings directly affect the performance of index and search\n\noperations\n\n# in your cluster. Assuming you have enough machines to hold shards and\n\n# replicas, the rule of thumb is:\n\n#\n\n# 1. Having more _shards_ enhances the _indexing_ performance and allows to\n\n# _distribute_ a big index across machines.\n\n# 2. Having more _replicas_ enhances the _search_ performance and improves\n\nthe\n\n# cluster _availability_.\n\n#\n\n# The \"number_of_shards\" is a one-time setting for an index.\n\n#\n\n# The \"number_of_replicas\" can be increased or decreased anytime,\n\n# by using the Index Update Settings API.\n\n#\n\n# Elasticsearch takes care about load balancing, relocating, gathering the\n\n# results from nodes, etc. Experiment with different settings to fine-tune\n\n# your setup.\n\n# Use the Index Status API (http://localhost:9200/A/_status) to inspect\n\n# the index status.\n\n#################################### Paths\n####################################\n\n# Path to directory containing configuration (this file and logging.yml):\n\n#\n#path.conf: /path/to/conf\n\n# Path to directory where to store index data allocated for this node.\n\n#\n#path.data: /path/to/data\n#\n\n# Can optionally include more than one location, causing data to be striped\n\nacross\n\n# the locations (a la RAID 0) on a file level, favouring locations with\n\nmost free\n\n# space on creation.

(the range means that if the port is busy, it will\n\nautomatically\n\n# try the next port).\n\n# Set the bind address specifically (IPv4 or IPv6):\n\n#\n#network.bind_host: localhost\n\n# Set the address other nodes will use to communicate with this node. If not\n\n# set, it is automatically derived. It must point to an actual IP address.\n\n#\n#network.publish_host: 192.168.0.1\n\n# Set both 'bind_host' and 'publish_host':\n\n#\n#network.host: 192.168.0.1\n\n# Set a custom port for the node to node communication (9300 by default):\n\n#\n#transport.tcp.port: 9300\n\n# Enable compression for all communication between nodes (disabled by\n\ndefault):\n#\n#transport.tcp.compress: true\n\n# Set a custom port to listen for HTTP traffic:\n\n#\nhttp.port: 9201\n\n# Set a custom allowed content length:\n\n#\n#http.max_content_length: 100mb\n\n# Disable HTTP completely:\n\n#\n#http.enabled: false\n\n################################### Gateway\n###################################\n\n# The gateway allows for persisting the cluster state between full cluster\n\n# restarts. Every change to the state (such as adding an index) will be\n\nstored\n\n# in the gateway, and when the cluster starts up for the first time,\n\n# it will read its state from the gateway.\n\n# There are several types of gateway implementations. For more information,\n\nsee\n\n# <\n\nhttp://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-gateway.html\n\n> .\n\n# The default gateway type is the \"local\" gateway (recommended):\n\n#\n#gateway.type: local\n\n# Settings below control how and when to start the initial recovery process\n\non\n\n# a full cluster restart (to reuse as much local data as possible when\n\nusing shared\n\n# gateway).\n\n# Allow recovery process after N nodes in a cluster are up:\n\n#\n#gateway.recover_after_nodes: 1\n\n# Set the timeout to initiate the recovery process, once the N nodes\n\n# from previous setting are up (accepts time value):\n\n#\n#gateway.recover_after_time: 5m\n\n# Set how many nodes are expected in this cluster. Once these N nodes\n\n# are up (and recover_after_nodes is met), begin recovery process\n\nimmediately\n\n# (without waiting for recover_after_time to expire):\n\n#\n#gateway.expected_nodes: 2\n\n############################# Recovery Throttling\n#############################\n\n# These settings allow to control the process of shards allocation between\n\n# nodes during initial recovery, replica allocation, rebalancing,\n\n# or when adding and removing nodes.\n\n# Set the number of concurrent recoveries happening on a node:\n\n#\n\n# 1. During the initial recovery\n\n#\n#cluster.routing.allocation.node_initial_primaries_recoveries: 4\n#\n\n# 2. During adding/removing nodes, rebalancing, etc\n\n#\n#cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries: 2\n\n# Set to throttle throughput when recovering (eg. 100mb, by default 20mb):\n\n#\n#indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec: 20mb\n\n# Set to limit the number of open concurrent streams when\n\n# recovering a shard from a peer:\n\n#\n#indices.recovery.concurrent_streams: 5\n\n################################## Discovery\n##################################\n\n# Discovery infrastructure ensures nodes can be found within a cluster\n\n# and master node is elected. Multicast discovery is the default.\n\n# Set to ensure a node sees N other master eligible nodes to be considered\n\n# operational within the cluster. This should be set to a quorum/majority\n\nof\n\n# the master-eligible nodes in the cluster.\n\n#\n#discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 1\n\n# Set the time to wait for ping responses from other nodes when discovering.\n\n# Set this option to a higher value on a slow or congested network\n\n# to minimize discovery failures:\n\n#\n#discovery.zen.ping.timeout: 3s\n\n# For more information, see\n\n# <\n\nhttp://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery-zen.html\n\n\n# Unicast discovery allows to explicitly control which nodes will be used\n\n# to discover the cluster. It can be used when multicast is not present,\n\n# or to restrict the cluster communication-wise.\n\n#\n\n# 1. Disable multicast discovery (enabled by default):\n\n#\n#discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: true\n\n#\n\n# 2.
