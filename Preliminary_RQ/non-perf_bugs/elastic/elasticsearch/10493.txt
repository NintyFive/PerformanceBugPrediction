Following the process outlined at:\nhttp://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/_rolling_restarts.html, we set `cluster.routing.allocation.enable` to `none` before restarting each node; in the past (<1.4) this has worked a charm, and the shards from the restarted node have remained unassigned until re-enabled. However, at 1.5 this setting is seemingly ignored, and the shards are instantly re-assigned to the remaining nodes in the cluster.\n\nThe result is that restarting each node is taking ~30-60 minutes rather than the ~5 it used to take, because we now have to rebalance everything after all the shards are re-assigned, mostly on the wrong nodes.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
