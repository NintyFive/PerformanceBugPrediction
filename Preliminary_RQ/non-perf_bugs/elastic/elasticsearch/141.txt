Basically, the idea is to expose elasticsearch REST interface over memcached protocol. In general, the key part of the protocol is the REST uri used. For `set` command, the body is the REST body (http body). For `get` commands, the return payload is the body. `set` translates to `POST`, `get` translates to `GET`, and `delete` translates to `DELETE`. Note, this are the only commands implemented (and `quit`).\n\nNote, memcached imposes restrictions compared to the REST protocol. `set` can not return a body for the response, and `get` can't accept body for the request (note, the uri can have query parameters).\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
