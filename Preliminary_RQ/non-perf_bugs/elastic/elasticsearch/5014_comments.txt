The terms filter can accept multiple term values but it can only search in a single field. If it encounters multiple fields, it's using all term values to search the last field. In other words your query is equivalent to \n\n```\n{\n    \"filter\": {\n        \"terms\": {\n            \"model\": [3, 157]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPerhaps, we should change our parser to throw an exception in this case.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
