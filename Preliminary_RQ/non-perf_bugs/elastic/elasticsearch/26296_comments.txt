For some APIs the results are the same but I agree that we could have more examples of answers in the docs. Are you willing to contribute ? You could start with the example you linked and add an example replies for the `match` and `multi_match` query ?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/328753257","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26296#issuecomment-328753257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26296","id":328753257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODc1MzI1Nw==","user":{"login":"aclowkey","id":2061017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjEwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2061017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclowkey","html_url":"https://github.com/aclowkey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclowkey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclowkey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclowkey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclowkey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclowkey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclowkey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclowkey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclowkey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclowkey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-12T06:36:55Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T06:36:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think it's a great idea.
