However, also like #53308, not sure if this should be recommended since it gathers much more information than you desire. \r\n\r\nYou can also deduce the index count from `level=shards`.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nGET _nodes/stats?level=indices&filter_path=nodes.*.indices.indices\r\nGET _nodes/stats?level=shards&filter_path=nodes.*.indices.shards\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will still take the todo to examine how expensive these level parameters are to call from monitoring (by default every 10s). However, I think this also warrants a further discussion about APIs that better match what you are looking for and/or dedicated monitoring APIs. I will start another conversation thread on that subject.
