So long as there is reliable and ample network connection between 2 sites, why not?   If Elasticsearch had insight into the reliability of it's relationship to other nodes in the cluster, this could serve as a vital cluster health metrics.\n\nTo know that, it would be great if each ES node could track shard transfer rate, ping time, packet loss, relative uptime, etc, metrics against any/all other known nodes.   Also tracking  minimum_masters stable time from each node's perspective would be useful too.\n\nThe results of the metrics could be used in diagnosing or indicating stability problems due to network issues.   The availability metrics would be skewed by node restarts, etc, but it would still be highly useful.  The transfer rate data would always be consistent.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
