Imagine the following steps:\n1. We have a one node in the cluster, `A`\n2. `A` creates an index called `idx` with UUID `xyz`.\n3. The data directory for node `A` is copied to some external location.\n4. `idx` is deleted from the cluster.\n5. Start up a new node `B` in the cluster\n6. After `B` has started up, copy the data directory previous put in an external location to the data directory for `B`\n7. Start a new node `C`, just in order to trigger a cluster state update.\n\nAt this point, the previously deleted `idx` with UUID `xyz` is imported into the index as a dangling index, even though a tombstone exists for it in the cluster state.  This leads to a very confusing situation where the index exists in the cluster state and at the same time, there is a tombstone for it.  Also, when the node restarts, it will check the tombstones, see the index is deleted, so delete it - that means the index re-appeared in the cluster state for some time but will be deleted again upon node restart.\n\nAlso, note that this problem does not occur if the data directory is copied before `B` is started, because in that case on node startup, the tombstones are checked so the index is not permitted to be imported as dangling.\n","closed_by":{"login":"abeyad","id":1631297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzEyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1631297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad","html_url":"https://github.com/abeyad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
