That issue is now closed however so opening this again as a separate ticket so it won't be buried in the field name/path resolution refactor.\n\nConsider the following mapping:\n\n``` json\nDELETE index123\nPUT index123\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"people\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"o.x.y\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"analyzer\": \"standard\"\n        },\n        \"o.x.z\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"boost\": 2\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPOST index123/people\n{\n  \"o\" : {\n    \"x\" : {\n      \"y\" : \"this is analyzed\",\n      \"z\" : \"2015-05-25T22:13:04+02:00\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen we do a `GET index123/_mapping` we get the following mapping for people:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"people\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"o\": {\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"x\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"y\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\"\n              },\n              \"z\": {\n                \"type\": \"date\",\n                \"format\": \"dateOptionalTime\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"o.x.y\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"analyzer\": \"standard\"\n      },\n      \"o.x.z\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"boost\": 2\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe string mapping for `o.x.z` is ignored and it becomes a `date`. \n\nInterestingly if we had mapped it as an `integer` e.g\n\n``` json\n\"o.x.z\": {\n    \"type\": \"integer\",\n    \"ignore_malformed\": false\n}\n```\n\nand indexed the following document\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"o\" : {\n    \"x\" : {\n      \"y\" : \"this is analyzed\",\n      \"z\" : \"asdasda\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwe DO get a `NumberFormatException[For input string: \\\"asdasda\\\"]`. Something is out of sync here. \n\nRegardless of the field name/path resolution fixes it would be very handy if we'd get a mapping exception whenever we try to map a field with dots in it to prevent ambiguous mappings. \n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
