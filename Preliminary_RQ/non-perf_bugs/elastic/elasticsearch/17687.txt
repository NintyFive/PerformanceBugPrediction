I wouldn't want to make it too fancy, but it might be nice to say something along the lines of \"see _forcemerge\".\n\nWhat do you think @clintongormley?\n","closed_by":{"login":"pickypg","id":1501235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1501235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg","html_url":"https://github.com/pickypg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
