Actually deflate vs lz4 matters very little: we've had experimental deflate in lucene since... 4.1 i think? But it would not actually compress any better in most cases than lz4, even though it was set to level 9!\n\nCurrently we use a hack, a huge block size (60KB vs 16KB) to allow this algorithm to compress better within the confines of the current format.\n\nBut what is really needed for it to kick ass is to have shared dictionary support. Its just nontrivial to have both shared dictionary support _and_ bulk merging without recompression _and_ low memory overhead _and_ good performance and all this shit that people want.\n\nAlso the java apis around deflate dictionaries are weak: you don't have access to the current compression dictionary like the trick used for http://zlib.net/pigz/ or any of that: so I wouldnt be surprised if the algorithm was changed to something else in the future.\n\nAnyway full details are already in the lucene file formats docs (http://lucene.apache.org/core/5_3_0/core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/lucene50/Lucene50StoredFieldsFormat.html)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/139945804","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13541#issuecomment-139945804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13541","id":139945804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTk0NTgwNA==","user":{"login":"markwalkom","id":3184718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODQ3MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3184718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom","html_url":"https://github.com/markwalkom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-14T02:41:48Z","updated_at":"2015-09-14T02:42:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Do the same comments above (roughly) apply for LZ4?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/141658976","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13541#issuecomment-141658976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13541","id":141658976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTY1ODk3Ng==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-19T12:05:35Z","updated_at":"2015-09-19T12:05:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed by #13549\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
