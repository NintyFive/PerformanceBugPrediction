In the case that \r\n\r\n1. Many `oidc` realms are configured\r\n1. the oidc realm that the user aims to use is not the one with the lower order value\r\n1. authorization code grant flow is used\r\n\r\nElasticsearch will send out requests to the Token Endpoints of all the OPs that are configured in the realms with lower order. This has the following disadvantages: \r\n\r\n- An extra network round-trip for each defined oidc realm with lower order. \r\n- Authorization Code leakage as all other OPs get to see an authorization code that is meant for the OP the user wanted to use in this case. There are other mitigating factors in this case: \r\n  - Authorization codes are supposed to be short lived and one use only.\r\n  - OPs should require client authentication for access to the TokenEndpoint. \r\n  - OPs should validate that the code submitted in Token Request, was issued the the\r\n    client that is currently authenticated. \r\n\r\nWe could accept an optional parameter in the  `_security/oidc/authenticate` API to indicate the realm name that should be used to validate this request.
