But do you think it makes sense to contact the Mockito maintainers and try to submit a PR to make Mockito itlself aware of Java's security manager so we don't have to maintain securemock (I know that this is a lot of work too but might be worth it for easier upgrades)?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/384132464","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29934#issuecomment-384132464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29934","id":384132464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDEzMjQ2NA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-04T07:38:34Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T01:31:26Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"*Original comment by @rjernst:*\n\n>  do you think it makes sense to contact the Mockito maintainers and try to submit a PR to make Mockito itlself aware of Java's security manager\r\n\r\nYes, that would be great. But note that the only likely way for this to work is for them to have tests using a security manager.
