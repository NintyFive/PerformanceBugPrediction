The feature request, therefore, asks to allow another option that the deletion should happen `x` number of days/hours after the `creation date` of the original index, regardless of the fact that it is rolled over or not.\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\nI want to keep my indices not to grow over 30gb in size, but I want to make sure that I don't keep more than one month's data.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JohannesMahne","id":4738843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mzg4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4738843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesMahne","html_url":"https://github.com/JohannesMahne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesMahne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesMahne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesMahne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesMahne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesMahne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesMahne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesMahne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesMahne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohannesMahne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
