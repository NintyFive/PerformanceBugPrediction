The current situation is this:\r\n\r\n- The initial processing between receiving the user request and fieldCaps call is performed on the `transport_worker` thread.\r\n- After the information about mappings is received, we process these mappings on the `management` thread. This is where mapping merging and plan analysis occurs and the search request is formulated\r\n- The search request is sent to the elasticsearch, and when the response is received, we analyze and reformat the response and return it to the user on the `search` thread.\r\n\r\nI think that reusing transport thread for the initial processing is justifiable since we don't do any heavy lifting there, but I am not sure about the second and the thirds steps.  \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
