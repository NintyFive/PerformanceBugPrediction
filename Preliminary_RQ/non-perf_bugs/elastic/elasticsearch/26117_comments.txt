For me it'd be useful to have something that implements the `Client` interface for testing and migrating but I understand the logic of wanting the break with the interface. I believe we haven't implemented that shim layer to the `Client` interface because of the time it'd take, because it'd be incomplete as the high level client doesn't have all of the `Client` features, and we believe that it is *probably* a good idea to migrate away from `Client` anyway.\r\n\r\nAnecdotally, as much as I'm comfortable with the `Client` interface because I'm familiar with it, I'm a long way away from loving it. It feels very large and ceremonial to me.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/321251754","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26117#issuecomment-321251754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26117","id":321251754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTI1MTc1NA==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-09T13:15:46Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T13:15:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks @nik9000 for the concise yet complete explanation. Have a look at #9201 to see some more opinions and reasons behind the decisions we made. We decided not to implement the `Client` interface for the reasons stated above, but to help users migrate from the transport client we have kept the same request and response objects. Have a look at the [migration guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/master/java-rest-high-level-migration.html) to know more.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
