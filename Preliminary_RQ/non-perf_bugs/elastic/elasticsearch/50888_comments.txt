Over time, we are aiming to move even more the logic that is currently in shell scripts into cross-platform Java code (see also the `jvm.options` parser).\r\n\r\nThe Java version checker hardly contributes to the build time. As for the lines of code, it already a small number of lines of code, and having to rewrite that logic in shell and batch would negate some of the savings anyway.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback, but we are going to leave this as-is.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/573487006","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50888#issuecomment-573487006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50888","id":573487006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzQ4NzAwNg==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-13T02:18:27Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T02:18:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra (:Core/Infra/Build)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
