Count queries were being cached wrongly for this type of query (actually, the only type of query since mlt is a different beast).\n\n  Note, mlt relies on document frequencies, and they are (as the case in the terms API) not exact until deletes are expunged (documents in Lucene are not deleted, just marked as deleted until they are merged out).\n\nFor cases like mlt, this should be good enough (the query will _not_ return a document that does not exists).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/176139","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/97#issuecomment-176139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/97","id":176139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjEzOQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-04-02T16:13:40Z","updated_at":"2010-04-02T16:13:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed++\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
