The problem here seems to be that we are running into the timeout that the retrying stream is supposed to handle when opening the stream already. The retrying stream only handles the timeout during reads properly though, leading to this failure. I'll open a fix PR shortly (next week or maybe tomorrow).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
