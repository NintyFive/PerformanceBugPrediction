From my point of view, these two headers don't apply in this context.\n\nIn fact, I think that there is a difference between an empty json content for the response and no content in the response. ElasticSearch only implements the first approach and this issue is about the second one.\n\nHoping I'm clear in my explanations.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/33467439","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4919#issuecomment-33467439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4919","id":33467439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDY3NDM5","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-28T10:40:48Z","updated_at":"2014-01-28T10:40:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"another option is `new StringRestResponse(NOT_FOUND)` (for example), shorter.

In addition adding this test would prevent from null pointer exceptions when the contentType property is null. My 2 cents ;-)\n\nOtherwise to take a sample of what is done within the Restlet framework for the delete HTTP method, these headers (content-type and content-length) are only added to the response if we specify a representation / entity.\n\nHope it helps.\nThierry\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68069623","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4919#issuecomment-68069623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4919","id":68069623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDY5NjIz","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-24T18:58:53Z","updated_at":"2014-12-24T18:58:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @templth \n\nGiven that there has been no movement on this issue in almost a year, I think it is unlikely we will ever get around to supporting it.
