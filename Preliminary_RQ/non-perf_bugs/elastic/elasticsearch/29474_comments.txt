You can use a custom `order` for the `terms` aggregation:\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation-order\r\n.. and returns the last N values based on the metric that you want (`max`, `min`, ...).\r\nI chatted with @timroes which said that the top_hit visualization (or the terms visualization) in Kibana could be enhanced to allows a concatenated view of the buckets so I am going to close this issue and you can probably ask him to reopen your issue in Kibana repo ;).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
