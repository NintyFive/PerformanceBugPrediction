This kind of questions / problems should first be posted in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) before opening an issue in github. If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified \r\nbug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/)\r\nthat should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I \r\nhope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\n> I met a error for a long time, it occurs at 23:10 every day , I am very puzzled.\r\n\r\nThis looks like an automatic process doing something with ES and/or data directories.\r\n\r\n> ES version: 5.5.3\r\n\r\nThis is an old version. I highly recommend upgrading to latest 6.8 version or later.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
