Do you know if there is any further documentation on this logic? I had a cluster go down because my coordinator nodes ran out of heap space and I suspect an excessively high number of messages in the work queue may have been to blame (data in prometheus shows that there were, at one point, over 3,000 messages in the queue even though the \"limit\" was still set to 200).\r\n\r\nThanks for any help you can provide! I will also post this question to the forums.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/382857492","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15101#issuecomment-382857492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15101","id":382857492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Mjg1NzQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-19T19:42:50Z","updated_at":"2018-04-19T19:42:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@eherot np.

Could there be cases where a slow replica can bump up memory pressure on primary if primary continues to take in requests while still holding onto unprocessed replication requests.
