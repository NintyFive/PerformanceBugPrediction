In `DiscoveryService.doStart()` the `Discovery` is started but the lifecycle for `DiscoveryService` is started only after that. This is why when the first cluster state reaches `DiscoveryService.publish` the lifecycle might or might not have started.\n\nI am not yet sure what the implications are. However, when I add an artificial delay in `DiscoveryService.doStart()` like this:\n\n```\n@Override\n    protected void doStart() throws ElasticsearchException {\n        initialStateListener = new InitialStateListener();\n        discovery.addListener(initialStateListener);\n        discovery.start();\n        logger.info(discovery.nodeDescription());\n        try {\n            //NOCOMMIT\n            sleep(1000);\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThe `NoMasterNodeTests` fail occasionally. It seems like sometimes the cluster is not blocked properly for writes. In addition, this makes all test in pr #9952 fail as described [here](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/9952#issuecomment-77535805).\nI think this needs to be investigated.\n","closed_by":{"login":"brwe","id":4320215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjAyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4320215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe","html_url":"https://github.com/brwe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
