In particular, in [scripted similarity](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-similarity.html#scripted_similarity) you have access to  `term.docFreq` - a number of matching documents for this term.  You can use this value and other values to come up with your own score calculations.\r\n\r\n> is ability to stop boosting after X products of _that_ brand being boosted. ....P.S. Does function_score is executed on every document that matches query (filter query in my case) or just a paginated subset returned by a query?\r\n\r\nThe same score calculation is done for every matched document. But you can use [rescore](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-rescore.html) for your top documents.  \r\n\r\nI am closing this issue, as what the issue is requesting `Feature Request: Adjust score based on number of matching documents` can already be done through a custom similarity. If you have a specific feature request for rescoring, please submit a separate issue.  \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
