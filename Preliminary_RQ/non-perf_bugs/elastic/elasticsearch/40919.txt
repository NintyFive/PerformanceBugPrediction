The symptom that gives this away is a total lack of monitoring data from Elasticsearch, but more directly you should find these messages in your `DEBUG`-level logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-04-05T20:34:52,500][DEBUG][o.e.x.m.MonitoringService] [node-1] monitoring execution is skipped until previous execution terminated\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the same way, it will also never respond to `POST /_xpack/monitoring/_bulk` requests (any monitoring data from Kibana, Logstash, Beats, or APM Server), which causes their transport tasks to remain open (although the rest of the memory _is_ freed). The symptom that gives this away is that the tasks remain even though no monitoring threads are actually running:\r\n\r\n```http\r\nGET /_cat/tasks?v\r\naction                              task_id                        parent_task_id                 type      start_time    timestamp running_time ip        node\r\ncluster:admin/xpack/monitoring/bulk dh19vrTDTbWU9unnZD6dDA:2922459 -                              transport 1554508069093 23:47:49  47.7m        127.0.0.1 node-1\r\ncluster:admin/xpack/monitoring/bulk dh19vrTDTbWU9unnZD6dDA:2922483 -                              transport 1554508070097 23:47:50  47.7m        127.0.0.1 node-1\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"pickypg","id":1501235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1501235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg","html_url":"https://github.com/pickypg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
