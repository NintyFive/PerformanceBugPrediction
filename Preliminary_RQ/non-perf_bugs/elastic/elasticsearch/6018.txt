I'm using a fast SSD.\n\nWith no throttling (index.store.throttle.type=none), the merge takes\n20.8 seconds.\n\nWith the default 50 MB/sec merge throttling, it takes 72.1 sec, which\nfar too long (611 MB / 50 = 12.2 sec).  The rate limiter enforces the\ninstantaneous rate, so at worse the merge time should have been 20.8 +\n12.2 = 33 sec but likely much less than that because merging takes\nCPU time.\n\nSo I dug in and discovered one problem, I think caused by the\nsuper.flush and then delegate.flush in BufferedChecksumIndexOutput,\nwhere the RateLimiter is always alternately called first on 8192 bytes\nthen on 0 bytes.  If I fix RateLimiter to just ignore those 0 bytes,\nthe merge time with 50 MB/sec throttle drops to 49.9 sec: better, but\nstill too long.  (I think once we cutover to Lucene's checksums this 0\nbyte issue will be fixed?)\n\nSystem.nanoTime is actually quite costly, so I suspect the overhead of\njust checking whether to pause, and of calling Thread.sleep, is way\ntoo much when the pause time is small.  So I change SimpleRateLimiter to\njust accumulate the incoming bytes and then once it crosses 1 msec\nworth at the specified rate, invoke the pause logic.\n\nThis really improved it: now the merge takes 25.7 sec at 50 MB/sec\nthrottle, and 64.9 sec at 10 MB/sec throttle.  These times seem correct.\n\nI'll also open a Lucene issue to fix this, and make an XRateLimiter\nfor ES in the meantime.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
