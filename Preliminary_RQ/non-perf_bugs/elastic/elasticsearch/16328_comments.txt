There are some [notoriously tricky](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#_boolean_operators) issues surrounding the precedence rules (cf. [LUCENE-1823](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1823) and [`BooleanQuerySyntax`](https://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BooleanQuerySyntax) for historical background) and so if there's any possible confusion for precedence, you should just use [grouping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#_grouping) so as to remove all such confusion.\n\nFor future reference, questions like this are best asked on the [Elastic Discourse forums](https://discuss.elastic.co) whereas bug reports and feature requests are best reported here. If you do have a followup question, please open a discussion there and the community will be very happy to engage with you. :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
