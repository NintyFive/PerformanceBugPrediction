On startup we check to see whether an index exists. If it doesn't, we try to create it. The code we use for this is:\n\n```\nif(!client.admin().cluster().state(clusterStateRequest()).actionGet().getState().metaData().getIndices().containsKey(\"valuations\")) {\n    client.admin().indices().create(request).actionGet();\n}\n```\n\nThis used to work fine in 0.11.0. However, in 0.12.1 we find the getIndices() always returns an empty map. We then try to create the index, and get an IndexAlreadyExistsException.\n\nJim\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
