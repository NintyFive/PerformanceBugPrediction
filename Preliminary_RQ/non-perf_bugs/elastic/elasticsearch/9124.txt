For term aggregation bucket nested with stats aggregation , remove all buckets with same stats min and stats max as same. \n2. Terms aggregation nested over stats - Remove all buckets having average less than 10\n\nSo basically as we do sorting based on path conditions , we should also be able to drop buckets.\nEg:\n\n```\n{\n    \"aggs\" : {\n        \"countries\" : {\n            \"terms\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"address.country\",\n                \"drop\" : { \"condition\" : \"females.height_stats.avg > 10 \"  }\n            },\n            \"aggs\" : {\n                \"females\" : {\n                    \"filter\" : { \"term\" : { \"gender\" : { \"female\" }}},\n                    \"aggs\" : {\n                        \"height_stats\" : { \"stats\" : { \"field\" : \"height\" }}\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above aggregation will drop all country whose average female height is more than 10. \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
