We triggered an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds -1 exception (I'll attach the stacktrace later on). \n\nIf already presumed we triggered the issue 5773 (https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/5773), but after upgrading our ES instance to 1.4.2 the same exception keeps popping up. \n\nI created a gist file.geojson https://gist.github.com/wimvanleuven/2ccf8768fedc34642b06 to verify if our GeoJSON format is correct. GitHub seems to render it correctly. \n\nIs this another bug? Thanks already for helping out!\n-wim\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
