We request bytes from a page recycler and serialized the message. When the message is written to the channel, a callback releases the bytes. This means that, by default, the `NioTransport` already includes byte array reusage for the write use case.\r\n\r\nThe read case is trickier. As read message length is unknown until a message is partially deserialized, we need some method of requesting a new byte array when we run out of space for reading. When the message has been completely read, deserialized, and dispatched, the bytes for the message can be released.\r\n\r\nI think that we do not currently want this worked to be hooked onto `BigArrays` or involve circuit breakers (based on this [comment](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/27221#issuecomment-341365639) by @jpountz). Instead we want to use the `PageRecycler` for a specific solution for the nio case.\r\n\r\nA solution for the tcp read case would ideally generalize for future protocols.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #27260 \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tbrooks8","id":862472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjQ3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/862472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrooks8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
