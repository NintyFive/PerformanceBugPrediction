Path 'hits.hits[83]._source.file_number', line 1, position 53362.\r\nUnterminated string. Expected delimiter: \".

I've seen different ending, but always starting there.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Perform a basic search that does an exact match on a keyword and limit the result set to 200 items.\r\n\r\nNot sure how to help debug this one.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisdrobison","id":1816289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTYyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1816289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrobison","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdrobison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrobison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrobison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrobison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrobison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrobison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrobison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrobison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrobison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdrobison/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
