Elastic1008 reports itself as 127.0.01? Weird, it should be 10.64.32.140. Checking the /_nodes/ API concurs, so it's not an output issue in /_cat/ as far as I can tell.\n\n Couple of things I've already checked:\n- Other nodes in the cluster all report that it's 127.0.0.1, including elastic1008\n- Yes, elastic1008 has a proper IP, and it's the same eth0 interface\n- We're not customizing any of the network settings for binding, etc.\n- Startup logs for this host clearly show it binding to the non-loopback IP: [&lt;timestamp>][INFO ][http                     ] [elastic1008] bound_address {inet[/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9200]}, publish_address {inet[/10.64.32.140:9200]}\n- It's definitely serving traffic and all the other nodes are treating it properly\n","closed_by":{"login":"demon","id":55804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/55804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demon","html_url":"https://github.com/demon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
