As shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \"field1\":\r\n   { \"sub_field1\": \"string\",\r\n     \"sub_field2\":\"string\"\r\n   },\r\n   { \"sub_field1\" :\"string\",\r\n     \"sub_field2\":\"string\"\r\n   }\r\n},\r\n{\"field2\":\r\n   { \"new_field1\": \"string\",\r\n     \"new_field2\":\"string\"\r\n},\r\n   { \"new_field1\" :\"string\",\r\n     \"new_field2\":\"string\"\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, for each \"query_str\" I have to query all these nested fields and get the max (scores) w.r.t all these fields and I have to calculate the sum of all such query_str\r\n\r\nThis problem can be broken down into two sub problems :\r\n\r\n1. For each Function Score Query, I can have different functions such that, each function should point out to each nested path. This will look some thing like below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \"query\": {\r\n  \"function_score\": {\r\n  \"functions\": [ \r\n     { \"query\":{\r\n        \"nested\": {\r\n        \"path\": \"field1\",\r\n          \"query\": {\r\n          \"filter\": {\r\n           \"term\": { \"field1.sub_field1\": \"query_str\" }}, \r\n        \"weight\": 1 }}}\r\n     },\r\n     { \"query\":{\r\n        \"nested\": {\r\n        \"path\": \"field2\",\r\n           \"query\": {\r\n           \"filter\": { \r\n             \"term\": { \"field2.new_field1\": \"query_str\" }}, \r\n           \"weight\": 1 }}}\r\n      } ],\r\n     \"score_mode\":\"max\"\r\n     } \r\n   }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n2. Nested Score_modes:- after the above query, I will get some thing like max (scores) for one query string \"query_str\". Now, I need an addition of all such maximum scores for different query strings.\r\nTo summarize mathematically,\r\n```\r\nfinal_score =\r\n      Sum on all queries ( for each_ query max ( score_on_field1, score_on_field2))\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
