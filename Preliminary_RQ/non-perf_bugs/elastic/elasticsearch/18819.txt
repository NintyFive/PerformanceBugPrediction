Aside of this is has the following purposes:\n- to shoot yourself in the food and work around how the shard-balancer allocated shards\n- to move tons of shards at once where you should have used allocation filtering and make your cluster go nuts https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18739\n- to cut your left arm off if you accidentally set `allow_primary = true`\n- to have a reason to write a script instead of unsetting `index.routing.allocation.disable_allocation` see https://github.com/alicegoldfuss/shardnado/issues/1\n\nI think this stuff needs to go. We can't offer APIs like this where basically nothing in the docs tells you:\n- this is an expert API\n- 99% of the times you are going to use it you should either user a different API, report a but or just don't mess with the cluster at all\n- use a cmd tool to repair state on disc so primaries can be allocated (we don't have that yet I know but you get the drift)\n\nI spend so much time on pulling folks out of the dirt after using this I don't think it's worth it. \n","closed_by":{"login":"hub-cap","id":613352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzM1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/613352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap","html_url":"https://github.com/hub-cap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
