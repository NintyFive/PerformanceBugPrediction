cross-cluster search configured, Kibana needs to be able to:\r\n\r\n* discover the names of the remote clusters\r\n* discover the remote cluster's `http.publish_address`\r\n* check if remote clusters are contactable\r\n\r\nThis is made more complicated by the fact that cluster settings can be `persistent`, `transient`, or `default` (configured in the `elasticsearch.yml` file).\r\n\r\nLet's add a remote cluster status API like the following:\r\n\r\n    GET _remote/status\r\n\r\nwhich could return something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"cluster_one\": {\r\n    \"seeds\": [\r\n      \"10.0.0.1:9300\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"http_addresses\": [\r\n      \"10.0.0.1:9200\",\r\n      \"10.0.0.1:9201\",\r\n      \"10.0.0.1:9202\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"connected\": true,\r\n    \"latency_in_ms\": 4,\r\n    \"connections_per_cluster\": 3,\r\n    \"initial_connect_timeout\": \"30s\",\r\n    \"level\": \"cluster|node\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"cluster_two\": {...}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `http_addresses` could be pre-configured (see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23924) or be sniffed from the remote cluster's node info.  (the same questions about HTTPS apply).\r\n\r\nThe `level` key would indicate whether this remote cluster has been configured via the cluster settings or locally on the node.","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
