This occurs because we're fetching indices using the get index API (https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/66422/files#diff-784d69eb6ea217af4edd2559d5ca2445R44), which complains about these indices' names with an error like this one:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"statusCode\":405,\r\n  \"error\":\"Method Not Allowed\",\r\n  \"message\":\"invalid escape sequence `%{[' at index 5 of: test,%{[@metadata][beat]}-%{[@metadata][version]}-2020.08.23, allowed: [PUT, DELETE, HEAD, GET]\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks similar to other problems users have reported regarding Logstash creating indices with these names (https://discuss.elastic.co/t/logstash-index-name-as-metadata-beat-metadata-version/184225). I suspect that Logstash is using the bulk API, which will allow creation of an index with this name (disallowed by the index API):\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST _bulk\r\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"%{[@metadata][beat]}-%{[@metadata][version]}-2020.08.23\", \"_id\" : \"1\" } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonable for the index API to reject invalid characters like %, [, and {, but inconsistent for the bulk API to allow them. It also seems trappy because then users can get into the situation as in the first link I shared, in which parts of the stack break for no clear reason, due to unexpected interactions between other parts of the stack.\r\n\r\nPossibly related: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48308, https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9379\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cjcenizal","id":1238659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg2NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1238659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal","html_url":"https://github.com/cjcenizal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
