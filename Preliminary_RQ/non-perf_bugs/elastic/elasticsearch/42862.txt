This means that even if `lat_long` detector was being used, the results could not be queried via any of the supported geo functionality in ES.\r\n\r\nMaking `actual` and `typical` a multi-mapped field where one is `geo_point` would cause parsing issues as the expected format between a `double` and a `geo_point` differ.\r\n\r\nWe may need to add a new field `actual_geo` and `typical_geo` that has a `geo_point` mapping. If we do this, then `record` entries would be able to be queried and aggregated as regular geo points.
