Is there any particular reason for such a few information ?\nFrom my point of view, percolation can be considered as a specific search on queries and as search API return the whole matching documents and additional information, why shouldn't it be the same for percolation, returning matching queries and additional information ? Is there any particular reason ? \nThis would prevent user from having to perform an additional get on percolation index to retrieve his needed information.\n\nFor a registered query like this : \n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_percolator/test/testquery -d '{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"term\" : {\n            \"field1\" : \"value1\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"login\" : \"XXXXXX\",\n    \"data\" : \"abcd\"\n    }\n}'\n```\n\nResponse could return something like this : \n{\"ok\" : true, \"matches\" : [{\"_id\" : \"testquery\", \"login\" : \"XXXXXX\", \"data\" : \"abcd\"}]}\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
