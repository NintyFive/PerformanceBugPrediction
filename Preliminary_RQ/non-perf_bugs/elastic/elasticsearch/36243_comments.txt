I am especially appreciative that you indicate an understanding the tension here.\r\n\r\n> I understand that setting new default config options might not be possible on older releases that are technically only getting bugfixes, and no behavior changes would be allowed.\r\n\r\nOur maintenance policy here is our guide here. We only release bug fixes to patch releases, and the 5-series is in maintenance-only mode now that the 6-series is the current major series. We avoid making enhancements to a stable branch like the 5.6 branch, so that users can rely on upgrading with minimal risk of an unstable release.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
