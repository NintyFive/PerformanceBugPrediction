(deleting the source index is one way to do it)\r\n3. After the task state becomes `failed`, send the `_stop` request without specifying `force=true` as a query parameter.\r\n4. Notice that the response status code and body format is not consistent with the usual error response format in ES APIs.","closed_by":{"login":"benwtrent","id":4357155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTcxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4357155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent","html_url":"https://github.com/benwtrent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
