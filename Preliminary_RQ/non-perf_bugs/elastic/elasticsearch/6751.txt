My goal is to get the page _visits_ out of the accesslog hits.\n\nA _visit_ is defined as following: A visit results out of one or more hits from a single ip address in a specific time frame. Due to different products on the webservers each domain should be considered separately.\n### My questions are:\n- Can this problem already be solved with build-in elasticsearch features? If **yes**, how?\n- If **no**:\n  - What kind of plugin would you suggest?\n\nMy own considerations lead from building a custom filter to retrieve just the data I need, to build a plugin which analyses the accesslog index and put the visit-data into a new index.\n\nMaybe someone can help me? I appreciate every answer. Thank you for your time!\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
