The query in your description is not a regex, it should not create an automaton (regex in query_string are created within `/ /`), so I doubt that this is the reason of the stack overflow. Is it possible that you have another query_string that contains `/ /` inadvertently ? Is it something that you want to allow (regex query) ? If not, I'd advise to always escape `/`, `/`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/394981716","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31125#issuecomment-394981716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31125","id":394981716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDk4MTcxNg==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T08:11:10Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T08:11:10Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-search-aggs","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/395029670","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31125#issuecomment-395029670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31125","id":395029670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTAyOTY3MA==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T11:02:46Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T11:02:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Searching random characters in the query_string requires to escape the [reserved characters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#_reserved_characters). If you search for urls and don't escape properly you're effectively building [regex query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#_regular_expressions). Long regex strings can cause stack overflow, we are aware of this [issue](`https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28344`). We have safeguards in 6.x to prevent long regex to kill a node, in the meantime you should use the `match` query which is simpler and doesn't require escaping.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
