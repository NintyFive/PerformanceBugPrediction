For me, the main conclusion of this discussion was that we support two very different data structures using the same elasticsearch datatype: geohashes and geo point and that's the source of many issues. Geo points are zero dimensional objects that are represented by longitude and latitude pairs. The geohashes are two dimensional objects that represent cells of geohash grid, which are stored as longitude and latitude of the bottom left point of the cell. \r\n\r\nCurrently, if we operate only using geopoints or only geohashes with the same precision everything works, but the moment we try to mix together geo points with geohashes or geohashes with different precision, the fact that geohashes are stored as a single point without precision breaks things. \r\n\r\nFor example, if we index 4 geohashes `drt70`, `drt71`, `drt40`, and `drt41` and then search for:\r\n```\r\n    \"geo_bounding_box\": {\r\n      \"pin\":\r\n      {\r\n        \"top_right\": \"drt7\",\r\n        \"bottom_left\": \"drt4\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n we will get back `drt40`, `drt41`, and `drt70` but will not get back `drt71` because our current implementation only includes My PR #30698 fixes this issue, but it introduces another issue - since the top right corner of `drt7` is the same point as the bottom left corner of `drts` with my PR the query above will also include `drts`, `drts0`, `drts00` and so on. I could modify my PR to make top right edges exclusive, but then we will get into a variation of missing edge points problem #29196 but this time for top right edge. I am not really sure what's the right way to proceed here.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/391399881","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25154#issuecomment-391399881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25154","id":391399881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTM5OTg4MQ==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-23T15:54:54Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T15:54:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> since the top right corner of drt7 is the same point as the bottom left corner of drts with my PR the query above will also include drts, drts0, drts00 and so on\r\n\r\nI think this is fine since edges of bounding boxes are supposed to be inclusive.

Of couse it is more complex than that in practice due to the fact that everything is approximate, but I'm not worried about this.\r\n\r\nI agree it's a bit weird that we accept geo hashes at index time since they are rectangles rather than points, but I think we can fix it by documentation by adding a warning that in case of geohashes, we index an arbitrary point that belongs to the geohash so users should be careful of indexing geohashes that are long enough to suit their accuracy needs.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/408466011","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25154#issuecomment-408466011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25154","id":408466011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODQ2NjAxMQ==","user":{"login":"tobias74","id":1889785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODk3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1889785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobias74","html_url":"https://github.com/tobias74","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobias74/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobias74/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobias74/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobias74/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobias74/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobias74/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobias74/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobias74/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobias74/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-27T16:10:28Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T21:04:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As @nknize pointed out he has a method that calculates top_left and bottom_right from a geohash_cell.
