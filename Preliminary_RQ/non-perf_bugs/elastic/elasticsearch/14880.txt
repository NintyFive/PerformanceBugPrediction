However I can see no way to apply this by packaging in the plugin, although I do see this is possible in master.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimmidyson","id":464659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDY1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/464659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmidyson","html_url":"https://github.com/jimmidyson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmidyson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmidyson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmidyson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmidyson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmidyson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmidyson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmidyson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmidyson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmidyson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
