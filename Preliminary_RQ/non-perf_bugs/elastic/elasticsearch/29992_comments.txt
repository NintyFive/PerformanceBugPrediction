However, quite a few Windows CI builds have succeeded since then, and this particular problem has only occurred repeatedly in the last day or so.  The working directory for the tests in CI has been changed recently, so it could be related to that.  If the temp directory is being created in parallel with running Elasticsearch then the new check is doing its job and the fix will be to change the CI setup.\r\n\r\nI will investigate further.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/384133358","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29992#issuecomment-384133358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29992","id":384133358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDEzMzM1OA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T12:37:53Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T01:36:18Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"*Original comment by @droberts195:*\n\nI had a look to see if this is still happening and the build after the most recent failure listed in the description succeeded:\r\n\r\nLINK REDACTED\r\n\r\nHowever, two builds later this Jenkins job started failing due to being unable to find Java.  Then that was fixed, but all subsequent builds failed due to being unable to find Git.\r\n\r\nI raised LINK REDACTED to get the current problem with Git resolved.  Once that's done I'll check whether the temp directory is a problem again.  But it's clear that there's been considerable churn in the scripts used to set up the Jenkins workers recently, and hopefully that was the reason behind the failure this issue was raised for rather than some problem with the Java code.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/386561403","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29992#issuecomment-386561403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29992","id":386561403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjU2MTQwMw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-04T10:26:21Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T10:26:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Relates #30325","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/386561456","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29992#issuecomment-386561456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29992","id":386561456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjU2MTQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-04T10:26:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T10:26:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This does not appear to be happening anymore.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
