The [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elastic-stack/elasticsearch/6) is better suited for this kind of question so I suggest you to open a topic there next time. \r\n\r\nRegarding your question, the `must` clauses are mandatory so your query will match documents that \"must\" contain the term `1002`. If you want to perform a real `OR`, you'll need to put the clauses under the `should` section. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
