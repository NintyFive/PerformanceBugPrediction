The original use-case for adding this was for taking the verbatim output of aggregations and feeding it into a charting library, but these days charting libraries need the data transformed anyway giving an opportunity to deal with extending the bounds and also have lots of options for extending the axes further than the data. Further the empty buckets returned by extended_bounds do not have friendly values for most of the metric aggregations (e.g. max/min/avg return null in their JSON output for empty buckets) requiring transformation of the returned buckets anyway.\r\n\r\nBecause of this should we consider removing the extended bounds option in the histogram aggregation to simplify the code and stop the tricky, non-intuitive behaviour with other features like the referenced issue above?\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24064","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
