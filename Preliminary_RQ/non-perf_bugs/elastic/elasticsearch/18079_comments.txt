Later, it was discovered that this fix introduced another leak caused by a JVM bug (https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8136353). From Groovy 2.4.5 on (we use 2.4.6 in Elasticsearch), the decision to use classvalues was reversed (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-7591). This reintroduced the old memory leak (which I guess is the one you're seeing here). You can rerevert back to the 2.4.0 - 2.4.4 groovy behavior by setting the system property `-Dgroovy.use.classvalue=true`. Note that this reintroduces the other leak. This essentially means: pick your poison. A test that I used to verify this bug report did not run into OOM issues when using `-Dgroovy.use.classvalue=true`, but that might not hold for your scripts.\n\nI would suggest that you use native scripts written in Java (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting.html#native-java-scripts).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/216256349","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18079#issuecomment-216256349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18079","id":216256349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjI1NjM0OQ==","user":{"login":"primshnick","id":9867183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjcxODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9867183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick","html_url":"https://github.com/primshnick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-02T14:51:16Z","updated_at":"2016-05-02T14:51:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1) Thanks, I'll try the system property first and see how that goes.

It is still very much \"incubating\" but it is going to the answer in the future I think. If you can live with groovy being, well, groovy until 5.0 the best thing to do is to wait for 5.0 try and port stuff to lang-painless as part of your \"migrate to 5.0\" process and file issues when you hit things it can't do. Well, that is the best thing for _us_ and I think it'd be a good choice for you too, but I'm biased.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/216601612","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18079#issuecomment-216601612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18079","id":216601612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjYwMTYxMg==","user":{"login":"primshnick","id":9867183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjcxODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9867183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick","html_url":"https://github.com/primshnick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/primshnick/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T17:19:45Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T17:19:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@nik9000 Definitely looking forward to 5.0, and will certainly move over to lang-painless!
