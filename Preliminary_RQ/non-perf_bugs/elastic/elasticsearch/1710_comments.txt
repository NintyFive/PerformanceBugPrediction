So, getting totals is difficult to do. We can potentially get the index cache size, and divide it by the number of shards active for that index in the node, to get an average per shard on that node. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/48342128","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1710#issuecomment-48342128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1710","id":48342128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MzQyMTI4","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-08T14:19:21Z","updated_at":"2014-07-08T14:19:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Index-level cache stats are now available in the indices and nodes stats APIs.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
