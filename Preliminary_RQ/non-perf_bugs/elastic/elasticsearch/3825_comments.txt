had actually seen that but I didn't realize it was intended to serve this purpose. Makes total sense now though. Perhaps we could also support a `nodes_per_machine` to save the hassle of having to manually set it. I can envision having a heterogeneous environment where you have differing numbers of cores on machines but want to provision two nodes across the board. This could prevent people from having to do the work in chef or puppet to handle all cases.

I'm thinking of use cases like:\n1.  Run a master node in a separate vm from a data node on the same machine.  `processors` would be set to `1` and `-1` respectively.\n2.  Run two data nodes on a machine with a ton of ram or two disks or something.  `processors` would both be set to `50%`.\n   And a use cases _we'd_ never attempt but I imagine others might:\n3.  Run Elasticsearch on a node also containing a db/intensive app server as some kind of demonstration node.  `processors` as is would work for this, maybe with the additional support of parsing percentages.  For most demonstration use cases this doesn't matter but I can imagine some where is might.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/51634555","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3825#issuecomment-51634555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3825","id":51634555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjM0NTU1","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T17:44:56Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T17:44:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No further interest since last year.
