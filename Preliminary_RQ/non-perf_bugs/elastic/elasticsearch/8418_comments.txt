For the use case that you describe, a simple term filter would be much more efficient.  Anyway, the parameter you're looking for is [`lowercase_expanded_terms`](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-dsl-query-string-query) which defaults to `true`.   You want to set this to `false` in this case.  (but i repeat, there are much better ways to do this)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62721062","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8418#issuecomment-62721062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8418","id":62721062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzIxMDYy","user":{"login":"sweetest","id":6868049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NjgwNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6868049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sweetest","html_url":"https://github.com/sweetest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sweetest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sweetest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sweetest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sweetest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sweetest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sweetest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sweetest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sweetest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sweetest/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-12T13:59:38Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T13:59:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the comment, I do appreciate that.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
