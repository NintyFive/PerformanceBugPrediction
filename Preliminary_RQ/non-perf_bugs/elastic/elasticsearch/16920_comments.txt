The key point is that we need to assign a small unique id to the field when we add it to the _all field so that the payload's encoding stays small. The tricky part is that this unique id cannot be automatically computed for dynamic fields. If it's in the _all field configuration then it's easy to assign one each time the configuration is updated. \nCould be something like:\n\n```\n\"_all\": {\n   \"payload_fields\": [\"text\", \"title\"]\n}\n```\n\n... but I'll need to find a better name for \"payload_field\" ;)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/290666209","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16920#issuecomment-290666209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16920","id":290666209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDY2NjIwOQ==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-31T09:34:19Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T09:34:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Index time boost are deprecated in Lucene:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-6819 and the _all field is gone.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
