Second, `jo` is not a stopword.  Third, the completion suggester is documented to start at the left side of all provided strings, and to work towards the right: the word `deep` is not on the left side of any strings.\n\nThe completion suggester is working as intended.  I suggest asking questions like these in the forum instead, as this issues list is for bug reports and feature requests.\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/66286023","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8844#issuecomment-66286023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8844","id":66286023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Mjg2MDIz","user":{"login":"mstachniuk","id":773578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzU3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/773578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstachniuk","html_url":"https://github.com/mstachniuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstachniuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstachniuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstachniuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstachniuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstachniuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstachniuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstachniuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstachniuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstachniuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-09T14:00:20Z","updated_at":"2014-12-09T14:00:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/you-complete-me/ blog post say that standard analyzer use stopwords:\n\n> Note: The added complication that stopwords brings to the suggester is also the reason why the default analyzer is the simple analyzer (which doesnâ€™t use stopwords) instead of the standard analyzer.\n\nWhat is a definition of \"stopword\"?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/66316573","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8844#issuecomment-66316573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8844","id":66316573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzE2NTcz","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-09T16:59:14Z","updated_at":"2014-12-09T16:59:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @mstachniuk \n\nThat blog post is old.
