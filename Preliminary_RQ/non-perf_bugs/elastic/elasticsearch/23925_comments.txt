Cross-cluster search will only work if all or none of the clusters are using TLS.  Of course, it is possible that TLS is enabled on the transport layer but not on the HTTP layer.\r\n\r\nOutcome of the discussion is:\r\n\r\n* if kibana is using credentials, then assume https (as we should never pass creds in the open)\r\n* if not using credentials, Kibana can issue two requests in parallel and cancel the second one once the first returns\r\n\r\nAlso, instead of configuring HTTP addresses in the elasticsearch cluster state, we'll return a list of 3 addresses sniffed from the publish address in the nodes info of the remote cluster.  If the clusters are set up with `search.remote.node.attr`, the list of http addresses will be pulled from those nodes which have the attribute.
