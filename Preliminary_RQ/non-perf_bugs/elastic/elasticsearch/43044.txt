I am pretty much successfull in it. For this, I used self signed certificates and followed the documentation given on home site of elasaticsearch. \r\n\r\nProblem is that, I am able to access HTTPS service of elasticsearch from a different working station (let's say machine X) which in the same network as the server, but machine X doesn't have the self signed certificate that I used on server machine. My doubt is how I am able to access the service of elasticsearch from X machine, since i don't have self signed certificate installed there. The whole purpose of HTTPS then goes in vain. \r\n\r\nNOTE:- I need to add exception in the browser to access elasticsearch's service as it says certificate is not trusted.
