That can't be minimised.\r\n\r\nThe other pre-allocated `Bits` objects are lightweight `BitsIntersector` objects and we pre-allocate `((N*N) - N)/2` of these with all the possible pairings of the `Bits` objects used in our collection of N filters.\r\nThese are arguably avoidable - they make the code simpler but the logic they encapsulate could be extracted into loops that iterate over the N filters.\r\n\r\nA motivation for capping the number of filters is not driven by the cost of these `BitsIntersector` objects - it will be\r\n1) The number of independent filters objects, (for the same reason Lucene Boolean queries typically set a limit of 1024 clauses to prevent excessive disk seeks).\r\n2) The number of buckets created in RAM (especially when used with child or parent aggregations).\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
