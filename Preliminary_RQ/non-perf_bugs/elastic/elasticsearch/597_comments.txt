To get the plugin to work ended up hacking files directly in the .idea/ directory so I could get Intellij to see the lucene snowball jar, for example. And setting up the paths right for main and test directories was done on the filesystem also. Failed to figure it out via the GUI. Hence this bug.\n\nBut if I get there, will make some videos.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
