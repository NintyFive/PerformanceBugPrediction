The implementation of `plugin[.bat]` thus has to separate the former from the latter when passing it to the java process.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/278329993","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13991#issuecomment-278329993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13991","id":278329993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODMyOTk5Mw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T13:34:49Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T13:34:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closed by #18207","performed_via_github_app":null}]
