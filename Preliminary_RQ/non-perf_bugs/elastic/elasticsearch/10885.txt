For example:\n\n``` shell\n$ cat requests\n{\"index\" : \"main\"}\n{ \"template\": { \"id\": \"template1\" },\"params\": { \"q\": \"foo\" } }\n{\"index\" : \"main\"}\n{ \"template\": { \"id\": \"template2\" },\"params\": { \"q\": \"bar\" } }\n\n$ curl -XGET localhost:9200/_msearch/template --data-binary @requests; echo\n```\n\nInstead I either have to make multiple requests to `/_search/template` or take our relatively large search templates and send them as extremely verbose and repetitive ad-hoc requests to `/_msearch`. If `/_msearch` or `/_msearch/template` supported template queries it would allow much cleaner and more efficient multi-search queries, and more consistency between `/_search` and `/_msearch`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"MaineC","id":70953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/70953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC","html_url":"https://github.com/MaineC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
