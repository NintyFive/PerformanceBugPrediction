Then I wrote a plugin to get the value as follows\n\nScriptDocValues docHashValues = (ScriptDocValues) doc().get(\"array\");\nfinal List<Double> tmp = ((ScriptDocValues.Doubles) docHashValues).getValues();\n\nHowever I found the tmp size is always <= 4. Is this a bug or there are some limitations for array size in ES?
