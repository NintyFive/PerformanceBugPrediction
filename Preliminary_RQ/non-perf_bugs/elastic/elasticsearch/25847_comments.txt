But it would imply that we need to have implemented all of the methods going through REST, meaning a lot more work needed before we can  even start having users go through http. Also, it would mean legacy methods that are already 5+ years old and we want to get rid of would need to be implemented. We decided to start a new client that's as close as possible to the transport client, which tries to make it easy for users to upgrade, while allowing us to clean stuff up at the same time. I hope this sounds reasonable :)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/341082864","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25847#issuecomment-341082864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25847","id":341082864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTA4Mjg2NA==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-01T11:36:52Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T11:36:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We do want to add support for these methods, the end goal is possibly feature parity with the Transport Client.
