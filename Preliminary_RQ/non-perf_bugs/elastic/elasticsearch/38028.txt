The sort field would be treated as a regular numeric field.\r\n\r\nAlso the 6.7 mapping code does not know what `type: date_nanos` is. I am not sure how a 6.7 would react here.\r\n\r\nWe could implement a simple safeguard like preventing index creation if the minimum node version is below 7 or we could port the nanosecond conversion logic to 6.7.0. Maybe there are more options that I am not seeing.\r\n\r\nAlso, this might impact current CCS refactorings.","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
