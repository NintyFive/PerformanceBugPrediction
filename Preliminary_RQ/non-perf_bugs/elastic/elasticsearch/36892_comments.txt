The stack trace and failure message indicate that this is a problem between Google SDK and GCS service, so there's nothing we can do on the Elasticsearch side to fix this. My suggestion to try with a newer ES version is that it will come with a newer Google client library version, which might be able to handle this situation better. There are two avenues to investigate here: 1) why these connection problems between Google client and Google Cloud Service are happening in the first place, and 2) whether these exceptions should be considered as retriable by the Google client (which they seemingly are not). Neither of these 2 questions can be answered by us, but only by the Google Cloud service and the Google client teams. This completes the investigation on my part, which is why I'm closing this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/454788552","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36892#issuecomment-454788552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36892","id":454788552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDc4ODU1Mg==","user":{"login":"dmnfortytwo","id":26309559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzA5NTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/26309559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo","html_url":"https://github.com/dmnfortytwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-16T14:00:53Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T14:00:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"How can I check what version of Google API library is used by plugin in my setup?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/454821897","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36892#issuecomment-454821897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36892","id":454821897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDgyMTg5Nw==","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-16T15:32:33Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T15:32:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For [ES 6.2.2, it's 1.23.0.](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v6.2.2/plugins/repository-gcs/build.gradle#L26)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/455492017","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36892#issuecomment-455492017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36892","id":455492017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTQ5MjAxNw==","user":{"login":"dmnfortytwo","id":26309559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzA5NTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/26309559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo","html_url":"https://github.com/dmnfortytwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmnfortytwo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T10:01:10Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T10:01:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"How can I use specific version of google lib?
