since https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/82d10b484a20514e70f6d773544ffea62e57f711 the forbidden API checks have been failing on the fips builds. It isn't clear if this is a problem with the build or it is revealing a real problem with our fips compliance. I'm assigning to @atorok to investigate because he made the commit that broke the builds. If it turns out that this is a problem with our compliance he'll pass it off to someone who knows more about that stuff.\r\n\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+master+matrix-java-periodic/ES_BUILD_JAVA=java10,ES_RUNTIME_JAVA=java8fips,nodes=virtual&&linux/263/console","closed_by":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
