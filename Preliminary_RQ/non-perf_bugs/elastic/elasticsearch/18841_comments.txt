We have a [dedicated discussion forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) for such questions. Can you please post your question there (the [Logstash forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/logstash) seems to fit best)? \n\nAs a hint: Elasticsearch does not know about the field `@timestamp` and hence it complains. You need to define a mapping for your index, which is (very loosely speaking) similar to a DDL statement in SQL. You also set `manage_template => false` in your Logstash configuration. [According to the docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-manage_template) this means that Logstash will not create a mapping automatically and you have to provide your own.\n\nAnother hint: You can use [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) for formatting in Github comments.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/225869939","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18841#issuecomment-225869939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18841","id":225869939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTg2OTkzOQ==","user":{"login":"DreadPirateRob","id":17660095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYwMDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17660095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob","html_url":"https://github.com/DreadPirateRob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-14T12:46:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T12:46:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Since the error occurs in the elasticsearch logs, I figured this would be the place to put this issue.

You're right; it could have also been an issue with Elasticsearch and it is sometimes hard to tell what's the root cause.\n\n> Also, I did use markdown. \n\nI just referred to the Markdown reference as you mentioned that you had trouble with the hash comments in the yml file. You can use triple backticks to start / end a multi-line block comment:\n\n``````\n# this is a multiline ...\n# preformatted block\n# that will not be broken\n# I used ``` to start the block and will now use ``` to end it again.\n``````\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/225872241","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18841#issuecomment-225872241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18841","id":225872241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTg3MjI0MQ==","user":{"login":"DreadPirateRob","id":17660095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYwMDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17660095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob","html_url":"https://github.com/DreadPirateRob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-14T12:55:51Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T12:55:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"for future reference, the question is posted here https://discuss.elastic.co/t/indices-data-read-field-stats-s-nested-illegalargumentexception-field-timestamp-doesnt-exist/52738\n\nAlso (for my fellow newbies), the forums only have a 5K character limit, so to post my question with the relevant logs & config files I had to make 5 posts in the thread just to get all the information in. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/225872425","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18841#issuecomment-225872425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18841","id":225872425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTg3MjQyNQ==","user":{"login":"DreadPirateRob","id":17660095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYwMDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/17660095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob","html_url":"https://github.com/DreadPirateRob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DreadPirateRob/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-14T12:56:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T12:56:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ahh, see I used a single backtick instead of the triple. fail on my part. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
