[...]. This is set via sysctl before starting Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n> Distributions that use systemd require that system resource limits be configured via systemd.\r\n\r\nThis means that `MAX_MAP_COUNT` is ineffective (because you're not using init.d). Also, the [maximum map count bootstrap check](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/_maximum_map_count_check.html) is intentionally not configurable from the outside so `vm.max_map_count` needs to be set to at least 262144 to pass the check.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
