This lines up with your observation with using 3 or 4 directly. I think this explains the current behaviour and I will close this issue but please reopen if you are think I'm missing something.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/546919319","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48569#issuecomment-546919319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48569","id":546919319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjkxOTMxOQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T12:13:52Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T12:13:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I agree with your explanation, it makes sense. thanks for clearing it up!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
