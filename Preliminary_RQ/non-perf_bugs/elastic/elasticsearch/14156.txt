What happend was that all queries that made use of **has_child** with the same parent type as the mapping that was removed returned zero result.\n\nExample\n\n```\n{\n   \"mappings\":{\n      \"child1\":{\n         \"properties\":{\n            \"value\":{\n               \"type\":\"string\"\n            }\n         },\n         \"_parent\":\"parent\"\n      },\n      \"child2\":{\n         \"properties\":{\n            \"value\":{\n               \"type\":\"string\"\n            }\n         },\n         \"_parent\":\"parent\"\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nQueries are made:\n\n```\nPOST host:port/index/parent/_search\n{\n   \"filter\":{\n      \"has_child\":{\n         \"type\":\"child1\",\n         \"filter\":{\n            .....\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nAnd a delete request is made to **DELETE host:port/*/child2** and suddenly the query above starts to return zero results.\n\nIs this a expected behavior? To me this seems like a bug.\nI read that in elasticsearch 2.x.x, delete a mapping will not be supported so this might be a no issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
