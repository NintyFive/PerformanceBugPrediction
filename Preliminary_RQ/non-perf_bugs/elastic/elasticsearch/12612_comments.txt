So I will say ES exec these search in parallel. There is no batch. \n\nIn addition, it might make sense not to put many requests in one multi search request, because the slowest of these queries will determine the total response time of your request and slow down all others. And also, the performance dependence on lots of factors, such as query complexity and network IO.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/127505947","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12612#issuecomment-127505947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12612","id":127505947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzUwNTk0Nw==","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-04T07:22:35Z","updated_at":"2015-08-04T07:22:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You might issue too much requests, so that the thread pools on your system (scaled by the number of CPUs) are running those requests sequentially instead of parallel.
