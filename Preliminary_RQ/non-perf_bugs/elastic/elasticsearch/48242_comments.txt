Our feeling is that we should continue with our plan of upgrading the JDK as new JDKs are released. If we were to alter our plans when JDK 14 is released, we would be left holding JDK 13, which would have reached end of life. Therefore, we would want to return to using JDK 11 (as it's LTS), a major regression. As pointed out, there is a mitigation for users that want to continue to use CMS: bring their own JDK.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
