I want information on all items; even if the optional field is missing, so I can use this code:\n\n```\nGET /missing-values/test/_search\n{\n  \"aggregations\" : {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"terms\" : {\n        \"field\" : \"optionalField\",\n        \"missing\": \"n/a\"\n      },\n      \"aggregations\" : {\n        \"test\": {\n          \"terms\" : {\n            \"field\" : \"someField\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat works fine as long as the `missing` stuff is applied on the outer level only.\nIf I change the order of the fields:\n\n```\nGET /missing-values/test/_search\n{\n  \"aggregations\" : {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"terms\" : {\n        \"field\" : \"someField\"\n      },\n      \"aggregations\" : {\n        \"test\": {\n          \"terms\" : {\n            \"field\" : \"optionalField\",\n            \"missing\": \"n/a\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI receive an exception due to internally used ordinals:\n`org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.support.MissingValues$6 cannot be cast to org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.support.ValuesSource$Bytes$WithOrdinals$FieldData`\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
