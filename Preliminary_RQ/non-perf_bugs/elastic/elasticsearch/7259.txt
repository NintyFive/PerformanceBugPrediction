The 0-30 range has 334 documents, and both the 30-60 and the 60-90  each have 333 documents.I attempted to trim the index down by using the Delete by Query API with a range query.to get rid of those documents in range 60-90. When running the query as a  search:\n\n{\n  \"query\" :\n   {\n      \"range\" :\n      {\n         \"_timestamp\" :\n         {\n            \"lt\" : \"now-1440h\"\n         }\n      }\n   }  \n}\n\nI get 333 documents yet when I run as a Delete by Query using ElasticSearch Head or using the Jest client no documents are deleted.
