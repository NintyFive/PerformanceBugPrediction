the following scenario:\n- 3 server nodes (`minimum_master_nodes=2`)\n- `node 1` detaches from `node 2` and `node 3`\n- The `client` (java) can still reach all nodes.\n\nIf the `client` chooses to connect to `node 1`, it will return an `EsRejectedExecutionException` that reports too few master nodes (since `node 1` only sees itself).\nThen, if the client did retry `node 2` or `node 3`, as if this was a connection-error, it would return a success.\nWe would prefer if the java-client could handle this type of error, just like it handles connection errors (or at least retry up to `n-q` nodes).\n\nThis could happen in a variety of ways, i.e. a 2-rack setup with a different network interface for inter-rack-communication and external communication with clients.\n\nWe've seen this scenario in our live systems, with a much simpler setup.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
