The max heap size is set to 7GB on each server. Using plugins searchguard-ssl, stats, and head.\n\n![elasticsearchgc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1820847/17036297/891bb588-4f40-11e6-85db-17f6cd25bf11.png)\n\nThis is a screenshot of the heap usage on each node over a 10 day period. You can see the normal saw-tooth pattern, but the bottom of each cycle is rising. It seems that the garbage collector frees less and less memory every time that it runs. I was having a similar issue on ES 1.7.3 and hoped that bumping to 2.3.3 would help to alleviate, but no such luck.\n\nOnce the servers get up to ~6GB of heap used for ES we do a rolling restart of the cluster which restarts the whole cycle.\n\nLet me know if there's any more information that might be useful.\n\n<!--\nIf you are filing a feature request, please remove the above bug\nreport block and provide responses for all of the below items.\n-->\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
