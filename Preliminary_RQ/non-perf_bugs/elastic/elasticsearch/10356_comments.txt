This is a good issue for getting started if you have not already contributed. Thanks for being sensitive to #5968. Just a heads up (although you shouldn't have this problem if you're mirroring the optimization from GeoDistanceFilter) be careful not to use any JTS or S4J functionality in the GeoPolygonFilter logic. This filter is used for `geo_point` types and does not require those dependencies. That's the only gotcha holding up the PR for #5968.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/171653992","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10356#issuecomment-171653992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10356","id":171653992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTY1Mzk5Mg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-14T14:12:54Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T14:12:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nknize I'm assuming this is no longer required given the new geopoints?
