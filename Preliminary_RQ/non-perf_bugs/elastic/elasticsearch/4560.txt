now doc values are enabled on a field if its fielddata format is `doc_values` at creation time of the field mapper.\n\nSo if you create a field with the `doc_values` fielddata format, then use the update mapping API to change the format to `paged_bytes` instead and restart the node, the field mapper won't know that it needs to index doc values and the `doc_values` format won't be usable anymore.\n\nI'd like to have a `doc_values` setting on the same level as `index` and `store` in the mappings that would remain true even when the field data format becomes `paged_bytes` so that doc values keep being indexed and the fielddata format can be later set to `doc_values` again.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
