After I do that, GET /index/doc/2 will/may not return the document as explained in https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-get.html#get-routing\r\n\r\nMany times I do not know the parent id until I get the document so I have to resort to a regular query.  Which is performant, but removes the simplicity of the REST interface I'm using now.\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest that there be an querystring option (eg `?routing=*` for GET (ideally also POST/PUT/DELETE) that can effectively add an \"ids\" query to get the right document, regardless of the routing.\r\n\r\nThe value of this is that it simplifies the REST use case while still allowing routing when needed.
