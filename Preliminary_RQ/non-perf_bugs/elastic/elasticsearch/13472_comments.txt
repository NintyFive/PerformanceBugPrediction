If not defined, it appears the _timestamp type is implied (and implied to have the default value of \"false\").  So, adding ?ignore_conflicts=true also allows the update mapping to go through, but can have other (undesired) consequences if you had a \"real\" conflict.  So yes, looks like a bug.  _timestamp is deprecated in 2.0 though, in favor of using a normal date field, so it may be best to treat this as a limitation in 1.x, since there is a (relatively simple) workaround.
