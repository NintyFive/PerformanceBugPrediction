It was closed because [curator](https://github.com/elastic/curator) can already do this and it's fairly easy to do so ([delete](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/delete.html) + [index selection](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index-selection.html)).  I'm going to close this issue as it seems like it's an exact duplicate of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2114.
