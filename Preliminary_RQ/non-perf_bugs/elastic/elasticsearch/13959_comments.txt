I thought about it some more, and I think it's more of an issue with Watcher & the HTML body in an email.  In that case, I want/need to html-escape by default (or use triple mustache if I don't).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/145857464","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13959#issuecomment-145857464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13959","id":145857464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTg1NzQ2NA==","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-06T13:35:11Z","updated_at":"2015-10-06T13:35:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As mustache was introduced for the search template feature, it makes sense to have the `JsonEscapingMustacheFactory` - but think about scripted fields or scripted metrics etc, where people still might be confused, when mustache does not follow the expected default behaviour.
