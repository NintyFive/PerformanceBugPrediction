As you say, the wrong action could easily bring down the whole cluster.

One issue at the moment is that these numbers are running totals, while really you need eg avg search time over the last hour.\n\n#8110 will help to make these numbers more useful, eg to calculate derivatives across time.\n\nDo you have any other ideas, or are you OK with closing this?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68395358","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6801#issuecomment-68395358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6801","id":68395358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Mzk1MzU4","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-30T20:34:22Z","updated_at":"2014-12-30T20:34:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't have any good ideas, no:)  We stuff most of those numbers in rrdtool which exposes those derivatives.
