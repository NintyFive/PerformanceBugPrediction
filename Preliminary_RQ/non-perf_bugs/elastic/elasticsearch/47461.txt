Now it is easy to set `index.query.default_field` to `*` to search in all indexed fields when no prefix field is specified in the query. This is good but it would be great if it would be possible to easily exclude one or more fields, for instance by adding `exclude_from_all:true` (defaulted to false) to those fields. \r\n\r\nNote that the introduction of `copy_to` does not solve the situation in an easy and efficient way because you need to add a new (possible large) custom field (e.g. `my_all`) and add it to all your fields: if you have and index with many fields (e.g. 100) and just want to exclude one of them this is difficult to manage and required much more disk space.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
