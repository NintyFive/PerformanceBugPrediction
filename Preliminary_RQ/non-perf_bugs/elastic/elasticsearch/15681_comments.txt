I read the docs more carefully (thanks) While the docs says:\n\n> The typical use case for cluster-wide shard allocation filtering is when you want to decommision a node, and you would like to move the shards from that node to other nodes in the cluster before shutting it down.\n\nIt then goes on to say:\n\n> Cluster-wide shard allocation filtering works in the same way as index-level shard allocation filtering (see Index Shard Allocation for details).\n\nAnd the index level shard allocation did _not_ reallocate shards.  \n\nThe docs for 1.7 at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/index-modules-allocation.html seems to say this should work:\n\n> The provided settings can also be updated in real time using the update settings API, allowing to \"move\" indices (shards) around in realtime.\n\nBut it didn't work for me.   I change the settings for a particular index to exclude on a node (tried both ip and host exclusion) and waited 15-20 minutes on an idle cluster but nothing happened.  \n\nAny suggestions?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
