That's by design. The specific error that you get is caused by nodes with x-pack installed sending over the network x-pack related info that the nodes without x-pack cannot decipher, hence the failure.\r\n\r\nYou can either do a full cluster restart, meaning that rolling upgrade will not work, or remove x-pack from the 5.6 nodes before starting the rolling upgrade.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
