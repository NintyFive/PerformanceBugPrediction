Perhaps the documentation for the More Like This Query is in need of some larger updates overall.\r\n\r\nOriginal issue:\r\n~~Currently the More Like This Query can operate on two types of input: text via the **like** and **unlike** parameters, or full documents through the **ids** parameter.~~\r\n\r\n~~The **ids** parameter allows you to input a number of document ids into the query which will return documents similar to the ones provided. There is however, in contrast to the text input options, no way to provide document IDs for documents unlike the desired results.~~\r\n\r\n~~I propose we break out the ids parameter into two parameters, much like the text parameters:~~\r\n- ~~likeIds~~\r\n- ~~unlikeIds~~\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
