In the documentation it is `/{index}/_mapping/{type}` (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-put-mapping.html) \n\nShouldn't the REST API Spec make it clear the order of preference?   Is the `url.path` element supposed to mark the preferred item from `url.paths`?  It doesn't in this case either. \n\nAre all the forms in `url.paths` really valid?  Some are not documented.  Are they old deprecated forms?  If so, marking them deprecated would be useful as well.  \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
