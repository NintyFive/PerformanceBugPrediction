I am trying to collect jmx metrics from flink through the jolokia module and lack of wildcard support makes it unusable. Jolokia does support wildcard in it's queries. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1. Setup Jolokia metric beat module\r\n 2. Use jmx mapping similar to what is shown below. \r\n```\r\njmx.mappings:\r\n       mbean: 'Catalina:name=*,type=ThreadPool'\r\n       attributes:\r\n                  attr: maxConnections\r\n                  field: max_connections 3. \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\nError observed when using wildcard\r\n\r\n` errors: metric key '' not found in response; metric key '' not found in response`\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
