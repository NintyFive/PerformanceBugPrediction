The query for the left half polygon returns 0 record, while the query for right half polygon returns all the records, which is 824. \nAnd then I tried a query for an even smaller polygon, which is about 1/20 of the right half and inside the right half, it also returns 824 hits. So there must be something wrong here, can anyone tell me the possible reason?\n\nP.S. I didn't set **precision** option, which value would be 1cm by default, I think this is accurate enough. I also didn't set **lat_lon** and **geo_hash** which means they are all false by default, but according to the document [here](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-geo-point-type.html), setting these two values can only help the query more efficient, they have nothing to do with the accuracy.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
