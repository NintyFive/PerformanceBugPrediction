That'll at least be a work around if it works.\n\nA couple of other thoughts:\n1. A prefix query should also work.\n2. I'd normalize the `+` out of the phone number on the way in.\n3. You will get better performance if you extract the area code to its own field. A prefix or a regex query has to walk through lots of terms but if you extract the country code to a field it'll be a single term lookup. Depending on your use case you might also want to extract stuff like npa for NANPA numbers as well.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/196490006","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17098#issuecomment-196490006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17098","id":196490006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjQ5MDAwNg==","user":{"login":"tebriel","id":821688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTY4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/821688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tebriel","html_url":"https://github.com/tebriel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tebriel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tebriel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tebriel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tebriel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tebriel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tebriel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tebriel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tebriel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tebriel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"created_at":"2016-03-14T19:39:31Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T19:39:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nik9000:\n\n### Character Class\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"regexp\": {\n      \"data.cid_info.e164\": \"^[+]44.*\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"fields\": [\"data.cid_info.e164\"],\n  \"size\": 0\n}\n```\n\n0 hits still\n\n### Prefix Query\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"prefix\": {\n      \"data.cid_info.e164\": \"+44\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"fields\": [\"data.cid_info.e164\"],\n  \"size\": 10\n}\n```\n\nOddly also 0 hits.\n\n```\n{\n  \"_shards\": {\n    \"failed\": 0,\n    \"successful\": 2,\n    \"total\": 2\n  },\n  \"hits\": {\n    \"hits\": [],\n    \"max_score\": null,\n    \"total\": 0\n  },\n  \"timed_out\": false,\n  \"took\": 1\n}\n```\n\n### Reworking of how data is stored\n\nYeah, totally get that.
