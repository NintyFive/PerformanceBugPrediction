However if the missing node comes back we then recover whatever shards existed on it via dangling indices.\n\nIt seems that if a user requests an index to be deleted, having those other shards come back is aberrant  behaviour and instead we should make note that some shards are not available, and if/when they come back they are then also deleted (maybe add a timeout value to that as well?).\n\nSure, the user could turn dangling indices off, but that seems incomplete and still leaves the data on disk when it's obviously not wanted - presuming that node comes back of course.\n","closed_by":{"login":"brwe","id":4320215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjAyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4320215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe","html_url":"https://github.com/brwe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
