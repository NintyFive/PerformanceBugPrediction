We implemented a generic mechanism for sourcing secrets from files instead of environment variables, by settings `SECRET_VAR_FILE` (holding a file name) to populate `SECRET_VAR`.\r\n\r\nHowever, as far as I can tell there are only really two variables where we might want this behaviour. We could apply this mechanism only for recognised variables. @jasontedor what do you think? I think that would be better than skipping processing of `_FILE` variables that don't point to files.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
