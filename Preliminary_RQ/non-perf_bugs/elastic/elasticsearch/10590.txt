have an Elasticsearch 1.5.0 environment with 3 nodes and 3 shards of each index.\n\nI have the following document indexed:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"_index\": \"content-1\",\n  \"_type\":

\"docs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever when I make queries and combine it with using the missing field filter the actual missing field filter is not being used.\n\n``` json\nPOST /content/_search\n{\n

]\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nResponse output for that query:\n\n``` json\n {\n   \"took\": 38,\n   \"timed_out\": false,\n   \"_shards\": {\n      \"total\": 6,\n      \"successful\": 6,\n      \"failed\": 0\n   },\n   \"hits\": {\n      \"total\": 1,\n      \"max_score\": 1.8740479,\n      \"hits\": [\n         {\n            \"_index\": \"content-1\",\n            \"_type\":

document, since I am querying for document that has missing field values in the specific field 'nativeAdCampaignName'.\n\nThe field I'm unable to use with missing field is indeed indexed, i.e. I can search on that field and have the document returned.\n\n(A problematic implication is that I cannot reproduce this problem in a local single-node environment running same ES version and mapping. There's different JVM versions and difference in number of nodes though.)\n\nThis environment runs on OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, 1.7.0_75.\n\nAny ideas why this happens?\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
