When adding fields with dots, for example `afield.number`, then, when indexing a document \n\n```\n\"afield\": {\n    \"number\": 4\n}\n```\n\nthe type of `\"afield\": { \"number\":` is found correctly, but a second mapping for the object is added. This happens even if the indexing operation fails in case the type of `\"afield\": { \"number\":` does not correspond with `\"afield.number\"` as defined in the mapping.\n\nAn example is here: https://gist.github.com/brwe/11394327\n\nThere are two issue with this:\n1. In STEP 2 (indexing the object) the indexing operation is rejected but the mapping for the object is still added. I do not think this should be so (This might be related to [#5798](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/5798))\n2. It seems to me that when creating or merging mappings, it should be checked if pathes exist twice. For example, the following yields no error:\n\n```\nPUT /testindex/sometype/_mapping\n{\n   \"sometype\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n         \"afield.number\": {\n            \"type\": \"integer\"\n         },\n         \"afield.text\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n         },\n         \"afield\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n               \"number\": {\n                  \"type\": \"string\"\n               }\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
