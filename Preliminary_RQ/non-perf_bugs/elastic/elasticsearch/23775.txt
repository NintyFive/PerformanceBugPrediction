Some examples of this would be:\r\n\r\n- Scripted fields with a custom date format\r\n- Scripted aggregation (though date histogram is better/easier)\r\n- Watcher outputs (expose the date in a custom format)\r\n\r\nIt would be great to add some examples in the documentation around how to manipulate dates. Most of the examples show that the `SimpleDateFormat` is very useful in Java to do this, however this is not available in Painless (right?).\r\n\r\nRelates: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22720","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
