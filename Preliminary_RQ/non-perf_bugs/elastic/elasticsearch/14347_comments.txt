We're under CentOS 7. Each ES instances had its own configuration file and environments variables. The conf file to use is specified in the service section of each instances startup script (/usr/lib/systemd/system/elasticsearch-node1.service, node2.service, etc.) by using the es.config parameter. We had to tweak a bit the systemd scripts but it does the job.\n\nNow ,we are settings up a test environment to migrate under 2.0. How can we have multiple instances running on the same system with different conf files with 2.0 if we cannot specify a conf file?
