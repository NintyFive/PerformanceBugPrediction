issue is similar to, but distinct from, https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39284.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Reproduce\r\n---\r\n1) Set up a 5.x cluster\r\n2) Create at least one Watch that runs periodically\r\n3) Upgrade the cluster to 6.7\r\n4) Reindex the `.watches` index using the Kibana Upgrade assistant\r\n5) Create a new periodic watch.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: The newly created Watch will be executed on schedule, as will existing watches.\r\n\r\n**Observed behavior**: The newly created Watch will not run, although existing Watches will continue to run as expected.\r\n\r\nUpdates to existing Watches work normally, but deleting a Watch will cause warnings in the logs that the Watch cannot be found.\r\n\r\nThis can also be reproduced by switching the `.watches` alias to point to a new index that does not start with `.watches`, even if not using the Upgrade Assistant.\r\n\r\nCause\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen Kibana reindexes the `.watches-6` index, it is reindexed to <INDEX_NAME>. Watcher [sets up a listener](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/9be914cfece721d630abc875d54bd9184788369f/x-pack/plugin/watcher/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/watcher/Watcher.java#L579-L581) on indices which have names that start with `.watches` to pick up newly created or deleted Watches.  \r\n\r\nSolution\r\n---\r\n\r\nInstead of using a prefix, Watcher should listen on whichever index is pointed to by the `.watches` alias.\r\n\r\nWorkaround\r\n---\r\nAfter adding a Watch, stopping and starting Watcher will cause the new Watch to be executed as expected, although this must be done each time Watches are added.","closed_by":{"login":"gwbrown","id":1522844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjI4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1522844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/gwbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
