If the server has a AAAA-record, the plugin-installer should try IPv6 first (if not link-local), then IPv4, or at least provide configuration-options for use IPv4 or IPv6, or prefer IPv6 over IPv4 and vice versa.\n\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3484\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Install Elasticsearch 2.2.1 on a system with private IPv4 address and a public IPv6 address\n2. Install a plugin `/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin install --batch discovery-multicast`\n3. Fails with `Failed: ConnectException[Network is unreachable]`\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n\n```\n1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN\n    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet6 ::1/128 scope host\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n2: ens160: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen 1000\n    link/ether 00:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 192.168.100.20/24 scope global ens160\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet6 yyyy:yyy:yyyy:yyyy:yyy::yy/64 scope global\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet6 fe80::20c:xxxx:xxxx:952c/64 scope link\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n```\n\n```\ndig download.elastic.co AAAA\n...\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\ndownload.elastic.co.    60      IN      CNAME   dualstack.download-colb-770446651.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.\ndualstack.download-colb-770446651.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. 60 IN AAAA 2406:da00:ff00::b848:f489\ndualstack.download-colb-770446651.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. 60 IN AAAA 2406:da00:ff00::b849:ab32\ndualstack.download-colb-770446651.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com. 60 IN AAAA 2406:da00:ff00::b849:ba57\n...\n```\n\n<!--\nIf you are filing a feature request, please remove the above bug\nreport block and provide responses for all of the below items.\n-->\n","closed_by":{"login":"aholen","id":3923969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjM5Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3923969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholen","html_url":"https://github.com/aholen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aholen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
