This works fine for 'normal' (here: my_field1) fields, but fails for nested fields (here: my_field2.my_subfield).\n\nSample mapping:\n\n```\n{\n  \"my_index\": {\n    \"mappings\": {\n      \"my_type\": {\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"my_field1\": {\n            \"type\": \"date\",\n            \"format\": \"strict_date_optional_time||epoch_millis\"\n          },\n          \"my_field2\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"my_subfield\": {\n                \"type\": \"date\",\n                \"format\": \"epoch_millis||dateOptionalTime\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nIm am trying to update the field format for the nested date field my_subfield like this:\n\n```\nPUT /my_index/_mapping/my_type?update_all_types \n{\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"my_field2.my_subfield\": {\n      \"type\": \"date\",\n      \"format\": \"strict_date_optional_time||epoch_millis\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nand receive this error:\n\n```\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"root_cause\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"mapper_parsing_exception\",\n        \"reason\": \"Field name [my_field2.my_subfield] cannot contain '.'\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"type\": \"mapper_parsing_exception\",\n    \"reason\": \"Field name [my_field2.my_subfield] cannot contain '.'\"\n  },\n  \"status\": 400\n}\n```\n\nI understand that from 2.0 onwards, field names may no longer contain a dot in their name - but this is no field with a dot in the name but a nested field.\n","closed_by":{"login":"peteradh","id":18051095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDUxMDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/18051095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteradh","html_url":"https://github.com/peteradh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteradh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteradh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteradh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteradh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteradh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteradh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteradh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteradh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peteradh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
