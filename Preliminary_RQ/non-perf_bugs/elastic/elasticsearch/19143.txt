I made an example available on found.no:\nhttps://www.found.no/play/gist/667e4d974fe0f0045e5c0b5e44e47b06\n\nBasically I would like to filter completion suggester by some criteria (like organization tenancy, etc.). \nI saw that a context extension is available on completion query.\n\nI would like to know if it's a bug or if completion suggester doesn't take in account query, filter, post_filter, etc.? Should we use context to filter suggestions?\n\nI tried on different versions, especially Elasticsearch 2.3.3.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\nhttps://www.found.no/play/gist/667e4d974fe0f0045e5c0b5e44e47b06\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
