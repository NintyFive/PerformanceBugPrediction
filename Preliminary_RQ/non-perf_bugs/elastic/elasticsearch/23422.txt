One is for high-frequency calls, and the other is normal. The two groups are isolated to prevent the normal group from being affected. I split the cluster using following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a elasticsearch cluster with four datanodes, two are high-frequency calls, and two are normal.\r\ndata-1: node.attr.cluster: highfreq\r\ndata-2: node.attr.cluster: normalfreq\r\ndata-3: node.attr.cluster: highfreq\r\ndata-4: node.attr.cluster: normalfreq\r\n\r\n2. Create a new index, routing to two groups\r\nPUT /ztest\r\n{\r\n\"settings\": {\r\n\"number_of_shards\": 3,\r\n\"number_of_replicas\": 1,\r\n\"index.routing.allocation.include.cluster\": \"highfreq,normalfreq\"\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n3.Make sure that each group has a complete copy of shards.\r\nPUT /_cluster/settings\r\n{\r\n\"persistent\" : {\r\n\"cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes\" : \"cluster\"\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n4.Specify the group when querying\r\nGET /ztest/_search?preference=cluster:highfreq\r\nGET /ztest/_search?preference=cluster:normal\r\n\r\nIt seems to work properly: \r\n\r\n![normal](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2605076/23444513/956f6890-fe70-11e6-8ad0-f1da87c07593.png)\r\n\r\n5. But sometimes I want to allocate the index only in normal group(this often occurs in some scenarios):\r\nPUT /ztest\r\n{\r\n\"settings\": {\r\n\"number_of_shards\": 3,\r\n\"number_of_replicas\": 1,\r\n\"index.routing.allocation.include.cluster\": \"normalfreq\"\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\nThen only primary shards can be allocated, and the replication shards are unassigned, although there is still a spare resource of one data-node: \r\n![error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2605076/23444521/a13e2238-fe70-11e6-87d0-bfc03414411a.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
