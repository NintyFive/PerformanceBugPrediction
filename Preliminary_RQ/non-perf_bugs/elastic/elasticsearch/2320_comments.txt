We will not start shipping an own version of elasticsearch for each binary type, so maybe we can disable certain warnings (the way RPM does it) or we will have to live with it. We are using these library files only if we are on the right architecture anyway.\n\nRegarding the copyright file, it might make sense to copy the included copyright file to the correct destination.\n\nNot sure about the control file issue, but maybe I can take a look at it as well.\n\nDo you agree?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
