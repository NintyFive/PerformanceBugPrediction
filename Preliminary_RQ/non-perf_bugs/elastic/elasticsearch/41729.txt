Put a note at the top of this page to indicate that ILM will automatically order the actions within a phase, i.e., users do not have to worry about what actions to list first in a phase.  In fact, users cannot influence the ordering themselves.  And that the actions listed within each phase on this page are in the order consistent with the automatic ordering (see part 2 below).\r\n\r\n2.  Currently, on this page, we list the actions within each phase in an undetermined order.  It will be helpful to list these using an ordering that is consistent with the automatic ordering used in our code.  \r\n\r\nFor example, for warm phase, the automatic ordering is:  Unfollow, SetPriority, Allocate, ForceMerge, ReadOnly, Shrink.  \r\n\r\nBut these actions are listed in the doc in the order: SetPriority, Allocate, ReadOnly, ForceMerge, ShrinkAction, Unfollow\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
