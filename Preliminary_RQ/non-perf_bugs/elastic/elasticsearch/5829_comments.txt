already exposed the min/max APIs added in LUCENE-5860, on an index level, but for this issue nothing has been done to e.g. optimize range filters based on the min/max of a segment, because it's currently too costly for Lucene's postings APIs to compute the max numeric value: it requires a binary search over the terms because of how the numeric prefix terms are encoded.\n\nOnce we cutover to auto-prefix encoding for numeric terms, this becomes much cheaper and I think optimizations like this become more realistic.\n\nI think higher level optimizations could be very worthwhile, e.g. for time-based indices, knowing that a given index won't have any hits because there is a top-level range filter, should be a big speed up in many cases ... there is a separate issue to explore this but I can't find it right now.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/242100900","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5829#issuecomment-242100900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5829","id":242100900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjEwMDkwMA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T15:15:17Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T15:15:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The
