This could work, but there is currently no sidebar or easy way to navigate around the different functionality. The only way to use it at the moment is to do a \"find on page\" or scroll endlessly until you find what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nThe previous way was to have each concept on a separate page, which was much easier to use because we could find the different pages on the right sidebar. But even that had its downsides because the sidebar was still static and stuck to the top of the page.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what caused the recent changes, but this is definitely a step back as far as usability goes for a user who is simply researching different ways to use the search request body functionality- or doing a quick skim to review functionality they have forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe areas I've noticed this most pronounced is the Search Request Body documentation, and the JavaScript client documentation (because I use these quite often) : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/api-reference.html\r\n\r\n## Suggestion:\r\n\r\nA fixed, scrollable sidebar which links to each header and sub-header for the current page's information. As well as a separate fixed sidebar for other documentation pages.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud does this really well on their documentation site. For reference of what I'm talking about: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax\r\n\r\nThis makes life so much easier - I feel much more freedom in navigating the docs and have a much better overview of information at my finger-tips at all times. It definitely aids in learning and discovery of new ways to use the product.","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
