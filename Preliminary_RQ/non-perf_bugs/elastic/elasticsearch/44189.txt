the ILM explain API provides an explanation for all indices regardless of whether they are managed by ILM or not.\r\n\r\nIt can be helpful to provide a few additional (optional) filtering parameters to this API (examples):\r\n- `managed=true|false` so that admins can quickly filter out indices that are not managed by ILM to begin with\r\n- `error=true|false` so that admins can quickly return just
