While we understand the appeal of this, and how for some users like yourself it might be \"frustrating and painful\" to not have it, ultimately we do think this is not friendly to most of our users and would create more problems than it solves.\r\n\r\nElasticsearch currently has hundreds of settings (something on the order of 300, I am not sure, and it's continuing to grow as we add more functionality). The vast majority of these *never* need be touched by a user (if they do, we think it's a bug) and then some users need settings for one module (e.g., Security) while another set needs another (e.g., Watcher) and so on. For the really common settings, we aim to pick good defaults. \r\n\r\nListing all settings in a single page, or in a reference elasticsearch.yml only encourages fiddling with settings. We also do not think that is the right way to consume settings. That is, scanning a list of hundreds of settings and their default values doesn't really help users solve their problems. Instead, we want to focus on high-quality settings documentation and feedback in the software so that when a user has a problem (e.g., \"how do I increase the size of a thread pool\") they can either find these by search and find the settings page for the relevant module (e.g., documentation for machine learning) or the software tells them \"what you are using is deprecated, set this setting now to start using the non-deprecated behavior\").","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/421834201","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33741#issuecomment-421834201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33741","id":421834201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTgzNDIwMQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-16T21:10:05Z","updated_at":"2018-09-16T21:10:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Relates #11504, relates #26251","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/421834810","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33741#issuecomment-421834810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33741","id":421834810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTgzNDgxMA==","user":{"login":"fbaligand","id":3750300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTAzMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3750300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand","html_url":"https://github.com/fbaligand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-16T21:14:24Z","updated_at":"2018-09-16T21:14:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, thanks for the explanation.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/421836815","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33741#issuecomment-421836815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33741","id":421836815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTgzNjgxNQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-16T21:29:56Z","updated_at":"2018-09-16T21:29:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Elasticsearch currently has hundreds of settings (something on the order of 300, I am not sure, and it's continuing to grow as we add more functionality).\r\n\r\nI looked into this.
