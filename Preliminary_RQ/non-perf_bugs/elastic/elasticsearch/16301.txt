5.3.2 came out, so we updated it to get the fix.\n\nElasticsearch then stopped working, because there is this check in `Version.java`:\n\n```\n        assert CURRENT.luceneVersion.equals(Lucene.VERSION) : \"Version must be upgraded to [\" + Lucene.VERSION + \"] is still set to [\" + CURRENT.luceneVersion + \"]\";\n```\n\nThis basically prevents us updating Lucene to get any bugfixes at all unless we turn off assertions to work around it, which is probably the better option, but still irritates me somehow.\n\nIf Elasticsearch does depend on 5.3.1 specifically then it should probably be using Version.LUCENE_5_3_1 and not checking Version.LATEST and then complaining if it happens to be newer.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
