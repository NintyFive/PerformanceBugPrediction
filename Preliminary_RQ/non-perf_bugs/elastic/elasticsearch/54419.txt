For example, `length` will return `0` if there is an empty string or non-existent string. Should `length` return `null` instead of 0?\r\n\r\nA more interesting scenario is the one of functions that return a boolean value (`startsWith` is one of them) that receive a `null` parameter? Should they return `null` or  a `true`/`false` value?\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53999:\r\n\r\n> null behavior:\r\n> \r\n> wildcard(missing/null, ...) ==> null\r\n> wildcard(string, ...) => true or false\r\n> wildcard(non-null, non-string) => null (if necessary)\r\n> this shouldn't be possible when compiling to match and using an indexed field. but can we query non-indexed fields? would a document ever have a non-string value?\r\n\r\nThe above suggestion does bring forth another scenario: functions dealing with data types they are not supposed to deal with - should the function return `null` or a \"lenient\" value (like 0 in the case of `length(integer)` for example) or throw an exception?\r\n\r\nI created this issue to open discussion and reach a conclusion about \"null\" handling (both as parameters and as a return value) in ES EQL:\r\n- functions dealing with `null` parameters should return `null` or a default value depending on the function?\r\n- functions dealing with parameter types other than the ones supported by those functions should be \"silent\" about this incompatibility and return a default value or throw an exception?\r\n- the decision to return `null` should probably be accompanied by the introduction of a new function, that should check for a `null` value. Otherwise, the `null` output of functions will not be useful in queries","closed_by":{"login":"astefan","id":893749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/893749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan","html_url":"https://github.com/astefan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
