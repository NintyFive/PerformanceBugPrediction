is reserved for bug reports and feature requests; it is not the place\r\nfor general questions. If you have a question or an unconfirmed bug , please\r\nvisit the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).  Please also\r\ncheck your OS is [supported](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#show_os).\r\nIf it is not, the issue is likely to be closed.\r\n\r\nFor security vulnerabilities please only send reports to security@elastic.co.\r\nSee https://www.elastic.co/community/security for more information.\r\n\r\nPlease fill in the following details to help us reproduce the bug:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): Snapshot of latest building artifact at time of issue creation `elasticsearch-oss-8.0.0-SNAPSHOT-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz`\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`): openjdk 12.0.2 2019-07-16\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system): Darwin 19.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 19.5.0: Tue May 26 20:41:44 PDT 2020; root:xnu-6153.121.2~2/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nWhen creating a snapshot policy users are given the option to include global state, by setting `include_global_state` to `true`. Creating a snapshot policy like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT _slm/policy/test-k\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"<test-k-{now/d}>\",\r\n  \"schedule\": \"0 30 1 * * ?\",\r\n  \"repository\": \"test\",\r\n  \"config\": {\r\n    \"indices\": [\r\n      \".k*\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"include_global_state\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd running it yields a snapshot that also contains all the data streams metadata. Even though there are no data streams in the policy that match the patterns specified in `indices`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when attempting to restore a snapshot created with the above policy the following error is reported:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[index_not_found_exception] no such index [.ds-test-data-stream-000001], with { index_uuid=\"_na_\" & index=\".ds-test-data-stream-000001\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect the policy snapshot to not include _any_ data about data streams (as it does not contain any of the backing indices either).\r\n\r\nI would also expect the snapshot to be restore-able.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n#### Create an index template\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT /_index_template/test-data-stream\r\n{\r\n\t\"index_patterns\": [\r\n\t\t\"test-data-stream*\"\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"template\": {\r\n\t\t\"mappings\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"properties\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"@timestamp\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"date\"\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"data_stream\": {\r\n\t\t\"timestamp_field\": \"@timestamp\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Create a data stream\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT /_data_stream/test-data-stream\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Then...\r\n\r\nAfter the policy has created the snapshot, inspect the data concerning that snapshot, it should contain information about he data stream that was just created (which it should not).\r\n\r\n#### Do the restore\r\n\r\nI was using the Kibana UI to restore the snapshot and required that the global metadata be included in the snapshot\r\n\r\n\r\nCC @martijnvg ","closed_by":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
