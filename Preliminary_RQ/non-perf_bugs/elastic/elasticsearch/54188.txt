Historically this performed better than using a `RAMDirectory` because the latter had fairly heavy synchronization around both indexing and querying.  However, we now have a replacement in-memory directory implementation, `ByteBuffersDirectory`, which does not have this heavy synchronization.  MemoryIndex has some drawbacks, such as the lack of a cache helper or close listeners, which can cause odd failures when queries use fielddata.  We should investigate removing MemoryIndex entirely in the percolator and see if there is still a performance penalty when using `ByteBuffersDirectory` for a single document percolate query.","closed_by":{"login":"romseygeek","id":1347065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDcwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1347065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek","html_url":"https://github.com/romseygeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
