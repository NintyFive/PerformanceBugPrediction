See below for a sample log message. There is nothing special in our setup. We have separated master/client/data nodes. We have two index templates, one which matches all indexes \"*\" at priority 0 and one for each dedicated index, e.g. \"storage-*\" at priority 1. Each of those index templates defines some index properties (that don't overlap), as well as some mapping properties and dynamic mapping templates, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"long_fields\": {\r\n    \"mapping\": {\r\n      \"doc_values\": true,\r\n      \"type\": \"long\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"match_mapping_type\": \"long\",\r\n    \"match\": \"*\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue only affects *some* logs in each index. The logs it affects don't have anything special in their content either. The error appears to be erroneous, but any insight would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Run elasticsearch cluster\r\n 2. Index data\r\n 3. See problem\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n```\r\n[2017-05-17 17:43:51,725][DEBUG][action.bulk              ] [d-d08p03r05u05-t0g2] [storage-2017.05.17][0] failed to execute bulk item (index) index {[storage-2017.05.17][events][AVwXgkKowptZJ_-jLodQ], source[REDACTED_JSON_SOURCE]}\r\nMapperParsingException[failed to parse]; nested: PatternSyntaxException[Dangling meta character '*' near index 0\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
