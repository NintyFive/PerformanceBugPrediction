It seems too there is a broken recovery for one shard (among 5 for the same index). In the #8707 they suggest it could be resolved by renaming the shard directory. The 'unassigned' replica would become primary so data could be accessible again and a new replica created. Can someone confirm that.\n\nbleskes : do you suggest the #8707 error would not happen in a 1.5.0 version ?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/103854103","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10066#issuecomment-103854103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10066","id":103854103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzg1NDEwMw==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-20T11:41:47Z","updated_at":"2015-05-20T11:41:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nguafogu78 1.5 fixes that type of corruption when it happens due to a recovery/relocation which is abruptly cut.
