The documentation supports the behavior. The aggregation in the example is on a field named \"city.raw\":\n\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-fields.html\n\nThe unit tests in the code look for field names with dots: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/2.1/core/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/index/mapper/multifield/MultiFieldTests.java#L88\n\nThe tests pass because the check in ObjectMapper$TypeParser only checks the original name.\n\nThe field name is built in ContentPath:\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/2.1/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/mapper/ContentPath.java#L50\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/2.1/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/mapper/ContentPath.java#L80-L87\n\nThese field names will fail if the indices are run through the MetaDataIndexUpgradeService.
