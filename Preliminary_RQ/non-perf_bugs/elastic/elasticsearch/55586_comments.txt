The initial file analysis now finds the time format.\r\n\r\nHowever, I found that round-tripping a file through the Discover view's CSV export back to ML's file upload still required a bit of manual intervention because the export contains fields `_id` and `_index` which are not permitted in ingested documents, so these need to be renamed in the column name overrides.\r\n\r\nSo there's still a question about what we should do when importing a file that already has `_id` and/or `_index` fields.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/618227140","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55586#issuecomment-618227140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55586","id":618227140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODIyNzE0MA==","user":{"login":"blookot","id":30144076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTQ0MDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/30144076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blookot","html_url":"https://github.com/blookot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blookot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blookot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blookot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blookot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blookot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blookot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blookot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blookot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blookot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-23T07:20:26Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T07:20:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you @droberts195 !\r\njust a quick comment: the way we usually export CSV is by creating a saved search having only a few columns selected (out of all the fields), so _id and _index are not exported.\r\nStill there is an issue on numeric fields export, see https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/64170\r\nBut indeed, my goal is to easily export in csv and share the csv for others to reimport via data visualizer ;-)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
