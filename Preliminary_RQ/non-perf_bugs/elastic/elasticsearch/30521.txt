This second criteria isn't necessarily applicable to our current set though (the example given is the definition of two integral types, one auto-incrementable, which would need to be ordered as second, since auto-incrementing property is not specific to an ODBC integral type).","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
