Ever since then, we are seeing the error below.\n\nAny comments?\n\nI looked at ES code and see this newly added line for EXTERNAL_GTE. Does it mean we dont support zero as a valid version number? Our systems use zero as the start version number.\n\nAlso to add: it seems that even VersionType.EXTERNAL is also broken in the new version (1.1.0) since it now does the validation of input version number and it does not allow a save if the input version number is zero.\nLooking for inputs from ES team on how to proceed on this.\n\n```\n       @Override\n        public boolean validateVersion(long version) {\n            return version > 0L;\n        }\n\norg.elasticsearch.action.ActionRequestValidationException: Validation Failed: 1: illegal version value [0] for version type [EXTERNAL_GTE];\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.ValidateActions.addValidationError(ValidateActions.java:29)\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.index.IndexRequest.validate(IndexRequest.java:181)\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.TransportActionNodeProxy.execute(TransportActionNodeProxy.java:63)\n    at org.elasticsearch.client.transport.support.InternalTransportClient$2.doWithNode(InternalTransportClient.java:109)\n    at org.elasticsearch.client.transport.TransportClientNodesService.execute(TransportClientNodesService.java:228)\n    at org.elasticsearch.client.transport.support.InternalTransportClient.execute(InternalTransportClient.java:106)\n    at org.elasticsearch.client.support.AbstractClient.index(AbstractClient.java:82)\n    at org.elasticsearch.client.transport.TransportClient.index(TransportClient.java:330)\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.index.IndexRequestBuilder.doExecute(IndexRequestBuilder.java:314)\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.ActionRequestBuilder.execute(ActionRequestBuilder.java:85)\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.ActionRequestBuilder.execute(ActionRequestBuilder.java:59)\n```\n\n-Amit\n","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
