In this case I set invalid values for the following configurations in elasticsearch.yml : \n\n```\n# incorrect values because booleans have to be lowercase\nnode.master: True\nnode.data: True\ndiscovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false\ndiscovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [\"localhost\"]\n```\n\nBut elastic search starts and I am able to see the following cluster nodes:\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9200/_nodes/http?pretty=true\n{\n  \"cluster_name\" : \"elasticsearch\",\n  \"nodes\" : {\n      ...\n      \"attributes\" : {\n        \"master\" : \"True\",\n        \"data\" : \"True\"\n      },\n     ...\n    },\n```\n\nThe only indication when I get that there is a problem is when I try to run other commands to access the data in the cluster. This is the error that I get back when I try to add a mapping to my_index:\n\n```\ncurl -X PUT localhost:9200/my_index -d @mapping.json'\n{\"error\":\"MasterNotDiscoveredException[waited for [30s]]\",\"status\":503}\n```\n\nIn this case, it would be useful to fail server start if there is an incorrect parameter or issue some sort of warning or have it logged.
