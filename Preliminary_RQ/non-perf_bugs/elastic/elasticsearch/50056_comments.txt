For example, someone who starts with a platinum license, creates some ML jobs, then downgrades to a gold license would be very frustrated if they then couldn't delete the jobs.  So APIs like delete ML job are available and perform the expected action with a gold license.  The feature table simplifies this down to \"ML is platinum\" because, for example, the delete ML job is pretty useless if you cannot create a job in the first place, and from a high level perspective it would be extremely misleading to say \"some ML features are gold\".  But in the low level details it makes sense for the info/maintenance/cleanup bits of ML to work with gold.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/564483579","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50056#issuecomment-564483579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50056","id":564483579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDQ4MzU3OQ==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T10:42:27Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T10:42:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note that #46431 adjusts the logger for this message to `org.elasticsearch.xpack.ml.action.TransportGetDatafeedsStatsAction`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/564485137","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50056#issuecomment-564485137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50056","id":564485137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDQ4NTEzNw==","user":{"login":"dimitris-athanasiou","id":9351617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTE2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9351617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitris-athanasiou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T10:46:52Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T10:46:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It does but only on `master`.
