Get a certain number of results. \nWhen doing the same keyword request, but applying an aggregation (see below) on a string field which is possibly long, i got less results, the ones with a long \"log_message.raw\" value are not being retrieved. \n\n``` bash\n\"aggs\": {\n    \"2\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"field\": \"log_message.raw\",\n        \"size\": 0,\n        \"order\": {\n          \"_count\": \"desc\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThought it was related to kibana, but requesting directly through CURL give me same results\n\nThanks !\n","closed_by":{"login":"arnaudbey","id":4488016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODgwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4488016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudbey","html_url":"https://github.com/arnaudbey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudbey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudbey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudbey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudbey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudbey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudbey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudbey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudbey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudbey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
