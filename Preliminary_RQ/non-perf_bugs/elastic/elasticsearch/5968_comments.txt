For now, if you have an ambiguous poly that crosses the pole you'll need to manually split it into 2 separate explicit polys and put inside a `MultiPolygon`  Depending on the complexity of the poly computing the pole intersections can be non-trivial.  The in-work patch will do this for you.\n\nA separate issue is related to the distance_error_pct parameter.  If not specified, larger filters will have reduced accuracy.
