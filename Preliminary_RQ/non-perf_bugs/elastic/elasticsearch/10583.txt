I have [a gist here that can be used to recreate what I am seeing](https://gist.github.com/nedcampion/0bbc30f2a999dc904ebf)\n\nI am testing against 1.5.1. In short I create an index with a `geo_shape` field with the maximum precision, I then index a document containing a polygon that describes the boundary of Mexico and I then query against that index using an envelope that describes a small area in the southern tip of Texas. The query returns the document containing Mexico which is a false positive match.\n\nI realize that [geo_shape does not provide 100% accuracy depending on how it is configured](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.3/mapping-geo-shape-type.html#_accuracy) but the region I am querying with seems many miles away from the Mexico border and the precision is set to 1m. Is this a bug or am I missing something.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
