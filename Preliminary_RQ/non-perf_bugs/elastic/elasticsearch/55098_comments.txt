You should be able to see what Elasticsearch is getting in [_cat/thread_pool](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cat-thread-pool.html) APIs or by cranking the logs up to trace, specifically `org.elasticsearch.task`. I'm sure there are logstash resources to look at that I don't know as well.\r\n\r\nAt this point this doesn't *look* like a bug in Elasticsearch so I'm going to close this. https://discuss.elastic.co is probably the right place to get help with something like this. Likely in the logstash section.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
