This is the correct configuration for some parts of our code base, but in the majority of our code base `ESIntegTestCase` subclasses are treated as unit tests and `ESRestTestCase` subclasses are the integration tests. It'd be more correct to default the integration test class to `ESRestTestCase` and override it to `ESIntegTestCase` in some subprojects like `server`.\r\n\r\nI'm not making a value judgement on whether `ESIntegTestCase` subclasses *should* be considered integration tests, unit tests, or internal cluster tests. This is more an observation about how the classes are set up now. If we decide to shift things around at a later time then we can update the check again.\r\n\r\nI think an optimal solution to this problem is one that entirely removes the `--skip-integ-tests-in-disguise` flag.","closed_by":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
