We don't support streaming so if the first query needs to retrieve 1M ids this won't scale. Assuming the first query works, sending a query with tons of ids won't work either.\r\nInstead I'd suggest you to modelize your data to cope with Elasticsearch nature. You can denormalize your data and index the attributes directly in the main index.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
