This is unusual as Ubuntu has defaulted to systemd since 16.04, but it seems to be the case currently on WSL (more details: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/8036).\r\n\r\nThis discrepancy confuses the Elasticsearch package [uninstall script](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/ad4e4fd9b88c7831752ff7a5038238c4d82d8072/distribution/packages/src/common/scripts/prerm#L48) and of course also forces you to configure Elasticsearch using SysV.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the WSL isn't a [supported platform](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix) for Elasticsearch atm, therefore there are no tests for this platform and as a result we can't really support it at the moment.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to mention that on Windows, there are a number of good alternatives:\r\n\r\n- Run Elasticsearch on Windows via the [zip package](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/zip-windows.html)\r\n- Use the Elasticsearch native [msi package](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/windows.html)\r\n- Run Elasticsearch on the Ubuntu 18.04 WSL via the [tar.gz](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/zip-targz.html#install-targz) package.\r\n- Run Elasticsearch using Docker.\r\n- Run Elasticsearch using the deb package inside a HyperV or VirtualBox vm installed with Ubuntu 18.04 (as opposed to WSL).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/452000733","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37138#issuecomment-452000733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37138","id":452000733,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjAwMDczMw==","user":{"login":"wolf99","id":281700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTcwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/281700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99","html_url":"https://github.com/wolf99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolf99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-07T16:50:03Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T16:50:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the info @dliappis \r\nI have uninstalled by manually following the steps from the script that pertained to my system from the `prerm` and `postrm` scripts from https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/distribution/packages/src/common/scripts\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I needed to manually remove the elasticsearch script from `/etc/init.d/` after the `sudo update-rc.d -f elasticsearch remove` command.\r\nThis solved my issue.\r\n\r\nI hadn't seen the Supported Systems page you mentioned before I installed, but if I had I would likely have assumed that Ubuntu compatibility meant WSL compatibility.
