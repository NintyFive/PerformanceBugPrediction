However that doesn't stop anyone from adding many nested json objects to a nested field inside a single document. \r\n\r\nI believe we should add at least a soft limit to the number of nested Lucene documents that we index per json document. This to avoid a node going OOM when a single document contains too many nested json objects a node can handle indexing. While indexing we check the number of nested docs and if they go beyond a threshold (maybe 10000?) then we should abort and fail with an error.\r\n\r\nRelates to #11511","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
