Getting ids from hits is too slow because the fetch phase takes too much time. \n\nIf I use the terms aggregation with average sub aggregation on those fields to sort, the performance is considerably improved. \n\nThe order of the buckets supports sub aggregations on numeric fields. \n\ne.g.\n\n```\n{\n    \"aggs\" : {\n        \"product\" : {\n            \"terms\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"productID\",\n                \"order\" : { \"avg_sales_count\" : \"desc\" }\n            },\n            \"aggs\" : {\n                \"avg_sales_count\" : { \"avg\" : { \"field\" : \"sales_count\" } }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow I need the same support for geo-point fields to sort buckets from near to far.\n\nThe min/max/avg distance for each bucket can be returned by a scripted_metric sub aggregation, but its results can't be used to sort buckets.\n","closed_by":{"login":"zaobao","id":3198918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3198918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaobao","html_url":"https://github.com/zaobao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaobao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaobao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaobao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaobao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaobao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaobao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaobao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaobao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaobao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
