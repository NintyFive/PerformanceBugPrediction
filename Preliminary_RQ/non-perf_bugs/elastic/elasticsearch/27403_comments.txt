You can obtain the license and the notice from the [repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/v2.4.6). For 5.0 and later this is fixed, the license and notice are distributed in the JARs. We are not making any releases from 2.4 so we are not going to fix this there. Given this, I am going to close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
