The default value is 1000.\r\n\r\nCurrently, documentation simply says `index.mapping.total_fields.limit` is the max number of fields in an index.  For end users who are looking at the mappings api output and doing a count for validation, they will notice that ES will return a limit exception before the perceived # of fields hit 1000.  \r\n\r\nThis is because `index.mapping.total_fields.limit` includes the count of [meta](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/mapping-fields.html) fields and most of these will not show up in the mappings api output.  It will be nice to clarify this in the documentation, similar to how we do clarify that index.mapping.depth.limit counts also the root level as 1 level.","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
