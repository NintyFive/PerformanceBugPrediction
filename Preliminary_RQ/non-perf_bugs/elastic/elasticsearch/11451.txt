So what happened now is that the indices are currently writing the data only to the newly added third node and the first 2 nodes are not have any shards located. \nI want the data/shards to be allocated to all the 3 nodes, is there any issue with the configs? Can you please assist. \n","closed_by":{"login":"markwalkom","id":3184718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODQ3MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3184718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom","html_url":"https://github.com/markwalkom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
