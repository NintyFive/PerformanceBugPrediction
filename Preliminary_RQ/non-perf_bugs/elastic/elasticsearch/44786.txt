These 3 nodes are picked via remote cluster state call, where in the cluster state, node's list is fixed in particular order, so all the source cluster nodes will always use same set of 3 remote nodes as gateway nodes and traffic to remote cluster will be always skewed to those 3 nodes. \r\n\r\nInstead if we randomize and pick 3 gateway nodes from remote cluster state, that would provide better distribution of cross cluster search across all gateway nodes in remote cluster.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ebadyano","id":26631211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjMxMjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26631211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano","html_url":"https://github.com/ebadyano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
