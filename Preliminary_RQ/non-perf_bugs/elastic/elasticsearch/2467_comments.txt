The issue with failing tests should be fixed in karmi/tire/#540. No Tire test should fail now.\n2. If you're repeatedly re-creating an index with different settings, it may take time until it's propagated in the cluster, causing \"random\" errors. \n\n@kimchy I tend to close this issue, since I cannot re-create it. Calling `_refresh` on the index should be enough for all test-related cases; see this [discussion](https://github.com/karmi/tire/issues/537#issuecomment-11157644) (karmi/tire#537).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
