When putting together the document query, I assume the `_user.metadata.tokenGroups` field looks similar and I don't believe there's a way to be able to compare this metadata to a field that uses SID format for representing permissions.\r\n\r\nIt looks like Elastic uses the **tokenGroups** user attribute to populate the \"ldap_groups\" and there is already [a method to convert the bytes to SID](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/627ef279fd29f8af63303bcaafd641aef0ffc586/x-pack/plugin/security/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/security/authc/ldap/ActiveDirectorySIDUtil.java#L31) in the Elastic code base. I could see it being a modified version of the **ActiveDirectoryGroupsResolver** or a modification to the **LdapMetaDataResolver**, but I'm interested if this seems like a worthwhile addition to make it easier to compare user access in SID form to index SID fields.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"BigPandaToo","id":35386883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mzg2ODgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/35386883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigPandaToo","html_url":"https://github.com/BigPandaToo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigPandaToo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigPandaToo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigPandaToo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigPandaToo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigPandaToo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigPandaToo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigPandaToo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigPandaToo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigPandaToo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
