Effectively if you use the java api you can't specify a string or bytes array or map anymore when building a search request, as you need a structured java object instead, which is now natively streamable for communication between the nodes. This is why we removed all of the set methods that accepted string, bytes array, maps etc. from `SearchSourceBuilder` and `SearchRequest`. Those ones could only work knowing that parsing is delayed to each data node, which is not the case anymore in the master branch (future 3.0 release). That said I am closing this as won't fix, as the set methods that accept maps have all been removed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
