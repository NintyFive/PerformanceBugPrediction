This kills performance and does not seem to add any value. We had a few test failures because of that too on 2.1, like http://build-us-00.elastic.co/job/es_core_21_metal/338/ It should be sufficient to sync the translog on each request.\n\nIf we want to remove this option we should also think about how to schedule the translog fsyncing. We probably want a lower limit to the interval and decide what that should be. Then we also need a way to handle settings in already created indices that are lower that the chosen lower limit and how to handle old templates that have that.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
