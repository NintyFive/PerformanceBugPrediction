There's something very wrong with the cluster if the master does not get around to lower priority tasks in a reasonably short amount of time, and the solution to that is definitely not to promote things to IMMEDIATE.\r\n\r\nNote that we split up the historically-expensive shard-started task into a cheap URGENT part and a more expensive NORMAL part in #44433, and batched the more expensive parts together to avoid duplicate work. If we are still seeing URGENT-level tasks running unduly slowly then I would like more details so we can continue in this direction.\r\n\r\nI am closing this as I think it is fixed in more recent versions; if you are still seeing issues with inappropriate priorities or slowly-running tasks in versions â‰¥7.4.0 then please get back in touch and we can reopen this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
