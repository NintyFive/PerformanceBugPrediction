This is a migration bug. In 5.0 and later the percolator rewrites the query upon indexing and when percolating expects that queries have been rewritten, so that we don't have to rewrite each time ES percolates. The assumption that a query has been rewritten isn't true when upgrading from 2.4.x and before. This should be fixed.\r\n\r\nWhat you can do as work around is to reindex the problematic queries, that should resolve this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/304289263","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24485#issuecomment-304289263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24485","id":304289263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDI4OTI2Mw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-26T13:58:37Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T13:58:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed by #24617","performed_via_github_app":null}]
