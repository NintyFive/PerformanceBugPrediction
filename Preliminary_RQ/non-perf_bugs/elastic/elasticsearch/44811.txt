However, we found that the slow logs output didn't include a username. Given that there may be non-developers that may be creating/viewing dashboards, they may not know what their raw query looks like. Therefore, with only the query to go off of, it's hard to track down exactly who ran the query. It would really useful to include the username of the user who ran the query in the slow log output\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hobo05","id":7526980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjY5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7526980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobo05","html_url":"https://github.com/hobo05","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobo05/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobo05/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobo05/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobo05/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobo05/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobo05/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobo05/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobo05/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hobo05/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
