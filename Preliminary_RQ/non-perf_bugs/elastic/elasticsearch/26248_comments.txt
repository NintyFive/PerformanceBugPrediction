make sure we are on the same page, we are requesting to have all the snapshot and restore settings that are currently only configurable by editing the elasticsearch.yml file, be configurable via the APIs, both REST (http) API and Transport (java) API, including `account`, `key`, etc. :\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/repository-azure-usage.html\r\n\r\nThe reason for that is that in some systems (e.g. DC/OS using the mesosphere elastic package) we don't have access to set or modify settings on the elasticsearch.yml file, node system variables, node enviremenmt vatriables, or even add/adjust the parameters that elasticsearch is run with.\r\nThis is why we need the ability to specify all settings like Azure accout, key, etc, when we reference/create a

function.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/376186458","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26248#issuecomment-376186458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26248","id":376186458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjE4NjQ1OA==","user":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T14:31:29Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T14:31:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In the recent versions of Elasticsearch, we don't allow any secret to be specified using the REST API, Java API or directly in the elasticsearch configuration file. Instead, any secret must be defined in the Elasticsearch Keystore (see [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/secure-settings.html#creating-keystore)) as a secured setting. \r\n\r\nFor now these settings are not reloadable but there is an ongoing effort (#29135) to make them reloadable. This way, the Azure/S3/GCS settings will be updatable in the keystore specified at the elasticsearch startup.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to close this issue as we won't allow to specify credentials using the Rest API in the future.
