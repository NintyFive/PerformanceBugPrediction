Actual behaviour is that JSON string types can be returned. \n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. create an index with an integer mapping:\n   \n   curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/shmap/' -d '{\n       \"settings\" : {\n           \"number_of_shards\" : 1,\n           \"number_of_replicas\" : 0\n       },\n       \"mappings\" : {\n           \"type\" : {\n               \"dynamic\" : false,\n               \"properties\" : {\n                   \"shint\" : { \n                       \"type\" : \"integer\", \n                   }\n               }\n           }\n       }\n   }'\n2. insert a string that is made of integers:\n   \n   curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/shmap/type' -d '{\n       \"shint\" : \"00000001\"  \n   }'\n3. Get it back. Note that the string is still a string, even though the type is integer:\n   \n   {\"took\":1,\"timed_out\":false,\"_shards\":{\"total\":1,\"successful\":1,\"failed\":0},\"hits\":{\"total\":1,\"max_score\":1.0,\"hits\":[{\"_index\":\"shmap\",\"_type\":\"type\",\"_id\":\"AVfgtbAbNiGlzqOiG3dD\",\"_score\":1.0,\"_source\":{\n       \"shint\" : \"00000001\"  \n   }}]}}\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
