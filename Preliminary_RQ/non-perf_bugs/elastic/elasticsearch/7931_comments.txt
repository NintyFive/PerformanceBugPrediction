There are two \"distributors\" which decide which data path to use next: `least_used` (the default) and `random`.\n\nCould you possibly try setting `index.store.distributor` to `random` and see if the behaviour changes?  Or leave it as `least_used` but then make sure that all 3 disks have similar amounts of free space?\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/59523869","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7931#issuecomment-59523869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7931","id":59523869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTIzODY5","user":{"login":"olehrgf","id":1470963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzA5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1470963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olehrgf","html_url":"https://github.com/olehrgf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olehrgf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olehrgf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olehrgf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olehrgf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olehrgf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olehrgf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olehrgf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olehrgf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olehrgf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-17T14:49:27Z","updated_at":"2014-10-17T14:49:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry, but I cannot check changes with this setting (index.store.distributor=random). \nAs to free space...
