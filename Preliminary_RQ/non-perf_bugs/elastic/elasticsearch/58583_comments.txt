Especially when getting started with data streams (and Elasticsearch). Also making timestamp field mapping optional, also improves the getting started experience.\r\n\r\nFurther more it should still be allowed to define the mapping for timestamp field in a component's or composable index's template section. This makes sense if all the other mappings are also defined in the template and otherwise mappings would need to be specified in two places.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
