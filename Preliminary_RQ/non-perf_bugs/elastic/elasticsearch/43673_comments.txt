like this failure is caused by the fact that the thread that executes this test suite is interrupted. The `Matcher#searchInterruptible(...)` returns `-2` in `toRegex(...)` method and we happily execute the if statement after that, which causes the exception. I think we should only execute that if statement if `result` variable is 0 or higher. \r\n\r\nI found this, because I opened #48284, that adds more info to an exception message. \r\n\r\nI think that this failure happens, because the test framework is reusing threads and perhaps the interrupted status isn't reset, which causes this test to fail (joni checks whether a thread is interrupted and then stops searching for matches). I think we need to check the current thread's interrupted status before executing these tests and unset the interrupted status.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/562518156","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43673#issuecomment-562518156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43673","id":562518156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjUxODE1Ng==","user":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T10:24:00Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T10:24:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This
