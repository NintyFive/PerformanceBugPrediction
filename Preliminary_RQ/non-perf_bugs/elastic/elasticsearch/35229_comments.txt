I wonder if this is triggered by a retry from the GCS client.\r\n- The second exception `IOException[Error writing request body to server]` is also mentioned here: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/issues/3410 and it looks like the Google clients team have worked on a fix for that here: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/pull/3433.
