This is part of our Gradle resolution works, first looking for metadata in an associated `.xml` file. In this case, it's not the non-existence of that file that caused the failure, but rather a network error occurred that cause the read to timeout rather than return with a 404 which would have led Gradle to continue attempting to download the `.tar.gz`. We do rebuild our CI images periodically to automatically include these build-time dependencies in our CI images, to reduce the chance that we encounter network errors during the build.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
