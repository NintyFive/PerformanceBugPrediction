However this will produce a reverse order on the term names. For \"reverse_count\", this is the opposite.\n\nso I end up with z:1, a:1, rather than a:1,z:1 which, to my expectation, more people would be able to use to find the matching entries.\n\nAdditionally, the comparison is always case sensitive and cannot be changed.\n\nSo in the end, It looks like I always will need to resort the entries myself. But this creates wasted effort. Right now, it is not possible to get the facets without any sorting.\nElasticsearch will always sort the Facets, and then I will have to sort them again.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
