More like this allows to find documents that \"look\" like the provided text when matches against one or more field.\n\nThe moreLikeThis query looks as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    moreLikeThis : {\n        fields : [\"name.first\", \"name.last\"],\n        likeText : \"something\",\n        minTermFrequency : 1,\n        maxQueryTerms : 12\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe moreLikeThisField looks as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    moreLikeThisField : {\n        \"name.first\" : {\n            likeText : \"something\",\n            minTermFrequency : 1,\n            maxQueryTerms : 12\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThere are much more parameters that are supported, will be documented in the ref docs for the next release. They basically follow the MLT support in Lucene.\n\nThe difference between moreLikeThisField and moreLikeThis is that in moreLikeThisField only a single field can be provided, and it will supported \"typed\" fields (will automatically filter based on the type).\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
