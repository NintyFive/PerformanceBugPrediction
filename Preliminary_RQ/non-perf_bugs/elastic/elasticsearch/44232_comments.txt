The docs are explicitly wrong which is why I reported it here rather than asked in the forum. I can see the following issues with the docs:\r\n* They explicitly state an invalid value as an example\r\n* No reference to the deprecation/change on that docs page or the provided painless contexts page\r\n* It's not even slightly clear from the new \"painless contexts\" page what they're on about. Which one(s) is/are required for a basic \"search\"? Do you expect users to test every possible combination? I'd suggest it's a bad idea to require users to have a deep understanding of how ES processes queries if they want to set up decent security - the more bars there are for security, the less likely people will engage with it.\r\n* There's no link to the \"painless contexts\" from the security page.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/520079967","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44232#issuecomment-520079967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44232","id":520079967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDA3OTk2Nw==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-09T22:09:42Z","updated_at":"2019-08-09T22:09:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mohmad-null Apologies, I see your point now.
