Clocks, even with NTP, diverge. Updates can happen which depend on the current state of the document, those could well be wrong. There are so many potential issues with this setup that we could never make it work correctly in all cases.\n\nWe never do shard level merging. Whichever shard is chosen as primary wins. Even if we had atomic clocks, going through two shard copies and deciding which documents to use is just too expensive.\n\nThe advice is clear: to avoid a split-brain you need to set `minimum_master_nodes` to a quorum of the master-eligible nodes in the cluster.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
