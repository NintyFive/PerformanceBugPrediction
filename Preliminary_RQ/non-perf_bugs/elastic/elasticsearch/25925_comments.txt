We will need to do some debugging to see what the source of the problems. I would suggest you open an forum topic on discuss.elastic.co and we can pick it up there. If it turns out to be a bug in ES we can open an issue with the relevant details.\r\n\r\nPS. When you post information to the forum, can you please add trace logging to `org.elasticsearch.discovery.zen.PublishClusterStateAction`? it will help figuring out what goes on.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
