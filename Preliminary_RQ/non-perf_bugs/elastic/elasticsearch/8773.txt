For my requirements, I need to read the information inside `filter` object of the search command. I use that information to decide \"what to highlight\". I start with `highlighterContext.context.parsedPostFilter().filter()` and try to recursively traverse clauses of `bool` filters. Now, `term` filters and cached `fquery` filters are both wrapped inside the class `WeightedFilterCache.FilterCacheFilterWrapper`. This class has package private visibility. Even its field `filter` is not exposed. As a result I am not able to traverse through the entire filter structure. Unless there is a very good reason to keep this class package private, I would propose to make the class `WeightedFilterCache.FilterCacheFilterWrapper` public and expose its field `filter` with a public `getter` method like `getFilter()` as done by other classes extending from class `Filter`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
