So after execution elasticsearch created only one task without children.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1. Create index src_index, dst_index. Put some data to src_index.\r\n 2. Call reindex method like\r\nelasticClient.reindex(\r\n        ReindexRequest()\r\n            .setSourceIndices(\"src_index\")\r\n            .setDestIndex(\"dst_index\")\r\n            .setSlices(3),\r\n        RequestOptions.DEFAULT\r\n)\r\n 3. Check that elasticsearch created only one task instead of 4(one parent and three child)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hub-cap","id":613352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzM1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/613352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap","html_url":"https://github.com/hub-cap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
