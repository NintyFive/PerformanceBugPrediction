The trouble is that being able to pick up the directory later one is much more complex then we'd like and we won't be able to test it properly.\r\n\r\nThe things that worry me about this are:\r\n1. To setup the jvm security on bootstrap we need to call [toRealPath](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Path.html#toRealPath-java.nio.file.LinkOption...-) on the thing to resolve symlinks. Mounting a new path is very likely to make this incorrect. We can't delay this because the transition into the java sandbox is one way.\r\n2. The extra complexity around rejecting snapshots until the directory is \"ready\" isn't a thing we'd like to maintain either.\r\n3. We're quite unlikely to test this well because we'd have to emulate things mounting which we don't have good infrastructure for.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
