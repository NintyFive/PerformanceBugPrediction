Even though their json is the same, they get parsed differently as you noticed, and there is quite some difference between a query and a filter in the way it gets executed in lucene.\n\nOn the other hand I can't reproduce the problem you described using the term query. The query doesn't get properly parsed when providing an array but I don't get back any error. What version of elasticsearch are you using?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/22503670","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3455#issuecomment-22503670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3455","id":22503670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTAzNjcw","user":{"login":"bclozel","id":103264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzI2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/103264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bclozel","html_url":"https://github.com/bclozel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bclozel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bclozel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bclozel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bclozel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bclozel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bclozel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bclozel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bclozel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bclozel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-12T15:56:37Z","updated_at":"2013-08-12T15:56:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm using v0.90.2.\nI can't reproduce this issue; both \"term\" and \"terms\" are working on a facet_filter.
