It would be nice to be able to just specify an `expression` instead and also accept hard-coded values (as done today).\n\nIf a weight of a suggestion is calculated by a combination of field values (`popularity`, `recency` for example), then the following format can be used:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -X PUT 'localhost:9200/music/song/1?refresh=true' -d '{\n    \"name\": ...,\n    \"suggest\": {\n        \"input\": [\n           ...\n        ],\n        \"output\": ...,\n        \"payload\": {\n            ...\n        },\n        \"weight\": \"doc['popularity'].value * 0.8 + doc['recency'].value * 0.2\"\n    }\n}'\n```\n\nthe example above assumes `popularity` and `recency` to be already defined in the mapping and both have `Numeric` values.\n\nrelated #6818\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
