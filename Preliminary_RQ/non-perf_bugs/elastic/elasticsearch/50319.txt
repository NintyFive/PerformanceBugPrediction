data that is not suitable for categorization is categorized then it is possible for an excessive number of categories to be created, each with a very small number of messages.\r\n\r\nThe resultant categories are not very useful, and also resource hungry, both in terms of results documents to process and because they increase the cardinality of the chained anomaly detection.\r\n\r\nTo make it clearer that such a situation has occurred and to encourage the user to stop the affected job we should write an audit message when there are lots of categories for a job.\r\n\r\nThe condition for doing this could be as simple as \"number of categories > 1000\".\r\n\r\nOr we could go for something more advanced like \"number of input documents > 1000 and number of categories > number of input documents / 10\" or \"number of categories > 3 * âˆšnumber of input
