Otherwise, files that I checked in would be completely reformatted on the next time that an intellij user would modify it, which makes reviews painful.\n\nI am +1 on changing it to disallow wildcards. Although not a requirement, it would be nice to do it on the intellij config too to avoid the back and forth in the way that imports are organized.\n\nRegarding auto-organize, I added it because Eclipse would otherwise fail at inserting imports at the right position but we can disable it if it is inconvenient to you.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/54446995","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7587#issuecomment-54446995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7587","id":54446995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDQ2OTk1","user":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-04T10:17:52Z","updated_at":"2014-09-04T10:17:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the auto-organize is the bigger evil. It seems like bugs in eclipse, i'm not sure. But i always have this problem when code refactoring if the file has some style issues, e.g. even if its 'add missing `@Override`', and have to come back and correct it. Usually its ok when manually refactoring, because I'm specifically looking out for it. Maybe eclipse 4.x doesnt have the issue... I know I'm still stuck on 3.x because i need the speed...\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/54590714","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7587#issuecomment-54590714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7587","id":54590714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTkwNzE0","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-05T06:46:09Z","updated_at":"2014-09-05T06:46:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 on removing wildcard imports for both eclipse and intellij.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
