I hesitated as DECAY_FUNCTION is not a normal lower case command but forged on anyway because all the \"examples\" used it. I feel dumb now.\n\nThe docs should be changed to make examples real examples, and also I've noticed the tendency of an \"example\" to be used out of the context of the container it should be in. Preferably at least once in each page for a command there should be a full working example pasted in? that includes any outer levels, even if it is just a match_all ?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
