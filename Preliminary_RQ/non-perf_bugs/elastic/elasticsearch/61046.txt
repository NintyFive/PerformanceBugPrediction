The first iteration of the API will operate on a single alias with the following provisions:\r\n\r\n- The name of the alias will be used as the name of the new data stream. As part of the migration, the alias will be removed.\r\n- The alias should be \"clean\" with no filter or routing specifications.\r\n- All indices referenced by the alias will be set to hidden.\r\n- The alias must have a write index.\r\n- The _data_stream_timestamp field mapper will be inserted into the indices to enable validation.\r\n- The mappings of the indices with _data_stream_timestamp meta field mapper will be validated.\r\n- A composable index template must exist for the new data stream.
