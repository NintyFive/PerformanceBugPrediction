It's not clear what is happening. I noticed from the stack dump in the logs that the test is blocked on an indexing request that apparently never finished. There are two conflicting forces here:\r\n - the test is using NIO transport\r\n - the test is on macOS\r\n\r\nThese are conflicting forces because NIO transport is still in active development, and we have had a lot of issues with *standalone* nodes stalling on macOS the last few weeks (I am not sure why). They are both potential sources to look at, I don't know which it could be. I lean towards thinking this should be looked at from an NIO transport perspective first.\r\n\r\n@tbrooks8 Can you take a look at this one? If you do not find anything, please close.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/357355899","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26445#issuecomment-357355899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26445","id":357355899,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzM1NTg5OQ==","user":{"login":"tbrooks8","id":862472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjQ3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/862472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrooks8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-12T21:15:06Z","updated_at":"2018-01-12T21:15:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have looked at this a couple of times and have been unable to reproduce it.
