For example in the case of weekly indices all the indices of the last month. This can be achieved via aliases, however this does require that something is updating the aliases each time new indices get introduced. Also when the search request (or part of the search request) is stored elsewhere already updating the search request and the alias itself isn't straight forward, because now the search request needs to be maintained in two places.\n\nInstead it would be better if date math is supported in the index names option for all index based apis (search, index, percolate etc.). By adding support for the following format in index names: \n\n```\n<static_name{date_math_expr{optional_date_format}}>\n```\n\nThe following index names can be specified:\n- `<logstash-{now/d}>` translates into `logstash-2024.03.22`\n- `<logstash-{now/M}>` translates into `logstash-2024.03.01`\n- `<logstash-{now/M{YYYY.MM}}>` translates into `logstash-2024.03`\n- `<logstash-{now/M-1M{YYYY.MM}}>` translates into `logstash-2024.02`\n\nThe data math expressions should be resolved before wildcard expressions are resolved during the concrete index name resolution.\n\nBefore this feature can be added the code that currently exists for index name wildcard expansions, index to concrete index resolutions should be refactored first to support this nicely without hacks.
