On the queries I've looked at, the `took` time while the `time` on Lucene subqueries are much higher than \"reasonable.\" For example, the original (much more verbose) query I was profiling  `took` about 2 minutes to complete (which was matched by the `curl` output) while one of the `BooleanQuery` `time`s  said it took ~25 minutes (it did not).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nI am able to consistently reproduce the problem on our production cluster:\r\n\r\n* Query: https://gist.github.com/maxshortzp/d27fb0f4b66ea06dc7185089be16c13d\r\n* Profile result: https://gist.github.com/maxshortzp/46e94e9dd75510a21535c2f02586f2f0\r\n* Relevant portion of mapping `\"person_location_country\":{\"type\":\"keyword\"}`\r\n\r\nSo far, I haven't been able to reproduce the problem in a standalone Vagrant virtual machine. Any pointers for making that happen are appreciated. If I figure it out, I'll update this bug.\r\n\r\nAlso happy to provide additional information if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\nCan't think of any relevant logs but happy to provide if necessary.","closed_by":{"login":"maxshortzp","id":31416805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDE2ODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/31416805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxshortzp","html_url":"https://github.com/maxshortzp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxshortzp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxshortzp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxshortzp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxshortzp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxshortzp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxshortzp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxshortzp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxshortzp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxshortzp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
