I discussed this with @martijnvg in another channel and he will proceed with the implementation.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm unsure of is this should be a *move* to a byte-sized based limit as opposed to having the possibility of either (and enforcing both).

I think it's the main motivation to limit it. I struggle to find a good default for the count based one, but it's easy to have sane default (1GB or 512MB) for the bytes.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
