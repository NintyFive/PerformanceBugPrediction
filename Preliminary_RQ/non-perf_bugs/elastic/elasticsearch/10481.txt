B is a child to A. The filter extracts from the index all the types applying some conditions. B gets soft deleted (marked as deleted in the document with a flag) and does not show in the documents returned when searching the alias. But when I query for A that do not have B (using a has_child filter), all A are returned regardless if they any children in the alias (they still have children in the index).\n\nThis is a workaround for this issue https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10135. I removed the has_child filter for the alias (see person in the issue ) tried to filter on search time with this simple filter:\n\n```\n{\"filter\":{\"has_child\":{\"type\":\"message\",\"filter\":{\"match_all\":{}},\"min_children\":1}}}\n```\n\nAlso I think that the children aggregation is affected in this scenario as any aggregation on A will take into consideration the deleted B.\n\nIs this a bug?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
