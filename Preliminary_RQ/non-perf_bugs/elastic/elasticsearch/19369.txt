If I use the following build script, it works so far:\n\n```\n   buildscript {\n       repositories {\n           mavenCentral()\n           maven {\n               name 'sonatype-snapshots'\n               url \"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/\"\n        }\n        jcenter()\n    }\n    dependencies {\n          classpath \"org.elasticsearch.gradle:build-tools:5.0.0-alpha5-SNAPSHOT\" \n    }\n}\napply plugin: 'java'\napply plugin: 'idea'\napply plugin: 'eclipse'\napply plugin: 'elasticsearch.esplugin'\n```\n1. If instead I manually download the .jar file https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/elasticsearch/gradle/build-tools/5.0.0-alpha5-SNAPSHOT/build-tools-5.0.0-20160613.145150-483 and use the file dependencies as follows, it does not work any more (see error log below):\n\n```\n   buildscript {\n    repositories {\n        mavenCentral()\n        maven {\n            name 'sonatype-snapshots'\n            url \"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/\"\n        }\n        jcenter()\n    }\n    dependencies {\n          classpath files(\"/home/anhxa/tmpdir/build-tools-5.0.0-20160613.145150-483.jar\") \n    }\n}\n```\n1. What am I missing here? What do I have to do in order to make the file dependency described in step 2 work properly? Many thanks for your help!\n\n```\n**Error logs**: * What went wrong:\nA problem occurred evaluating root project 'example-plugin'.\n\\> Failed to apply plugin [id 'carrotsearch.randomized-testing']\n   \\> Could not create task of type 'RandomizedTestingTask'.\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
