But the behaviour here is rounding even when given a date/time without the date maths syntax.\r\n\r\nThis caused us problems because when using java.time for creating these queries the default ISO_INSTANT formatter is specified as \"The nano-of-second outputs zero, three, six or nine digits as necessary.\", thus not providing milliseconds when these happen to be 0.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to use a different formatter which always outputs the milliseconds, or explicitly using date maths without any actual maths/rounding (by appending \"||\").\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -s -XDELETE localhost:9200/date-test?pretty\r\n\r\n# create index with date field mapping\r\ncurl -s -XPUT localhost:9200/date-test?pretty -H'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"properties\": {\r\n      \"datetime\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"date\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}'\r\n\r\n# index 2 documents\r\ncurl -s -XPOST localhost:9200/date-test/_doc/?pretty\\&refresh=true -H'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\r\n{\r\n  \"datetime\": \"2020-01-01T12:00:00.500Z\"\r\n}'\r\n\r\ncurl -s -XPOST localhost:9200/date-test/_doc/?pretty\\&refresh=true -H'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\r\n{\r\n  \"datetime\": \"2020-01-01T12:00:01.500Z\"\r\n}'\r\n\r\n# search with a date range\r\ncurl -s localhost:9200/date-test/_search?pretty -H'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"range\": {\r\n      \"datetime\": {\r\n        \"gt\": \"2020-01-01T12:00:00Z\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}'\r\n```\r\nExpected result: both documents should be returned.\r\nActual result: only the second document is returned.\r\n\r\nChanging the query to `\"gt\": \"2020-01-01T12:00:00.000Z\"` does behave as expected, returning both documents.\r\n\r\nChanging the query to `\"gt\": \"2020-01-01T12:00:00Z||\"` also returns both documents.\r\n\r\nChanging the query to `\"gt\": \"2020-01-01T12:00:00.000Z||/s\"`, explicitly enabling rounding only returns the second document as expected.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\nNot relevant\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pgomulka","id":11137008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTM3MDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11137008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka","html_url":"https://github.com/pgomulka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
