Ideally by keeping the system and hidden indices out of the cat APIs, we can keep the APIs simpler. Additionally, we would like some additional freedom in the cat API output such that we could add a new column (may be in the middle of existing columns), which may more easily be handled by the human eye than an application (depending on how its parsing is implemented). If we have applications depending on the cat API and we don't expect them to be depending on the cat API, a change we make could break the application which is something we would like to avoid.\r\n\r\n@jasontedor may have other points and be able to articulate the reasoning better than I can.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/584396068","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51772#issuecomment-584396068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51772","id":584396068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDM5NjA2OA==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-10T22:48:15Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T22:48:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think our [docs] allude to the reason that @jaymode expands on well:\r\n\r\n>JSON is great…​ for computers.
