This new highlighter has been added in 5.4 so a workaround is to switch to this new highlighter. That's the default in 6 so it's a good idea to use this new highlighter in 5.x in order to prepare for the upgrade to 6. Regarding the bug in the `plain` highlighter I'll check why the two fragments are merged but the long term solution is to switch to the new highlighter.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/375379320","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27638#issuecomment-375379320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27638","id":375379320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTM3OTMyMA==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-22T16:55:58Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T16:55:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is fixed in 6.0 with the `unified` highlighter, hence closing.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
