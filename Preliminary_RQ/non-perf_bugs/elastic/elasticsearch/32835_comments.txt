The relevant part of the documentation is here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.x/sql-data-types.html#sql-multi-field\r\n\r\n> As SQL requires exact values, when encountering a text field Elasticsearch SQL will search for an exact multi-field that it can use for comparisons, sorting and aggregations. To do that, it will search for the first keyword that it can find that is not normalized and use that as the original field exact value.\r\n\r\nWhile it may seem normal to have normalized values in Elasticsearch and to be able to search using the same normalizer at search time, in SQL world the searched value should stay as is (no changes behind the scene, like it happens in Elasticsearch where the normalizer is applied at search time as well). If you perform the same test, but with field `art_id` (which has a `keyword` but doesn't have a `normalizer`), everything should work.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
