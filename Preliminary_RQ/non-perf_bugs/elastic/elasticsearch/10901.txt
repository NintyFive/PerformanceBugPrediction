For an example if you want to find the most frequently used radio frequency, just on FM range there is a more then 10 stations between 99 to 100 if you multiply it by 10.\n\nI can resolve this problem by pre-indexing all my field with fixed factor, but its opposes a problem what if my client will want to change the factor dynamically?\n\nAnd that why I came to the conclusion that we have to have a factor field (like in date histogram) or maybe to enable the  interval to be float number (both can be great)\n\nthank you very much,\nregards Raz Abadi \n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
