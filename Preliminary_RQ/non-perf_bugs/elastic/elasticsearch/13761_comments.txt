I remember some people arguing that `not` was important for the query DSL so that you could do things like:\n\n``` java\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"query\": /* some_query */\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"not\": { /* some filter */ }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever in the meantime we deprecated the `filtered`, `and` and `or` queries and `bool` is now the only way to combine several filters together, so all uses of the `not` filter can be replaced with a `must_not` clause (which will also execute faster). For instance the above query becomes:\n\n``` java\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"must\": /* some_query */\n      \"must_not\": { /* some filter */ }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/143698628","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13761#issuecomment-143698628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13761","id":143698628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzY5ODYyOA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-28T10:02:08Z","updated_at":"2015-09-28T10:02:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm good with that\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/149499287","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13761#issuecomment-149499287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13761","id":149499287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTQ5OTI4Nw==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-20T09:51:30Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T09:51:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So are we good with deprecating the complete `not` query from 2.x on and delete in 3.0 like with `and` and `or`?
