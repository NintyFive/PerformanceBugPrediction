We retrieve values like biggest month, smallest month, busiest month, slowest month, etc, and I was hoping to at least be able to do something like below, but there is no \"size\" field on the histograms, so even though the results are ordered the way I want, I have to get back thousands of results just so I can print a single number on a website.\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"query\": {

them) work on multi value aggregations as a filter (which is currently not being used for anything), so something like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"query\": { \"match_all\": {} },\n    \"aggs\": {\n        \"biggest_month\": {\n            \"max\": { \"field\": \"by_month.sum_of_po_totals\" }\n        },\n        \"smallest_month\": {\n            \"min\": { \"field\": \"by_month.sum_of_po_totals\" }\n        },\n        \"busiest_month\": {\n            \"max\": { \"field\": \"by_month.count_of_pos\" }\n        },\n        \"slowest_month\": {\n            \"min\": { \"field\": \"by_month.count_of_pos\" }\n        },\n        \"aggs\": {\n            \"by_month\": {\n                \"date_histogram\": {\n                    \"field\": \"PO.IssuedDate\",\n                    \"interval\": \"month\",\n                    \"format\": \"yyyy-MM\"\n                },\n                \"aggs\": {\n                    \"sum_of_po_totals\": {\n                        \"sum\": { \"field\": \"PO.IssuedAmount\" }\n                    },\n                    \"count_of_pos\": {\n                        \"value_count\": { \"field\": \"PO.ID\" }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"size\": 0\n}\n```\n\nOf course, the \"having\" modifier mentioned originally would also be fantastic for doing range queries, etc on these aggregate results as well, and would also solve our issue if we could use a \"max\" aggregate in a \"having\" clause (even though I personally find it a little less intuitive to have it at the bottom of the hierarchy, but I'm guessing it would probably be easier to implement that way since it is still a single valued aggregate operating under a multi-valued bucket aggregate).\n\nNo matter what the solution, this is still a pretty massive hole for our needs in an otherwise awesome aggregations framework, which is unfortunate.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/34967951","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4404#issuecomment-34967951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4404","id":34967951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTY3OTUx","user":{"login":"SeyZ","id":519129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTEyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/519129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeyZ","html_url":"https://github.com/SeyZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeyZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeyZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeyZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeyZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeyZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeyZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeyZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeyZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeyZ/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-13T10:57:30Z","updated_at":"2014-02-13T10:57:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If
