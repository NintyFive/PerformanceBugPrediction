The older method, which is used in cluster state serialization is using [registered `PROTO` objects](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/a9a2753f0b07ee644e1babfd9de4f00df17e7b2a/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/ClusterState.java#L105) to select the proper de-serialization reader. In all other places we switched to using `NamedWriteable`s for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nI would like to convert custom objects in `ClusterState`, `MetaData` and `IndexMetaData` to `NamedWritable`s and see if I can completely remove `PROTO`-based serialization to make cluster state serialization/deserialization more in line with the rest of the system. It's a significant change internally and will affect plugins that are registering custom metadata objects, but it looks like wire-protocol would remain the same and therefore it should be possible to make this change compatible with rolling restart.","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
