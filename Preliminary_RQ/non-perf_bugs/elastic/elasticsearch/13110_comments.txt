That way you can restore your index and update the alias to point to both indices (and not have to change your application).  Of course, that is only one thing you may want to do.  You may also want to update the alias to point to just the restored index.\n\nAs soon as there are a number of paths to choose (different people will want to do different things at different times) then the number of options you have to add to support these use cases multiplies and becomes confusing.  \n\nWe have APIs to manage aliases which already provide the tools to support all the use cases.  It is pretty easy to write a script to suit your exact use case, certainly easier than trying to add a range of parameters to the snapshot/restore API.\n\nFor this reason I'm -1 on adding this.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/135717684","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13110#issuecomment-135717684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13110","id":135717684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTcxNzY4NA==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-28T09:39:23Z","updated_at":"2015-08-28T09:39:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi,\n\nWe discussed this today during our fixit friday meetup and this is something we won't support in elasticsearch itself.\nYou should always check if your index have been restored correctly before switching an alias.\n\nIf you are using curator, may be this is a feature which can be supported there?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
