Ideally the suggesters should never suggest from deleted documents.\n\nThe solution is to encode lucene docids in the generated FST used by suggesters, and filter out suggestions from deleted documents at query time. This approach would also allow us to make use of the lucene docids to make the suggesters more flexible in terms of returning fields not specified at 'index' time in the future. This approach also implies changing how the FSTs are built currently (i.e. dedup-ing same surface forms might not make sense anymore, as each entry will be tied to a lucene doc).\n\n**NOTE:** this is an issue for `feature/nrt_suggester`\n","closed_by":{"login":"areek","id":753679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/753679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek","html_url":"https://github.com/areek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
