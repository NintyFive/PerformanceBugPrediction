Since the range of possible values is fixed, I'm thinking that a fixed-size encoding that would map [-180,180] into [0, 2^<sup>bits_per_value</sup>] would be rather efficient. For example, if my math is correct, a `bits_per_value` of 24 (62.5% reduction) could give a precision of ~5m, a `bits_per_value` of 32 (50% reduction) would give a precision of ~20mm, and a `bits_per_value` of 40 (37.5% reduction) would give a precision << 1mm.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
