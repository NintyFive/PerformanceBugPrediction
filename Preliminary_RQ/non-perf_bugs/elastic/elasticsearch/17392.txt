This used to work up until very recently, because Kibana sends `unmapped_type: boolean` by default with searches from the Discover tab. I'm wondering if this was a regression or an intentional change, because I can't find any mention of it in any GH issue or PR. `unmapped_type` does still work for regular fields, so I'm not sure if this is just _score, or any meta field.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. POST a search with the following body `{\"sort\":[{\"_score\":{\"order\":\"desc\",\"unmapped_type\":\"boolean\"}}]}`\n2. Observe the 400 error\n\nKibana issue I created for more info about how we use unmapped_type: https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/6698\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
