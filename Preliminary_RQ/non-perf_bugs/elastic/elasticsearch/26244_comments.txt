For instance doc values need some per-field metadata in memory (such as the `Lucene410DocValuesProducer$NumericEntry` class that you saw), postings and doc values need to maintain open index inputs, we need to load the terms dictionary for term-based fields and the BKD tree index for point-based fields, etc.\r\n\r\nPlus there is also information that we need to maintain at the Elasticsearch level because of mappings.\r\n\r\nThe resource usage that you are seeing is a function of `${num_fields} x ${num_segments}`. You should look into reducing either or both of them, eg. by having fewer shards, force-merging read-only indices if any or modeling documents differently in a way that there are fewer fields at the Lucene level.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
