An audit message is created if 1000 or more categories exact for a job before 100 buckets of results have been created.\r\n\r\nFor 7.7 the intention is to add extra fields into the `model_size_stats` that can be used to determine whether categorization is doing a good job.  One field will be a high level `categorization_status` enum with values `ok` and `warn` (similar to how we have `memory_status` for model memory).  Other fields will report the numbers that underlie that overall status, such as `categorized_doc_count`, `total_category_count`, `frequent_category_count`, `rare_category_count` and `dead_category_count`.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
