The multi-fields approach is more flexible because you can boost each form (stemmed, phonetic, ...) differently. Are you concerned about performance when using the multi fields approach ? Since terms are different, the cost should be the same if you index the phonetic and the original form in two fields.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/339996169","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26486#issuecomment-339996169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26486","id":339996169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTk5NjE2OQ==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-27T14:59:34Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T14:59:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fbaligand  you can comment directly on the Lucene jira that you opened so I hope you don't mind if I close this issue.
