Since `prune` is enabled, the options from all shards are returned, even if failing the collate query. \r\n\r\nWhen suggester options are merged at the end of a query, only the scores of the options are considered. The `collate_match` field values are ignored. This means that the suggester only reports that the `collate_match` is true for options returned from the first suggester result seen. This is mostly a problem in cases where suggested phrase is one that results in a rare hit.\r\n\r\nIt is only possible to see these false negatives in the result list when `prune` is enabled. Without `prune` enabled, the suggester will return the correct results, as the only suggestion options that are returned are those that pass the collate query.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/suggest/Suggest.java#L744","closed_by":{"login":"jbaiera","id":875779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/875779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera","html_url":"https://github.com/jbaiera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
