They are destructive to the system they run on and only work on certain operating systems. It doesn't make sense to test the RPM build on Debian, nor does it make sense to test the DEB build on CentOS.\n\nI propose we automate some testing of these using vagrant or a similar technology. Vagrant sounds like a good place to start at least.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
