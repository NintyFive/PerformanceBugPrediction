But those things which were in /var/lib/elasticsearch were there by default, so it seems unconsistent, to install package by one operation and to uninstall you need beside uninstall operation also remove files which were not created by me, but by package, manually. I know that this is probably because it wants to be safe, but maybe if it would have some index of default files/folders to check. Thanks anyway for your response\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/106198880","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11373#issuecomment-106198880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11373","id":106198880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjE5ODg4MA==","user":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-28T06:51:26Z","updated_at":"2015-05-28T06:51:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@p53 thanks for your response. The folder is created by the package installation but it remains empty until elasticsearch is started. Once elasticsearch is started we should not removed this folder because important data can reside in it.\n\nI'll update the script to not fail when deleting this folder. In worst case an empty folder won't be deleted.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
