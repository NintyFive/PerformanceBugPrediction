This may be related to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15432 , but it is unclear in #15432 what the cause was.   So I am filing a separate ticket on this.\n\nIn short, it looks like when snapshot restore is running, if the indices are closed while it is operating on a shard, it will leave the snapshot restore request in a STARTED state.\n\n```\n    \"restore\" : {\n      \"snapshots\" : [ {\n        \"snapshot\" : \"snapshot_name\",\n        \"repository\" : \"repository_name\",\n        \"state\" : \"STARTED\",\n```\n\nAnd shards that are in INIT state as reported by the restore request:\n\n```\n{\n          \"index\" : \"pricing_2015121502\",\n          \"shard\" : 1,\n          \"state\" : \"INIT\"\n}\n```\n\nSo that when the end user tries to kick off another restore, it will fail:\n\n```\nfailed to restore snapshot\norg.elasticsearch.snapshots.ConcurrentSnapshotExecutionException: [repository_name:snapshot_name] Restore process is already running in this cluster\n    at org.elasticsearch.snapshots.RestoreService$1.execute(RestoreService.java:174)\n    at org.elasticsearch.cluster.service.InternalClusterService$UpdateTask.run(InternalClusterService.java:374)\n    at org.elasticsearch.common.util.concurrent.PrioritizedEsThreadPoolExecutor$TieBreakingPrioritizedRunnable.runAndClean(PrioritizedEsThreadPoolExecutor.java:196)\n    at org.elasticsearch.common.util.concurrent.PrioritizedEsThreadPoolExecutor$TieBreakingPrioritizedRunnable.run(PrioritizedEsThreadPoolExecutor.java:162)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n```\n\nBecause only 1 snapshot restore request can be run at any point in time.  \n\nIt will be a good idea for us to implement a check to prevent users from closing indices while the restore operation is working on those shards which will help prevent this type of issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
