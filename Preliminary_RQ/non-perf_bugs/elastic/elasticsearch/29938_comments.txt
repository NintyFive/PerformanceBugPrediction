However, the C++ has constants that contain `.ml-state` which is confusing, and these should be removed.  Currently the C++ \"index\" variables are just used for unit tests that persist to a directory instead of to Elasticsearch.  The \"index\" is the directory name.  But this should be renamed to something like \"dummy_index_for_testing\" to avoid confusion.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/598056624","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29938#issuecomment-598056624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29938","id":598056624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODA1NjYyNA==","user":{"login":"przemekwitek","id":19312454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzEyNDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19312454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek","html_url":"https://github.com/przemekwitek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T08:04:18Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T08:04:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ILM policy for `.ml-state*` is implemented in `master` and `7.x`.\r\nI'm starting work on the last missing piece i.e. removing empty `.ml-state*` indices.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
