That is:\r\n1. On console snippets we can\r\n 1. Replace `[source,js]` with `[source,console]`\r\n 2. Remove `// CONSOLE`\r\n2. On console response snippets we can\r\n 1. Replace `[source,js]` with `[source,console-result]`\r\n 2. Remove `// TESTRESPONSE` if it doesn't have any special operations like `s`\r\n\r\nThe first on is nice because it makes the docs consistent with how they actually work in Asciidoctor. The second one does that too but *also* will allow clients to override those snippets when they are overriding request snippets.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
