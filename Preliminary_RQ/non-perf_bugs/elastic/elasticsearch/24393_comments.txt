You can open a topic on the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) if you think this merits discussion. However, I think we are unlikely to consider this, adding a license requires a cluster state update through a master node. Dropping these on disk raises tricky issues: what if it's missing the current master node? What if there are inconsistent license files on disk on two master-eligible nodes? What if the file is replaced while the cluster is online? We have a simple solution to these and others problems today: apply the license through the API and let the current master broadcast the license to the nodes in the cluster.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
