First, there is no real library libelasticsearch at all, so it's misleading. Instead I'd love to see separate packages for the dependecies (guice, netty, gnu trove, joda etc.) and let the package manager resolve the dependencies. This is a lot of effort and double the Maven deps, but it could be worth it when the aim should be the integration of ES into Linux distributions -  they have strict packaging guidelines. Also, as far as I understand, Shay uses some (slightly) modified versions and moves them into the org.elasticsearch package hierarchy. This is different from Tomcat or Jetty. The conclusion is for me that preparing an ES package is preferable with Shay's modifications included. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/4400177","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1697#issuecomment-4400177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1697","id":4400177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDAxNzc=","user":{"login":"dhardy92","id":898473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/898473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-03-08T19:19:55Z","updated_at":"2012-03-08T19:19:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The libelasticsearch package would be just the same that the one existing today but without config and init script.\nThat allow tiers java applications to depend on it easily without seeing a unwanted node starting beside the app and joining a ghost cluster. \nIt also permit sysops to maintain versions of ES (for a whole cluster with tons of projets using it) without deploy a new version of all the tiers app using it (meaning supplementary job for devs to release) : just upgrade ES an rolling restart the apps it works for everybody and the whole cluster is up to date.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/4752495","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1697#issuecomment-4752495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1697","id":4752495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTI0OTU=","user":{"login":"dhardy92","id":898473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/898473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy92/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-03-28T10:16:59Z","updated_at":"2012-03-28T10:16:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Maybe one thing could be done: just prevent elastic search for starting up after startup, upgrade or installation.\n\nin /etc/default/elasticsearch add :\nAVAILABLE=False\n\nin init script start with :\n\nif [ ${AVAILABLE} == \"False\" ];
