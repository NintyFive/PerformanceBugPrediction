There is Dev Tools but it doesnt provide live API. It will make things super easy if there is a live API gets installed with elasticsearch and is available as new tab in kibana where users select pre-formatted queries and can just plug in values and run those queries. Users should also be able to tag some of them as favourts ( or the system should keep the frequently used operations on the top  ).\r\n\r\n**Proposal:**\r\n\r\n - Implementing it as a plugin\r\n - something like this   : `/bin/plugin-install elastic-live` \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
