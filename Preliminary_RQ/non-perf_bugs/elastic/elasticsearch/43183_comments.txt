Hope this clarifies what I mean by partial network partitioning.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> I think this is fixed in 7.x by #32006, and we're unlikely to take any action to address this in the 6.x series.

It also doesn't seem very likely to occur in the wild. It's always possible to find a partition that results in unavailability (e.g. disconnect all pairs of nodes) so we must make choices about the kinds of partition that are reasonable to tolerate. Typically we choose to concentrate on the ones that occur in practice in a properly-configured network, which don't look like this.\r\n\r\nClosing this as there's no further action required here, but please do report back on your experiments with 7.x.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
