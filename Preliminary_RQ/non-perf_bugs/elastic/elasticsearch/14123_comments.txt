In this case, the user is on Windows and using powershell's convert-to-json functionality which makes it easy to iterate the json output and has a pretty complete set of monitoring scripts based on the non-cat apis.  It's certainly easy to update those scripts to workaround this behavior though.  So this is just to gauge the level of effort for us to display the primary copy first which may benefit other folks who use the non-cat apis. Certainly not a high priority item to address, just something nice to have if we have spare time :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/148472716","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14123#issuecomment-148472716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14123","id":148472716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODQ3MjcxNg==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-15T17:56:49Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T17:56:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jasontedor I quickly glanced at things - so I might be missing something but isn't this a question of sorting the shard list in the IndexShardRoutingTable constructor/builder: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/routing/IndexShardRoutingTable.java#L77\n\nThis list is super short, so the overhead should be negligible....\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/148662527","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14123#issuecomment-148662527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14123","id":148662527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODY2MjUyNw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-16T09:12:57Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T09:12:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We discussed this during fix-it-Friday and have come to the conclusion to not favor any one particular sort order over any other.
