As it only had itself on the unicast ping list, it could not find the nodes of the previous cluster. This behavior has been changed/fixed in 5.2 (the node does not make changes to disco-nodes list when it is not master anymore): https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/21092","performed_via_github_app":null}]
