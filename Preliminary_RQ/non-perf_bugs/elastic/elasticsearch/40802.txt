Currently only the naming (start with a `.`) sets them apart from any other index in the cluster. They have no real isolation; they can easily (and mistakenly) have mapping overridden, deleted, etc. \r\n\r\nMaybe add something in the index settings to serve as metadata, eg. `system_owned: true`. This could be used to prevent normal operations from applying to these indices, and require a special url parameter to be set in order to make modifications.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce a \"system\" index: `PUT .my_system_index`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
