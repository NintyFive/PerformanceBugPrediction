as well...\n\nthis will also be a great opportunity to differentiate between scripts & template (today we treat templates as scripts, while they are two different beasts... specially with template needing a context of escaping)\n\n> When developing this we should think about bwc too, we can the first time we start ES after a full cluster restart decide to copy the scripts from the dedicated index into the cluster state, if we see there is a script index, but no scripts are in the cluster state.\n\nwould be great if we do this for 3.0 and instead of having this migration done automatically, I think it's better to provide a tool that will do that as part of the 2.x->3.0 migration path.\n\n> Also we should then maybe rename indexed scripts, to stored scripts or something like that.\n\n+1\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/183933699","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16651#issuecomment-183933699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16651","id":183933699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MzkzMzY5OQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-14T17:30:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-14T17:30:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Related
