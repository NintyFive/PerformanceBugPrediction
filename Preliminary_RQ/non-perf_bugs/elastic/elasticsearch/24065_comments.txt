You might find that this already meets your needs.\r\n\r\nAs far as the specific proposal here, my take is that unless there is a very clear, large benefit from this we should be reluctant to add formal JSON schemas. The reason I think is because something like this comes with a high maintenance cost. To reduce this maintenance cost, we would want support in the build for it, either to fail the build if the schema is misaligned with the code, or to have the schemas automatically generated from the code. Yet that carries a large upfront infrastructure cost so I'm back to wondering whether there is a very clear, large benefit here.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/294171535","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24065#issuecomment-294171535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24065","id":294171535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDE3MTUzNQ==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-14T15:14:27Z","updated_at":"2017-04-14T21:58:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We discussed this as part of FixItFriday. We have REST spec for urls and params, but we have no spec for request and response bodies. It would be nice to have a body spec not only for the mappings API, but for all of our API. That could help the knowledge base in Sense, and help high level clients generating requests and reading responses back. It could also be used as some sort of documentation.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed this quite a few times. We would like to have this, the .NET client team has made some effort in this direction. I think we tried json schema a while ago but it turned out to be not flexible enough for our needs. Swagger may have had similar problems if I remember correctly. From recent discussions it was clear that if we make this effort, those spec would be part of the elasticsearch repo together with the existing spec.\r\n\r\nWe may look at this again as part of the Java High Level client effort further down the road, yet it is a big project and I am not sure when we will get to it. I will close this issue for now, we will open a new one whenever we have a concrete plan on how to tackle this. I don't think we'll want to accept external contributions on this as we would have to make it work the way that our clients would use it , in a format that makes everybody happy etc. so it is probably easier if it comes from us.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/294230079","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24065#issuecomment-294230079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24065","id":294230079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDIzMDA3OQ==","user":{"login":"matt-allan","id":9440455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NDA0NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9440455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-allan","html_url":"https://github.com/matt-allan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-allan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-allan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-allan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-allan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-allan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-allan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-allan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-allan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-allan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-14T20:26:28Z","updated_at":"2017-04-14T20:26:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Alrighty,  Thanks for the quick response and all the info!","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/408691006","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24065#issuecomment-408691006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24065","id":408691006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODY5MTAwNg==","user":{"login":"jmlucjav","id":1813237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTMyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1813237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmlucjav","html_url":"https://github.com/jmlucjav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmlucjav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmlucjav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmlucjav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmlucjav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmlucjav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmlucjav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmlucjav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmlucjav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmlucjav/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-29T17:01:30Z","updated_at":"2018-07-29T17:01:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I needed this so I created a small script to generate JSON Schema from Elasticsearch mappings: [elasticsearch2jsonschema](https://github.com/jmlucjav/elasticsearch2jsonschema.git)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/459674167","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24065#issuecomment-459674167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24065","id":459674167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTY3NDE2Nw==","user":{"login":"shusson","id":2106638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDY2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2106638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shusson","html_url":"https://github.com/shusson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shusson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shusson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shusson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shusson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shusson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shusson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shusson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shusson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shusson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-01T10:17:02Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T10:17:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"any updates on this @javanna ?
