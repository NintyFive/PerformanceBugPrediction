I agree that something needs to be done. The discussion got a bit stuck as we considered removing the ability to configure clusters in the configuration file, but we got feedback that some users like that.\r\n\r\nNote that `skip_unavailable` is only applied when searching, it does not have an impact on registration of clusters. The different behaviour between registering through  update cluster settings API or configuration file is independent of the `skip_unavailable` setting and that was the case even before introducing such flag.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest closing in favour of #27006 and reviving #27006 so we re-discuss it and act on it.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/424694549","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34018#issuecomment-424694549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34018","id":424694549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDY5NDU0OQ==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-26T12:20:52Z","updated_at":"2018-09-26T12:20:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@javanna thanks.
