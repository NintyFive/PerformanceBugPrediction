I am facing a unique problem with FunctionScore Query Java API. I am placing a bool filter inside the function score query in an effort to combine multiple queries. But the problem is, with only a single filter as part of the bool filter it is working fine. The moment I add another filter to the bool filter, the client is getting stuck and I am getting a timeout exception. However the same with curl is working. Please help me in this regard. My query is \n\n{\n  \"function_score\" : {\n    \"filter\" : {\n      \"bool\" : {\n        \"should\" : [ {\n          \"term\" : {\n            \"showId\" : \"85ef1da5-db78-3fd2-86a4-8c9ff3f053d0\"\n          }\n        }, {\n          \"term\" : {\n            \"showId\" : \"e275549d-143e-37e8-8689-44a805b957da\"\n          }\n        } ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"functions\" : [ {\n      \"filter\" : {\n        \"term\" : {\n          \"showId\" : \"85ef1da5-db78-3fd2-86a4-8c9ff3f053d0\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"boost_factor\" : 40.0\n    }, {\n      \"filter\" : {\n        \"term\" : {\n          \"showId\" : \"e275549d-143e-37e8-8689-44a805b957da\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"boost_factor\" : 35.0\n    } ]\n  }\n}\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
