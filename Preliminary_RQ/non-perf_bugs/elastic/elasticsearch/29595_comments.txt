I would like to not implement it on this query builder and recommend users to fetch terms on the client side.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/383099914","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29595#issuecomment-383099914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29595","id":383099914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzA5OTkxNA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-20T13:42:42Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T13:42:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Discussed in FixitFriday: we won't implement it for the reasons mentioned above.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/417693476","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29595#issuecomment-417693476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29595","id":417693476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzY5MzQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"Ghost93","id":4268710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4268710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ghost93","html_url":"https://github.com/Ghost93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ghost93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ghost93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ghost93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ghost93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ghost93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ghost93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ghost93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ghost93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ghost93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-31T15:06:13Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T15:06:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\nWe are looking to manipulate a score of terms lookup query using the amount of matched terms and could not find a way of doing so. \r\nMaybe we could achieve something similar using lookup terms set query with manipulation of the ```minimum_should_match_script``` field.\r\nAny chances the Elastic team reconsiders this?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
