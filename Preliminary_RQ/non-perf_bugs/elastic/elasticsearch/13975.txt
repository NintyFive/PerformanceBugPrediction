Ideally we want to keep historical data, however we do not need the same resolution of older historical data. For example we don't need to know CPU usage at 10:32AM two years ago...  Ideally we would be able to thin the data of a time-series by removing events within a given interval.  (Granted this would cause an issue with our Count Aggregations, it would be useful to be able to apply a multiplier to tween the data, so we can still see count stats like throughput)\n\nAre there any tools, that people have used with elasticsearch to accomplish this kind of stuff?\n","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
