Have you tried using `require_field_match`? Your query queries the `_all` field, yet you are highlighting the `url` field which is a different one. By default, anything in the `url` query will not match for highlighting, but if you wish to highlight any field although they were not queries directly, you can set `require_field_match` to `false`. Hopefully that is the issue you encountered here.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
