I can see this could be achieved by adding a 'snapshot' action to the delete phase to induce a wait on an SLM policy, as suggested. However, currently, snapshot lifecycle policies are very backup-oriented and do not support archiving terribly well imo - archiving usually needs to be triggered by the age of an index. As far as I can tell, there is no elegant way of ensuring that an SLM policy selects only indices of a certain age for its snapshot. If such capability was added, this proposal would suit my purposes perfectly. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
