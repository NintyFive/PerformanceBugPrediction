There is simply no usecase to get 10k configs using 1 request.\r\n\r\nThe number of transforms of per page should be limited. Even if possible, it's bad from a design as the memory requirement for returning this large number puts the rest of the system at risk to go out of memory. If you really have a lot of transforms you can use paging, a page should not return more than 500 configs per page. \r\n\r\nI agree that `DataFrameFeatureSet#Usage` is broken at the moment, but the fix is to rewrite stats gathering and not introduce paging for it. `Usage` accumulates stats, we can use aggregations to retrieve those.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
