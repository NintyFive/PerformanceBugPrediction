Feature request -->\r\n\r\n**Describe the feature**:\r\n\r\nWhen calculating the efficiency score of the elasticsearch 7.4.0 image with `https://github.com/wagoodman/dive` the image receives a very bad score of **81% efficiency** and a **potential wasted space of 305MB**.\r\n\r\nThe wasted space includes files like\r\n\r\n```\r\nTotal Space  Path\r\n35   MB  /var/lib/rpm/Packages\r\n11   MB  /usr/bin/ld.gold\r\n 6.4 MB  /usr/bin/dwp\r\n 5.1 MB  /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive\r\n 5.0 MB  /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.1.0.2k\r\n 4.3 MB  /usr/lib64/libc-2.17.so\r\n 3.7 MB  /usr/lib64/libdb-5.3.so\r\n 3.7 MB  /usr/lib64/libpython2.7.so.1.0\r\n 3.5 MB  /var/lib/rpm/Providename\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor which it's questionable whether they're used at runtime. Perhaps the image can be made more efficient by moving all the `COPY` steps to the top, combining all the `RUN` statements (resulting in 1 layer) and cleaning unused files added during the `RUN` steps.\r\n\r\nYou can run the analysis with the following commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install dive\r\ndive docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.4.0\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"pugnascotia","id":8696382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTYzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8696382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia","html_url":"https://github.com/pugnascotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
