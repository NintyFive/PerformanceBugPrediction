I think adding support for this, makes sense to have distributed idf. \n\nThe explain api behaves the same distribute wise as the get api. Maybe it makes better sense to add just support for global document frequency via a new `dfs` boolean parameter. The `search_type` defines how to execute a distributed search. For the explain api the `search_type` value `count` wouldn't make sense for the explain api.. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/25313096","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2612#issuecomment-25313096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2612","id":25313096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzEzMDk2","user":{"login":"beyang","id":1646931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDY5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1646931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyang","html_url":"https://github.com/beyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-29T02:35:06Z","updated_at":"2013-09-29T02:35:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1 on this.  It would be nice to do an apples-to-apples comparison for those of us using dfs_query_then_fetch when trying to figure out why a particular document is not showing up in search results.
