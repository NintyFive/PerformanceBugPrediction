I'm seeing geo_polygon behave oddly when the input polygon cross the date line. From a quick look at GeoPolygonFilter.GeoPolygonDocSet.pointInPolygon it doesn't seem that this is explicitly handled. \n\nThe reproduce this create an index/mapping as:\n\nPOST /geo\n\n``` json\n{ \"mappings\": { \"docs\": { \"properties\": { \"p\": { \"type\": \"geo_point\" } } } } }\n```\n\nUpload a document:\n\nPUT /geo/docs/1\n\n``` json\n{ \"p\": { \"lat\": 40, \"lon\": 179 } }\n```\n\nSearch with a polygon that's a box around the uploaded point and that crosses the date line:\n\nPOST /geo/docs/_search\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"filter\": { \"geo_polygon\": { \"p\": { \"points\": [\n      { \"lat\": 42, \"lon\": 178 },\n      { \"lat\": 39, \"lon\": 178 },\n      { \"lat\": 39, \"lon\": -179 },\n      { \"lat\": 42, \"lon\": -179 },\n      { \"lat\": 42, \"lon\": 178 }\n  ] } } }\n}\n```\n\nES returns 0 results. If I use a polygon that stays to the west of the date line I do get results:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"filter\": { \"geo_polygon\": { \"p\": { \"points\": [\n      { \"lat\": 42, \"lon\": 178 },\n      { \"lat\": 39, \"lon\": 178 },\n      { \"lat\": 39, \"lon\": 179.5 },\n      { \"lat\": 42, \"lon\": 179.5 },\n      { \"lat\": 42, \"lon\": 178 }\n  ] } } }\n}\n```\n\nAlso, if I use a bounding box query with the same coordinates as the initial polygon, it does work:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"filter\": { \"geo_bounding_box\": { \"p\": \n    { \"top_left\": { \"lat\": 42, \"lon\": 178 },\n       \"bottom_right\": { \"lat\": 39, \"lon\": -179 }\n     }\n  } }\n}\n```\n\nIt seems that this code needs to either split the check into east and west checks or normalize the input values.
