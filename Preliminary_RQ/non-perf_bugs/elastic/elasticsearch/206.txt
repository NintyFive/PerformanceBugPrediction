Basically, because of the write once nature of files, the local location of the index can be kept, and then only the diffs can be copied from the gateway.\n\nThats a bit tricky with how elasticsearch works now. The ability to start more than one node on a machine, and the fact that the data local data is deleted when the node is bought down. The local data can be kept around if there is a configured gateway, and deleted if there isn't.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
