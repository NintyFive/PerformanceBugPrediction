Our initial implementation to do this check was:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /_ilm/policy/{name}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with the above is that it throws an exception on the Elasticsearch side which I don't like as I only want to check if it is there. The current solution I was pointed to, to work around this is using the following: \r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /_ilm/policy/?filter_path={name}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I would prefer to see is heaving a HEAD request for this as we have in other API's:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHEAD /_ilm/policy/{name}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
