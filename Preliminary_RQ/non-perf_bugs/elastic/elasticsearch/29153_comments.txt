Making this setting dynamic would amplify the impact of a compromised server. For the users, who have other methods of protecting access to elasticsearch, there is an easy workaround of essentially disabling this setting by using a wildcard for the local domain, local subnet mask or even just `*:9200` to completely open it.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed this and decided not to make this setting dynamic at this moment, but we might revisit this to possibly make this a cluster-wide setting during zen discovery redesign.
