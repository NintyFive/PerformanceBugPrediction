version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`):\r\n5.6.2\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: []\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`):\r\njava version \"1.8.0_121\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system):\r\nMac OS 10.11\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n`/_nodes/stats` reports wrong values for `transport.tx_size_in_bytes`\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\nSetup a cluster with two nodes or more and compare `transport.tx_size_in_bytes` reported by `/_nodes/stats` with figures recorded via network tracing tool like wireshark or similar.\r\n\r\nAfter a few debugging sessions it looks like that it boils down to `Netty4MessageChannelHandler.write` which retrieves the readable bytes of the `ByteBuf` as a promise listener.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void write(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Object msg, ChannelPromise promise) throws Exception {\r\n        if (msg instanceof ByteBuf && transportServiceAdapter != null) {\r\n            // record the number of bytes send on the channel\r\n            promise.addListener(f -> transportServiceAdapter.addBytesSent(((ByteBuf) msg).readableBytes()));\r\n        }\r\n        ctx.write(msg, promise);\r\n    }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nFor me it looks that the code should be something more like:\r\n<pre>\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void write(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Object msg, ChannelPromise promise) throws Exception {\r\n        if (msg instanceof ByteBuf && transportServiceAdapter != null) {\r\n            // record the number of bytes send on the channel\r\n            final int bytesSent = ((ByteBuf) msg).readableBytes());\r\n            promise.addListener(f -> transportServiceAdapter.addBytesSent(bytesSent));\r\n        }\r\n        ctx.write(msg, promise);\r\n    }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nES 6.0.0-rc2 works correctly btw.","closed_by":{"login":"tbrooks8","id":862472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjQ3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/862472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrooks8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
