Have a snapshot repository using my swift plugin. The snapshot plugin has worked for us before on smaller subsets of indexes. I attempted a rather large snapshot of all our currently running indexes (about 1700 or so) with the usual:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -s -XPUT localhost:9200/_snapshots/backups/cirrus-initial-all?wait_for_completion=false -d '{\n  \"ignore_unavailable\": \"true\",\n  \"include_global_state\": false\n}'\n```\n\nWaited for a bit, not a lot seemed to be happening. Querying the snapshot showed it as IN_PROGRESS. I didn't see any data getting written to Swift though. I Ctrl+C'd out of the snapshot and now all of /_snapshots/backups/ seems hung up from GET requests. Can't seem to get a DELETE on the snapshot to go through, and the nuclear option of issuing a DELETE on the whole repository returned a message about it being in use. ES error logs contain nothing relevant that I see.\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
