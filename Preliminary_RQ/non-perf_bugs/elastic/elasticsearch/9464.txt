was trying to use the _cat/master API to get the name of the current master in a shell script, and then to determine whether the current host is the master.\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\nname=`curl -sf 'http://localhost:9200' | jq --raw-output .name`\nmaster=`curl -sf 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/master?h=node' `\n\n[ \"${name}\" = \"${master}\" ]\n```\n\nThe problem here is that `master` will actually contain the name of the node _and a space character_, so the line needs to be fixed to look like this:\n\n```\nmaster=`curl -sf 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/master?h=node' | xargs echo`\n```\n\nThis was very surprising, and makes using these APIs for scripting harder (without adding anything for the human reader).\n\nQuick reading through the code: this space seems to come from `org.elasticsearch.rest.action.support.RestTable#buildTextPlainResponse()`.\n\nPS: Is there a \"nicer\" way to determine whether the current node is a master from shell script, without having to parse JSON?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
