Instead the interval sniffer is using is SnifferBuilder.setSniffIntervalMillis\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nUse following code which was taken from elastic doc [:](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/_usage.html)\r\n\r\n```\r\nSniffOnFailureListener sniffOnFailureListener = new SniffOnFailureListener();\r\nRestClient restClient = RestClient.builder(new HttpHost(\"localhost\", 9200))\r\n    .setFailureListener(sniffOnFailureListener) \r\n    .build();\r\nSniffer sniffer = Sniffer.builder(restClient)\r\n    .setSniffAfterFailureDelayMillis(30000) \r\n    .build();\r\nsniffOnFailureListener.setSniffer(sniffer); \r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the reason of the bug is in method `Sniffer.Task.sniff()`.\r\nThe first call to `Sniffer.Task.sniff()` is done for `setSniffIntervalMillis` timeout which is blocked in `hostsSniffer.sniffHosts()`.\r\nDuring that time, for each failed node, `Sniffer.Task.sniff()` is called with `setSniffAfterFailureDelayMillis` timeout. Since the first call is still blocking in `Sniffer.Task.sniff()` it cannot call `scheduleNextRun` with `setSniffAfterFailureDelayMillis` because `if (running.compareAndSet(false, true))` condition prevents it from. When all failed nodes are sniffed, `hostsSniffer.sniffHosts()` returns and set the time again to `setSniffIntervalMillis`.\r\n\r\nI think the in the Exception statement, you should set `nextSniffDelayMillis` to be equal to `sniffAfterFailureDelayMillis` and in case of success set `nextSniffDelayMillis` to `setSniffIntervalMillis`.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
