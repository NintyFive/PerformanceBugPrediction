For instance, a primary shard might be sitting on a disk which is over the high watermark, or it may have allocation filtering which prevents it from being allocated to the node where it already exists.  Today, we just go ahead and try to assign the primary regardless of the allocation deciders (which means that we also don't limit retries to 5).\n\nInstead, we could add extra logic to the appropriate deciders to say \"always return `YES` if the shard in question is a primary which already exists on this node\".  The decision returned would be `YES`, but the explanation provided by the reroute or cluster allocation explain could include the reason this decider was ignored.\n\n/cc @ywelsch @dakrone @s1monw \n\nRelated to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18321\n","closed_by":{"login":"abeyad","id":1631297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzEyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1631297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad","html_url":"https://github.com/abeyad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
