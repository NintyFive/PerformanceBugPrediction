A setting can come from a lower order template that is not compatible with the new field configuration in a higher order template. The example considers keyword and text fields for the setting \"ignore_above\".\n\nI believe the issue has been resolved in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/20630 which adds better merging.  However, can we do something more intelligent on the merging? It seems like users would like to be able to override the type.\n\n```\nDELETE test1\n\nPUT /_template/template_1\n{\n  \"template\": \"test1\",\n  \"order\" : 10,\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test_type\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"test_field\": {\n          \"type\": \"keyword\",\n          \"ignore_above\": 10\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT /_template/template_2\n{\n  \"template\": \"test1\",\n  \"order\" : 11,\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test_type\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"test_field\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPOST test1/test_type\n{\n  \"test_field\": \"foo\"\n}\n\nGET test1/_mapping\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"hub-cap","id":613352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzM1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/613352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap","html_url":"https://github.com/hub-cap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
