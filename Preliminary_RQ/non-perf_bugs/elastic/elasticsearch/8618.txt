I'm starting a master node and creating\na 1/1 index. The master now holds the primary shard but replica shard is now marked as unassigned. Bringing up another node makes it join the cluster but the replica is not moved there.\n\nMy setup is pretty much default. I thought it might be because of auto assigned IPs\nso I changed `network.publish_host` to all the IPs available with `ifconfig` \n(except for loopbacks). In every case it worked yet the replica was not moved to the\nnew node and stayed unassigned.\n\nI'm out of ideas, so can please someone help in any way?\n\nThanks a lot :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"dmitrybelyakov","id":178866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/178866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrybelyakov","html_url":"https://github.com/dmitrybelyakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrybelyakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrybelyakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrybelyakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrybelyakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrybelyakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrybelyakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrybelyakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrybelyakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrybelyakov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
