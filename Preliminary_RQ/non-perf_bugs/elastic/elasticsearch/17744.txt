We close them after a period of inactivity and re-open them the next time they're needed. If a large number of requests come in to open closed indices, this causes the put-mapping events generated by bulk indexing threads to hit the 30 second time out and fail.\n\nFrom watching the pending_tasks list, I suspect (but could be very wrong here) that it's because the open requests insert cluster state tasks of 'shard-started' with URGENT priority. The indexing jobs insert cluster state tasks of 'put-mapping' with HIGH priority. It appears that the URGENT ones always process before the HIGH ones, effectively blocking any indexing jobs.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Create a bunch of indices. 1000's\n2. Close all of them\n3. Start a loop opening those closed indices one at a time\n4. Start indexing a new index\n5. Your indexing job will now fail with a timeout processing cluster event put-mapping\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\nProcessClusterEventTimeoutException[failed to process cluster event (put-mapping [response]) within 30s]\n        at org.elasticsearch.cluster.service.InternalClusterService$2$1.run(InternalClusterService.java:343)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(Unknown Source)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(Unknown Source)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
