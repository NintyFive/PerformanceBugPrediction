The bounding box to filter upon would be the geohash itself. My idea for the syntax is something like below:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"filtered\" : {\n        \"query\" : {\n            \"match_all\" : {}\n        },\n        \"filter\" : {\n            \"geo_bounding_box\" : {\n                \"pin.location\" : {\n                    \"cell\" : \"drm3btev3\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCould this use case be of common interest?\n","closed_by":{"login":"chilling","id":2590333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTAzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2590333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling","html_url":"https://github.com/chilling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
