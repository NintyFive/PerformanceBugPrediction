If you can stop \r\nby there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified \r\nbug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\nThe Kibana or logstash forums may be more relevant than elasticsearch in this case.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/)\r\nthat should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I \r\nhope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
