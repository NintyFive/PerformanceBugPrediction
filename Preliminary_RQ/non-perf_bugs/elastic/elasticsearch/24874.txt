Create an index with a date field as the following mapping:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"mappings\": {\r\n        \"foo\": {\r\n            \"properties\": {\r\n                \"foobar\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"integer\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"created\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"date\",\r\n                    \"format\": \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Insert a document:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"foobar\": 1,\r\n\t\"created\": \"2017-05-24 19:46:13\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Query documents created this month or before:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n    \t\"range\": {\r\n\t      \"created\": {\r\n\t        \"lte\": \"2017-05\",\r\n\t        \"format\": \"yyyy-MM\"\r\n\t      }\r\n\t    }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe query above should return the document created in step 2 because they have same years and months. However, it won't match this query.\r\n\r\nIt looks like days are being considered in that query even though I didn't pass days in `format` field,  because that query with `gte` instead works.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**: none\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"abeyad","id":1631297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzEyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1631297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad","html_url":"https://github.com/abeyad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
