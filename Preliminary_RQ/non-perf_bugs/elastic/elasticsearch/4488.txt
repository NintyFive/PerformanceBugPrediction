Note, this will prevent allocations for newly created indices. This setting really make sense when dynamically updating it using the cluster update settings API.\n\n`cluster.routing.allocation.disable_allocation`:\n\nAllows to disable either primary or replica allocation (does not apply to newly created primaries, see disable_new_allocation above). Note, a replica will still be promoted to primary if one does not exist. This setting really make sense when dynamically updating it using the cluster update settings API.\n\n`cluster.routing.allocation.disable_replica_allocation`:\n\nAllows to disable only replica allocation. Similar to the previous setting, mainly make sense when using it dynamically using the cluster update settings API.\n\nBesides the fact that `disable: true` reads a bit like a double negative, these settings seem to overlap.  Could we not merge them into a single setting:\n\n```\ncluster.routing.allocation.enable: all | primaries | new_primaries | none\n```\n\nwith the default set to `all`.\n\nThe existing disable allocation settings will be deprecated in favour for the enable allocation setting.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
