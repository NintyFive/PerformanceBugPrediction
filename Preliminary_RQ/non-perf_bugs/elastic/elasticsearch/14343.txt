I most recently noticed that on a node that had only been running for 4 hours, its node stats reported 3.8h of processing time spent on warmers. Is there some other operation other than true index warmers that are being reported in this category? On this same node, the thread pool stats reported `completed` values of about 1000:1 for warmer threads vs other operations (search, generic, etc).\n\nRelevant sections from the _indices_ and _thread_pool_ sections of `_nodes/stats`:\n\n``` json\n\"warmer\": {\n      \"current\": 0,\n      \"total\": 34628,\n      \"total_time\": \"3.8h\",\n      \"total_time_in_millis\": 13805427\n    }\n```\n\n[full indices section of _nodes/stats](https://gist.github.com/allthedrones/f27b1e1471c031fe7c52#file-node-stats-indexes-json)\n\n``` json\n\"warmer\": {\n      \"threads\": 4,\n      \"queue\": 0,\n      \"active\": 0,\n      \"rejected\": 0,\n      \"largest\": 4,\n      \"completed\": 24963774\n    }\n```\n\n[full thread_pool section of _nodes/stats](https://gist.github.com/allthedrones/f27b1e1471c031fe7c52#file-node-stats-threadpool-json)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
