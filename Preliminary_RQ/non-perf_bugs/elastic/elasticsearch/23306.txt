Setup was: \r\n- alias named \"allMyStuff\" with 3 indexes. Each of the three indexes have an internal, timestamped name, but there also exists an alias pointing to the most recent index. The client code only knows the alias, not the real index name.\r\n- query executes on \"allMyStaff\" alias and filters the indices to query using indicesQuery.\r\n\r\nThis works with indicesQuery, specifiying the alias to only run the specific query on and return matchAll for all the others. With a term query on \"_index\" field, you cannot use the alias anymore. It only return documents if the index matches completely, so termQuery(\"_index\", \"alias\") does not match anything.\r\n\r\nSo I don't agree with deprecating and removing indicesQuery unless this can be fixed.","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
