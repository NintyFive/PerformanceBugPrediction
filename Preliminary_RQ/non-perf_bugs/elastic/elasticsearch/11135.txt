I am using NEST libraries for this and I am facing the following issue\n\nQuery C# :\n\n```\n var searchRequest = new SearchRequest\n        {\n            SearchType = SearchType.Count, \n            Query = query,\n            Aggregations = new Dictionary<string, IAggregationContainer>\n            {\n                { \"a\", new AggregationContainer\n                            {\n                                ExtendedStats = new ExtendedStatsAggregator()\n                                {\n                                    Field = \"a\"\n                                }\n                            }\n                },\n               { \"b\", new AggregationContainer\n                            {\n                                ExtendedStats = new ExtendedStatsAggregator()\n                                {\n                                    Field = \"b\"\n                                }\n                            }\n                }\n            }\n        }; \n```\n\nWhen I receive response from NEST, however I am getting only result for one aggregation. I am looking at SearchResult.Agg dictionary but it has only one entry for one aggregation field instead of two. Let me know if I am missing soemthing or is it some issue with NEST libraries\n\nWhen I print the SearchResponse.ConnectionStatus I can see that both the aggregations are returned. The problem I am facing is that my SearchResults.Aggs.ExtendendStats() has only details of first aggregation.\n\nSome how the deserialization in NEST is dropping the second aggregation though the response correctly came from ES\n","closed_by":{"login":"Mpdreamz","id":245275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTI3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/245275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz","html_url":"https://github.com/Mpdreamz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
