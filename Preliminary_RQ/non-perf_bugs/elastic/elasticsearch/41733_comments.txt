Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for confirmed bug reports and feature requests, and since this works on one machine it's possible it's an environmental problem rather than a bug. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead so that others can benefit from searching for the problem in the future. Please add the \"machine learning\" tag to the forum post, as this looks like the problem affects the machine learning functionality.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
