a light weight windows PR check that does not extend the overall time the checks take, and uses one additional CI worker to run a subset of tests that will possibly break on windows (e.x. unit tests, some internal cluster tests).\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new  label, example `check-all` and `check-all-windows`. \r\nBoth will enable a full windows run on the PR, but the first implies that all such checks will be run. \r\nThis implies that we will add others in the future, like `check-all-packaging` and `check-all-bwc`.","closed_by":{"login":"mark-vieira","id":4106672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4106672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-vieira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
