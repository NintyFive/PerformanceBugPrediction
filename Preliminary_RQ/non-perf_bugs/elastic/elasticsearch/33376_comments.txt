It will be incredibly frustrating for users if they are not allowed to edit annotations, for example, after making a typo.\r\n\r\nThis leads on to the question of who can edit which annotations.  Ideally there would be object level security such that each user could only edit annotations they added, unless the owning user opened up the permissions to more users.  However, we do not currently have object level security.  (The same problem applies to job configs for example.)\r\n\r\nWe should not introduce a form of object level security purely for annotations.  Therefore we decided that if you can edit annotations you can edit any annotations.\r\n\r\nThere is also the question of whether creating and editing annotations should be an admin or user level privilege.  Most write actions require admin privileges.  However, that would cripple annotations  as it's likely they'll be most useful to people looking at the results, and these people do not require admin privileges.  Therefore we decided that the `machine_learning_user` role should allow adding and editing of annotations.  (The actions could still be admin actions, but the `machine_learning_user` role definition should incorporate them.  Alternatively the actions could be \"monitor\" actions, in which case no changes would be required to the definition of `machine_learning_user`.

The original description of this issue suggested simply a \"new result type\", but of course different jobs could be using different results indices, so which index should store an annotation that applies to multiple jobs?\r\n\r\nSome options are:\r\n\r\n1. Annotations always go in `.ml-anomalies-shared` no matter which job(s) they relate to\r\n2. Annotations are considered metadata rather than results, so go in `.ml-meta`\r\n3. We have a completely new index, `.ml-annotations` for annotations\r\n\r\nThe third option is nice because it makes it easier to grant write access to annotations to the `machine_learning_user` role without giving it write access to any other type of ML internal data.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/440338925","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33376#issuecomment-440338925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33376","id":440338925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDMzODkyNQ==","user":{"login":"walterra","id":230104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/230104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterra","html_url":"https://github.com/walterra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-20T16:34:57Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T16:34:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- The current state of discussion is that APIs will be exposed via Kibana only, everything necessary to be able to view/add/edit annotations from within the UI should be doable via Kibana without requiring any custom endpoints on the ML java plugin side.\r\n- However, automatically generated annotations might be done via the java plugin, it's just that this functionality is internal only and doesn't need any API endpoints.\r\n- One thing to consider though: If we store annotations in a custom index like `.ml-annotations` with special requirements, then at some point an index template needs to be setup, probably via the elasticsearch plugin.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/440346190","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33376#issuecomment-440346190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33376","id":440346190,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDM0NjE5MA==","user":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-20T16:54:06Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T16:54:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> * One thing to consider though: If we store annotations in a custom index like `.ml-annotations` with special requirements, then at some point an index template needs to be setup, probably via the elasticsearch plugin.\r\n\r\nYes, definitely we'll add this index in the ES code.
