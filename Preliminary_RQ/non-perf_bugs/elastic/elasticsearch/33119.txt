Bug report -->\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): 6.3.2 (but the same symptoms appear with 6.0.1 and 6.4.0, although I did not debug them).\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: [discovery-file, repository-s3]\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`):\r\n```\r\njava version \"1.8.0_144\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_144-b01)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.144-b01, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system):\r\nLinux 4efa9a510327 4.4.0-66-generic #87~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 3 17:32:36 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n`cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage` does not take effect when x-pack security is installed.\r\nThe logs show a message like:\r\n```\r\n[2018-08-24T08:07:51,796][WARN ][org.elasticsearch.cluster.routing.allocation.DiskThresholdMonitor] flood stage disk watermark [97%] exceeded on [1hFDDw9yRxGCIlfVRKuCCg][instance-0000000000][/app/data/nodes/0] free: 173.5mb[1.1%], all indices on this node will be marked read-only\r\n```\r\nbut settings are not applied to the indices.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a cluster with x-pack security\r\n 2. Make sure `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled` is enabled and configure `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage`\r\n 3. You should see on the logs something like:\r\n```\r\n[2018-08-24T08:07:51,796][WARN ][org.elasticsearch.cluster.routing.allocation.DiskThresholdMonitor] flood stage disk watermark [97%] exceeded on [1hFDDw9yRxGCIlfVRKuCCg][instance-0000000000][/app/data/nodes/0] free: 173.5mb[1.1%], all indices on this node will be marked read-only\r\n```\r\n4. I would expect that my indices become read-only, but it does not happen\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\nDid some debugging and it appears this exception is thrown:\r\n```\r\nElasticsearchSecurityException[action [indices:admin/settings/update] is unauthorized for user [_system]]\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.core.security.support.Exceptions.authorizationError(Exceptions.java:30)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authz.AuthorizationService.denialException(AuthorizationService.java:575)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authz.AuthorizationService.denial(AuthorizationService.java:553)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authz.AuthorizationService.authorize(AuthorizationService.java:158)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.action.filter.SecurityActionFilter.lambda$authorizeRequest$4(SecurityActionFilter.java:171)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authz.AuthorizationUtils$AsyncAuthorizer.maybeRun(AuthorizationUtils.java:173)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authz.AuthorizationUtils$AsyncAuthorizer.setRunAsRoles(AuthorizationUtils.java:167)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authz.AuthorizationUtils$AsyncAuthorizer.authorize(AuthorizationUtils.java:149)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.action.filter.SecurityActionFilter.authorizeRequest(SecurityActionFilter.java:183)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.action.filter.SecurityActionFilter.lambda$applyInternal$3(SecurityActionFilter.java:161)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.ActionListener$1.onResponse(ActionListener.java:60)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.AuthenticationService$Authenticator.lambda$writeAuthToContext$23(AuthenticationService.java:432)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.AuthenticationService$Authenticator.writeAuthToContext(AuthenticationService.java:441)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.AuthenticationService$Authenticator.lambda$handleNullToken$16(AuthenticationService.java:333)\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.AuthenticationService$Authenticator.handleNullToken(AuthenticationService.java:340)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand after some more debugging, it seems the culprit is https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v6.3.2/x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/core/security/authz/privilege/SystemPrivilege.java#L17-L27 which apparently should include (at the very least) permissions for `indices:admin/settings/update` or even `indices:admin/settings/*` (provided it does raise any security concerns).\r\n\r\nFWIW, I tried that (by compiling that class in 6.3.2 and substituting it) and it worked as expected after it\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bizybot","id":902768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjc2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/902768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot","html_url":"https://github.com/bizybot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
