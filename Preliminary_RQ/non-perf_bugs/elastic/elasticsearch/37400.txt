RolloverRequestBuilder mapping(String type, String source) {\r\n     this.request.getCreateIndexRequest().mapping(type, source);\r\n     return this;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nShould be:\r\n```java\r\npublic RolloverRequestBuilder mapping(String type, String... source) {\r\n     this.request.getCreateIndexRequest().mapping(type, source);\r\n     return this;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBecause I'm trying to create a mapping on each Rollover new index, but I'm getting:\r\n\r\n>mapping source must be pairs of fieldnames and properties definition.\r\n\r\nLooking the API I discovered the following issues:\r\nRolloverRequestBuilder.mapping calls:\r\n```java\r\n    public RolloverRequestBuilder mapping(String type, String source) {\r\n        this.request.getCreateIndexRequest().mapping(type, source);\r\n        return this;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nbut getCreateIndexRequest().mapping has a check:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public CreateIndexRequest mapping(String type, Object... source) {\r\n        mapping(type, PutMappingRequest.buildFromSimplifiedDef(type, source));\r\n        return this;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nand  XContentBuilder.buildFromSimplifiedDef validate if source is an even value.\r\n```java\r\n    public static XContentBuilder buildFromSimplifiedDef(String type, Object... source) {\r\n        if (source.length % 2 != 0) {\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"mapping source must be pairs of fieldnames and properties definition.\");\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nif RolloverRequestBuilder mapping(String type, String source) receive only one parameter as a source string, I will always get an error.  is that right? Or I'm getting crazy. I have tried to add my mapping on rolling index and I'm always getting an error.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nFabricio","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
