Until then it assumes it is a string and decodes the value `456` as such.\n\nMaybe you can try any of the mentioned work arounds? Fixing this isn't easy, since the query parsing that kicks in during storing a query doesn't introduce new fields in the mapping or has the capability to detect what type a field is.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/47662991","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6572#issuecomment-47662991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6572","id":47662991,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjYyOTkx","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-01T14:30:30Z","updated_at":"2014-07-01T14:30:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed in favour of #6664 \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
