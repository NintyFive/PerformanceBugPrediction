Factoring out the java API builders into a common library is an option, though we are not yet sure how long it is going to take, so we should experiment with that a bit. The main point is that we want to get the high level client out there as soon as possible, hence we might just start with making it depend on core, which is not worse than what the transport client already does, and already much better than in the past as it doesn't depend on guice anymore. The bigger part is probably taking out the `toQuery` method of query builders, as that one depends on lucene. Closing for now as we don't need a separate issue for this, but we will take it into account as part of #19055.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
