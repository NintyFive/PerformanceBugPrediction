This part seems plainly simple, but the implementation seems less obvious:\n- Do we stop backing off after awhile?\n  - Do we preset this or make it configurable?\n- Do we keep backing off until the node is restarted?\n\nThe only thing that I think is simple is that we can allow the backoff interval to be reset by dynamically setting the interval. Any strong thoughts either way?\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"tomcallahan","id":15988488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTg4NDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15988488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan","html_url":"https://github.com/tomcallahan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
