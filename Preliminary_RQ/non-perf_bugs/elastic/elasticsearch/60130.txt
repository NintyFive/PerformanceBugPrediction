When the whole cluster is shut down this will be killed simultaneously with the ML node, so may leave the cluster very slightly earlier.  On the ML node the ML jobs could be in the middle of writing results to the results index.  When the data node holding this index leaves the cluster these indexing requests on the ML node will fail.\r\n\r\nWe have logic in the `ResultsPersisterService` class that decides whether the errors received from an indexing request are permanently fatal or worth retrying.  At present, the situation of the data node holding the results index leaving the cluster is considered permanently fatal and causes the job to fail.  This is not what we want in this situation, because if the job had not failed then it would have restarted automatically after the cluster was restarted.\r\n\r\nThe logs below show the problem, in particular the \"should not retry indexing after [1] attempts\" messages:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7405510/88296941-3b2cc680-ccf7-11ea-8d4f-89469c5edf75.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
