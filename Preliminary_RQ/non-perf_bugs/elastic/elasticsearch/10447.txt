Under certain load test conditions with load driving against the client node only, the client node reaches a state where it can no longer handle indexing or query operations, and many administrative commands (_cat) fail.\n\n_cat/indices and _cat/shards will fail 100% of the time.  _cat/nodes will fail sometimes, succeed others.  This always occurs in a regular repeating pattern, with the same number of successes and failures each time.\n\nRestarting the client node always clears the problem.\n\nRestarting one of the data nodes may clear the problem.\n\nThe problem never occurs if there is only one data node.\n\nThe behavior around the restart of the data node suggests that this is caused by a hanging transport thread in the client.  When the data node connected to that thread is restarted, the transport thread is knocked loose and the client returns to normal operation.\n\nA test case that can regularly cause the problem is available on a separate machine in the same EC2 zone.  Please contact me for access to the test system where this can be reproduced.\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
