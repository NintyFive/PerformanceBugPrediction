Modern HTTP clients will get a random node in the cluster, but if it fails they'll automatically try the rest until one works [1], when it can then discover the rest of the cluster in the normal way. Currently AFAIK to guarantee a client will always work on startup (ie. before it has a chance to discover all the other nodes in the cluster) and for unicast zen to always work, it has to be supplied with a _current_ list of at least half (?) of the master-eligible nodes.\n\nThis would make the cluster rely on DNS to operate, although I expect most people refer to their nodes via DNS anyway, so doesn't add any further dependency for people who'd want to take advantage of this.\n\n[1] http://blog.engelke.com/2011/06/07/web-resilience-with-round-robin-dns/\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
