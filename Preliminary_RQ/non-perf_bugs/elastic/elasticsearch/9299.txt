The deb itself is Binary:all, and therefore can be installed on other architectures. Would it be possible to also provide metadata for other architectures supported by APT? I'm personally most interested in the arm64 (ARMv8) architecture, but the other architectures maybe useful to others.\n\nPerhaps this could be handled with a wildcard URL (/binary-*/Packages.gz) but if not, for reference, I've included the full set of supported or in-devel Linux-based ports below. Obviously most of them are not likely targets for a production elasticsearch cluster, but who am I to judge :)\n\nIf this is not feasible, please consider documenting a workaround for such users by adding an arch tag to the sources.list entry like so to tell apt to override the arch string:\ndeb [arch=amd64] http://packages.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/\n\nalpha\narmel\narmhf\nhppa\nia64\nm68k\nmips\nmipsel\npowerpc\npowerpcspe\nppc64\nppc64el\ns390\ns390x\nsh4\nsparc\nsparc64\nx32\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
