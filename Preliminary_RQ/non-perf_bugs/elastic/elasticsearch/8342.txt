At the moment, the convention is to name indices 'index-YYYY.MM.DD' implying the day it was created (because it's assumed only events from that day necessitated its creation).\n\nHowever, I see two possible uses for such an attribute:\n1. In the event the cluster is in recovery, more often than not I care about the most recent indices recovering before any others (i.e. the past 2 days). I'd like the recovery process to be configurable such that I can define a preference for those indices, based on their creation timestamp.\n2. It's not uncommon for \"future\" and \"past\" indices to show up due to servers/devices with faulty clocks or other weird phenomena such as mobile apps that bulk send logs (i.e. delayed) when connected to Wifi. Knowing when an index was created may help us identify what is happening. At a minimum, we'll have a more certain way to manage indices than the date implied in their name. For example, `curator` depends heavily on the naming convention described above; I'd like my tools to not be coupled to the names of my indices like this.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
