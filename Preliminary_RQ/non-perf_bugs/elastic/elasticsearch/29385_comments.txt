In which case opening a request in the Kibana repo would be better than here. I think that on the elasticsearch side, getting the \"last known value\" of a field, the best way indeed is to use a combination of `exists`, top hits with size=1 and sorting by whatever field orders your metric (e.g. a timestamp). Is there anything other than convenience that makes this option not viable for you?
