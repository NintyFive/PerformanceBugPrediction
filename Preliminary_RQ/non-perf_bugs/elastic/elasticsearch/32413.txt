Shouldn't the first search have returned at least 60 hits?\r\n\r\n*Example 2:*\r\n`value.keyword:*aBCD-904*` returns 0 hits\r\nwhereas:\r\n`value:\"aBCD-9041\"` returns 5 hits (containing dashes)\r\n\r\nAre keyword searches with wildcards approximate or something and not guaranteed to be accurate?  Is this explained somewhere in the docs and I just didn't see it?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nI've not been able to reproduce this with a small synthetic example but I'm happy to share more details about my scenario as needed.\r\n\r\nSome basic info:\r\nTotal index size is around 14m objects with 700 fields.  This index is distributed over 5 shards with single replication.","closed_by":{"login":"blfrantz","id":25988482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTg4NDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25988482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blfrantz","html_url":"https://github.com/blfrantz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blfrantz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blfrantz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blfrantz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blfrantz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blfrantz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blfrantz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blfrantz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blfrantz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blfrantz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
