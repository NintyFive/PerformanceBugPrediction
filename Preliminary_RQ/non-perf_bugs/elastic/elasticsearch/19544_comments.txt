Usually shapes like this come from fielddata which is a known defficiency in Elasticsearch that we've mostly migrated away from. It isn't the default for indexes created in 2.0 but if you migrated any indexes from 1.x to 2.x you'll still have indexes that use it.\n\nBecause this isn't a _new_ bug it is probably best discussed on https://discuss.elastic.co/ . If we can pin it down to a new bug then it makes sense to reopen here.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/234402945","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19544#issuecomment-234402945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19544","id":234402945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDQwMjk0NQ==","user":{"login":"dopey","id":1820847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1820847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dopey","html_url":"https://github.com/dopey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dopey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dopey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dopey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dopey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dopey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dopey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dopey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dopey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dopey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-21T22:26:09Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T22:26:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the reply!
