I am currently transporting the data from one to another via a Python script using pymongo and official elasticsearch 5.x python API.\r\n\r\nI had one problem, that it seems I'll have to solve by manually mapping types because dynamic mapping is parsing the strings:\r\n\r\n- OK\r\n- CRITICAL\r\n- UNKNOWN\r\n- OPEN\r\n\r\nAs if they were integers, and so it raises a `NumberFormatException`.\r\n\r\nI'd want to know if this is a known issue, and why is it caused for. If I find more strings that comply with this description, I'll let you know.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
