The shingle filter with unigrams is problematic since it creates side paths at every position. \r\nBut I agree that we should detect this situation earlier and fall back to the normal query analysis when the graph has too many side paths. I'll work on a solution, thanks for reporting this. \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/292509278","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23509#issuecomment-292509278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23509","id":292509278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjUwOTI3OA==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-07T11:06:29Z","updated_at":"2017-04-07T11:06:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is fixed by https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/23920\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
