And being able to kill tasks that have crashed more than X nodes (X can be fairly small, we never witnessed a \"randomly\" crashing of more than 2 nodes...).\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"koren88i","id":32966703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTY2NzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/32966703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koren88i","html_url":"https://github.com/koren88i","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koren88i/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koren88i/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koren88i/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koren88i/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koren88i/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koren88i/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koren88i/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koren88i/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koren88i/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
