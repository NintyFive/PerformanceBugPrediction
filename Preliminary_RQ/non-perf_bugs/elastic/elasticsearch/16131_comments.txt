Some comments/questions follow.\n\nI'm consolidating file sizes using the same criteria of `SegmentsStats` to expose disk usage of Lucene index files: `Terms`, `TermVectors`, `StoredFields`, `Norms`, `DocValues` (class `IndexResources` in `SegmentsStats`).\n\n`SegmentsStats` currently exposes memory consumption as bytes of each of the aforementioned so it's possible to add these as part of a class (`IndexResources`) and expose it as two fields of `SegmentsStats`, one for memory resources (existing stats) and other for disk resources. This is what I implemented in my branch, but I'm not sure if it would be better to expose this as another \"sister\" class of `SegmentsStats`, member of `CommonStats`, and leave `SegmentsStats` as it is. I'm however aware that my `toXContent` serialization could break clients expecting certain fields that now are placed elsewhere.\n\nSome other couple questions I've got:\n1. Is it necessary to consolidate sizes by the same criteria of `SegmentsStats` or may be better doing it using the file extensions? This last option has the advantage that would include additional information about postings, i.e., separate size info for positions, payloads, etc.\n2. The meat of the matter: Is the way I open the Directory from the `SegmentInfo` and the compound reader a sensible approach? I'm not sure if this could introduce issues with the `Store`.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/183747332","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16131#issuecomment-183747332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16131","id":183747332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mzc0NzMzMg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-13T20:22:51Z","updated_at":"2016-02-13T20:22:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@camilojd i'd suggest opening a PR to discuss this, even if it is a WIP\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/183976590","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16131#issuecomment-183976590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16131","id":183976590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mzk3NjU5MA==","user":{"login":"camilojd","id":527878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/527878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilojd","html_url":"https://github.com/camilojd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilojd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilojd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilojd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilojd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilojd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilojd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilojd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilojd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilojd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-14T20:56:33Z","updated_at":"2016-02-14T20:56:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will do! thanks @clintongormley \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/191832083","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16131#issuecomment-191832083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16131","id":191832083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTgzMjA4Mw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-03T16:15:10Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T16:15:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed by https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/16661\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
