Speaking to @dakrone, the original intention of this was that fixing the cause of a circuit breaker tripping requires human intervention on the server-side by an administrator / developer (e.g. when field data are too large).\r\n\r\nHowever, we have several more circuit breakers, e.g. the in-flight request circuit breaker, where the condition is only temporary because it depends on the current load on the system. In that case we could either map it to a different status code or still return HTTP 503 but provide a `Retry-After` header in the response indicating that this condition is only temporary (see [RFC2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)).\r\n\r\nI am bringing this up for discussion because due to #31767 we expect that Elasticsearch will exercise back-pressure in more situations instead of dying with `OutOfMemoryError`. Therefore clients should get a hint from the server how to handle this situation.","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
