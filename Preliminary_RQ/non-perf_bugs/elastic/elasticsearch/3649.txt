While upgrading to the latest 0.90 our acceptance tests failed because we were relying on the order of the output. By order I obviously mean the time, not counts.\n\nWe see this with a daily histogram, using the default transport (haven't checked with REST).\n\nThere is no guarantee in the docs about the histogram order, but they probably should say something about that. And, if the results are supposed to be ordered, then this is probably a bug worth fixing before a release...\n\nAnother thing we noticed (but that's not new) is that date points with zero values are omitted. Again, this wasn't obvious and should either be fixed (so buckets with zero values will still appear in results) or say so in the docs.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
