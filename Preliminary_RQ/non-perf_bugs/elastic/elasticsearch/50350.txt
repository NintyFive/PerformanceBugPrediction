I use es 6.8, and when I create index template, I cannot give type in template, because the it will use default type `_doc`.  But I found in Kibana 6.8,  if I omit the type, it will be an error.  What's worse, I use filebeat 6.8 and es 6.8,  and I will create template in es, it use `_doc` as type. But filebeat use `doc` as type, and user cannot change it.  My doubt is: since es use `_doc`( although maybe remove type in 8.0), why filebeat use `doc`, and user cannot change it to `_doc`?","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
