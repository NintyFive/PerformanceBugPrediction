If you add sniffing, you  will be able to sniff any node and you could use the `sniffHosts` option to sniff just client nodes from an external source.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have a dynamic pool of nodes (client only nodes) that when you add a new client node to a cluster, that node is added to the connection pool, but when you add master or data nodes, those aren't used, one of the ways that people would do that is by using an external Load Balancer.\r\n\r\nI think that it will be great for the Java REST client to be able to have a way to **sniff client-only** nodes.\r\n\r\nThe current Transport Client doesn't do that, and actually just retrieves a list of data nodes. The reason the transport client excludes non-data nodes is to avoid sending search traffic to master only nodes (from the docs).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
