The JVM [officially supports](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/envvars002.html) `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` for this purpose, but we [officially do not support that](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/13813) because it is broken on certain platforms. The environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` is supported in some projects (most notably Tomcat) but it is not officially supported and does not have widespread support (e.g., `mvn` does not support it). Notably, we [document `ES_JAVA_OPTS`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-service.html) but do not document `JAVA_OPTS`. There is no need to support both. Since we won't support `JAVA_TOOLS_OPTIONS`, and we do not document `JAVA_OPTS` but document `ES_JAVA_OPTS`, we should just remove support for `JAVA_OPTS` and keep `ES_JAVA_OPTS` only.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
