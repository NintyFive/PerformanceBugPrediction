Have we considered implementing smarter defaults when whole numbers are detected for settings in the meantime?  For example, there are settings out there that can be dangerous when mistakenly set to whole numbers (and we have seen this happen in production environments), things like zen discovery and fault detection timeouts, refresh and flush intervals, etc..  Instead of defaulting everything to milliseconds when whole numbers are detected, perhaps we can selectively default to milliseconds only for settings that makes sense?  For example, if refresh interval is set to a whole number and is <1000, ignore the setting and use the system default value (eg, 1s)  and write a warning to the log file indicating that we are falling back to the system default as a safety measure, etc..\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/135146480","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10466#issuecomment-135146480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10466","id":135146480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTE0NjQ4MA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-26T19:28:48Z","updated_at":"2015-08-26T19:28:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed via https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/11437\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
