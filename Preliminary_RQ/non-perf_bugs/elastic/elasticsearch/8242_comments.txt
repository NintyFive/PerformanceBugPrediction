I'll reply inline:\n\n> Hi @nik9000 ,\n> \n> I need more info to understand what happened:\n> \n> ```\n> clear any of their old generation\n> ```\n> \n> What do you mean exactly?\n\nIt was https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-6046 actually.  You can ignore the actual cause of the outage I think, my real question is about the weird \"received a join request for an existing node\" message.\n\n> ```\n> After restarting the full nodes I believe the cluster handshaking code had some trouble:\n> ```\n> \n> Do you mean you restarted the faulty nodes (10 of the 18) or all the nodes?\n\nSorry, yeah, the whole cluster.  All 31 nodes.\n\n> ```\n> The new node worked as expected and added the other nodes back.\n> ```\n> \n> What went wrong before?\n\nThe new nodes would just sit there claiming not to have a master connection.  Most http requests would time out as they were blocked on getting a master connection and the logs would mention sending requests to the master every once in a while.  The master logged what I quoted in the first post.  Restarting the master allowed the node to join the cluster.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/158678443","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8242#issuecomment-158678443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8242","id":158678443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODY3ODQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-21T20:14:06Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T20:14:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This reminds me of the old zombie nodes problem, that was solved a long time ago.
