But if you want to scale on text searches, then you need to index the same document on multiple nodes\n- actually if it would be possible to define multiple routing values for indexing, then I guess what I suggest would be completely possible\n- ok - i'm not an expert.  i do know that kimchy talked about sharding-on-terms as a failed experiment in the search world\n- you can see the video of that talk here: http://www.elasticsearch.org/videos/2011/08/09/road-to-a-distributed-searchengine-berlinbuzzwords.html\n- I wouldn't call Google as a failed experiment :-)\n- another thing that would be awesome is dynamic sharding: instead of specifying the number of shards, in some cases it could be interesting to specify maximum documents per shard. If limit is hit, a new shard is created...\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
