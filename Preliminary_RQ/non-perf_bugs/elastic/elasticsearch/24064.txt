The behaviour seems to be a bit unclear, so thats what this issue is about.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when using `interval` rounding of e.g. a day and providing extended bounds that are not rounded values, we round them down, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET index/test/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"size\": 0,\r\n  \"aggs\": {\r\n    \"my_agg\": {\r\n      \"date_histogram\": {\r\n        \"extended_bounds\": {\r\n          \"min\": \"2017-04-10T06:00:00Z\",\r\n          \"max\": \"2017-04-13T08:00:00Z\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"field\": \"date\",\r\n        \"interval\": \"1d\",\r\n        \"min_doc_count\": 0\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\"aggregations\": {\r\n    \"my_agg\": {\r\n      \"buckets\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"key_as_string\": \"2017-04-10T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n          \"key\": 1491782400000,\r\n          \"doc_count\": 0\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"key_as_string\": \"2017-04-11T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n          \"key\": 1491868800000,\r\n          \"doc_count\": 0\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"key_as_string\": \"2017-04-12T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n          \"key\": 1491955200000,\r\n          \"doc_count\": 1\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"key_as_string\": \"2017-04-13T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n          \"key\": 1492041600000,\r\n          \"doc_count\": 0\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo me that seems like a good behaviour because it leaves one edge buckets that overlaps the specified extended bound date. I furthermore think that any additional `offset` should shift the the buckets after rounding by a fixed amount (see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23776 for a current bug with this)","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
