Since then we had [146 build failures](https://build-stats.elastic.co/app/kibana#/discover?_g=(refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:'2020-09-23T22:00:00.000Z',mode:absolute,to:'2020-11-11T12:25:58.785Z'))&_a=(columns:!(_source),index:b646ed00-7efc-11e8-bf69-63c8ef516157,interval:auto,query:(language:lucene,query:'build.job-name:%22elastic%2Belasticsearch%2Bmaster%2Bg1gc%22%20AND%20process.status:%22FAILURE%22'),sort:!(process.time-start,desc))).\r\n\r\n**Failure excerpt**:\r\n\r\nThe build fails because `elasticsearch-keystore` terminates with exit code 1.\r\n\r\n```\r\n11:15:24 Execution failed for task ':qa:full-cluster-restart:v7.10.0#oldClusterTest'.\r\n11:15:24 > Process 'command './bin/elasticsearch-keystore'' finished with non-zero exit value 1\r\n11:15:24 \r\n11:15:24 * Try:\r\n11:15:24 Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

Program will exit.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it seems that `elasticsearch-keystore` picks up JVM flags for a Java version < 14 (including the JVM option `UseConcMarkSweepGC`) but actually runs with a Java version >= 14 (where [CMS has been removed](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/363)).
