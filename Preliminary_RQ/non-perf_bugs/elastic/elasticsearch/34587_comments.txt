For most queries, this isn't a problem because you can set  `default_field:*` and you'll get the same results, but span queries are tricky (in general!).  In your case, you should be able to use `copy_to` directives on the five fields you are interested in to create your own version of the `_all` field.  Or you may be able to produce the same sort of results using match queries and phrase slop.\r\n\r\nSeeing as this is a usage question, and we try and keep github for bugs or enhancements, I hope you don't mind that I close this issue.  If you want further help, we have discussion forums at https://discuss.elastic.co which is the best place to open an issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
