would actually be an acceptable solution for the majority of use cases.\nBut I have a list of dynamic index names, so maintaining some aliases would be quite hard, unless Elasticsearch can use some kind of patterns (regexes ?) in aliases definition which I could use to solve my problem.\n\nI agree that could sound weir to get a super long URL but I tend to think I am not the only one in this situation.\n\nIn case using aliases is not possible, do you think providing a configuration variable for netty's max_header_size (If I am not mistaken, this setting is available in netty)) would be an acceptable trade-off
