When a node leaves the cluster, shard copies of that node are currently marked as stale by removing their allocation ids from the active set in the cluster. For full cluster restarts, this can have the unwanted effect that only the last node holding a copy of the shard will be seen as non-stale. The other shard copies are not really stale though as long as no writes have happened on this shard copy. Shard copies should thus only be marked as stale (by the master in the cluster state) if other active shards have received acknowledged writes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
