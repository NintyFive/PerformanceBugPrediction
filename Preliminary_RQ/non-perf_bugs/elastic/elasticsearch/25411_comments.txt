While it is possible that your issue is caused by a bug in Elasticsearch, it is more effective for us and for you if the diagnosis takes place on the forum, and then a GitHub issue is raised if and when we confirm the nature of the bug.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue for now, but we can reopen it at a later date if we find that there is a bug that needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
