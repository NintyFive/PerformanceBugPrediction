Cluster settings are same for all the clusters.\n\nStrangely, only in one cluster (6 nodes); we are seeing that nodes are constantly failing to connect to Master node and rejoining back.\nIt happens all the time, even during idle period (when there are no read or writes).\n\nWe keep on seeing following exception in the logs **org.elasticsearch.transport.NodeNotConnectedException**\n\nBecause of this, Cluster has slowed down considerably. \n\nWe use kopf plugin for monitoring and it keeps popping up message - \"Loading cluster information is talking too long\"\n\nThere is not much data on individual nodes; almost 80% disk is free. CPU and Heap are doing fine. \n\nOnly difference between this cluster and other clusters, is the number of indices and shards. Other clusters have shards in hundreds and indices in double digit. \n\nBut this cluster has around 5000 shards and close to 250 indices.\n\nHas there been any change in 1.4.1 which can cause reconnection issues between nodes , if number of shards or indices are high ?\n\nAny help will be appreciated !\n\nPS. After rolling back the cluster to 1.3.2 version, things are back to normal.\n\nThanks,\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
