The `pattern` parameter accepts the regex expression (and flags the common ES level regex flags).\n\nIt also accepts `group` (defaults to -1), from teh docs:\n\ngroup=-1 (the default) is equivalent to \"split\".  In this case, the tokens will be equivalent to the output from (without empty tokens):String#split(java.lang.String)\n\nUsing group >= 0 selects the matching group as the token.  For example, if you have:\n\n```\npattern = \\'([^\\']+)\\'\ngroup = 0\n\ninput = aaa 'bbb' 'ccc'\n```\n\nthe output will be two tokens: 'bbb' and 'ccc' (including the ' marks).  With the same input but using group=1, the output would be: bbb and ccc (no ' marks).\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
