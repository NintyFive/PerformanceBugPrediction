However, using `elasticsearch-plugin remove` as part of the re-install/upgraded process returns a non-zero exit code if there are other plugins which still need to be upgraded.  This is problematic for automation (where, checking return codes is an extra good idea ;)) as iterating through a list of installed plugins to remove \"fails\" (exists non-zero) for all but the last plugin.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Upgrade an ElasticSearch node that has `discovery-ec2` and `repository-s3` installed from 5.x.y to 5.x.z (e.g. 5.4.0 to 5.4.3)\r\n 2. Run `elasticsearch-plugin remove repository-s3`\r\n 3. See warning output (this is fine, IMO) and non-zero return code","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
