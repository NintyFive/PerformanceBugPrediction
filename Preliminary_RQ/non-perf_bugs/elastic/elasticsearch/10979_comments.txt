the source, my current idea of implementing it is\n- Make SearchContext implementing an interface that adheres to `ContextHolder`, propagate to `ShardSearchRequest`, maybe just changing `DefaultSearchContext` is enough, needs to be checked\n- `ShardSearchRequest` also needs to implement that new interface, one of the two subclasses, `ShardSearchTransportRequest` already does, one needs to be extended `ShardSearchLocalRequest`\n- Both classes have access to the original `SearchRequest` and thus can copy the context\n- Make sure all of the above requests can make use of this infra\n- Search for possible more requests that need this\n- Copy headers need to be copied as well\n\nTricky: Testing
