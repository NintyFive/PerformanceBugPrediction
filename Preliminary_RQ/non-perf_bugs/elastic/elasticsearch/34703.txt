We also have a similar term (which is identical in meaning) call reads (`number_of_concurrent_reads`). We also have the generic `operations_received` and `total_transferred_bytes` and `last_requested_seq_no`.\r\n\r\nOn the write sides we have `bulk` (`number_of_successful_bulk_operations`, `number_of_failed_bulk_operations`) and `writes` (`number_of_concurrent_writes`, `number_of_queued_writes` <-- note the different semantics here).\r\n\r\nI think we should align our terminologies across the various places.
