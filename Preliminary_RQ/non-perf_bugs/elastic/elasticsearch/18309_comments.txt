I do not want this comment to distract from the issue though.\n\n> go back to using a 1GB heap by default\n\nI think we should go to 2g and I opened #18311. The work I did studying the impact of #16334 shows that at 2g we stop getting returns from increasing the heap. Namely: allocations in the TLABs, allocation rates and GC pause times do not change above 2g. \n\n> fix ES to not waste so much RAM.\n\nBut of course, we should do this too, but that's a larger effort. :smile:\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/218932341","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18309#issuecomment-218932341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18309","id":218932341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODkzMjM0MQ==","user":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T01:48:51Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T01:48:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am fine with your analysis.
