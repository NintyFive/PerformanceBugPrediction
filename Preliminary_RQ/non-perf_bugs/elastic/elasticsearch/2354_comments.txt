Data is dirty. Fact of life. So anything to help us out would be great.\n\n...And on that note I also don't agree with clintongormley's theory of \"make people fix their data.\" It's not always \"their\" data...And you can't predict what you might scrape from the internet AND the more schemaless databases and data sources we get the more we run into this issue. \n\nIn fact, people have commonly seen this EOF error with Twitter data. So when you work with a very popular data source / API (even if it's \"incorrect\" or \"bad practice\" - I'm not arguing that dirty data sucks), it's quite easy to see this error.\n\nYou can set the `ignore_malformed` setting in your index mapping, but it doesn't seem to help this situation. This is what I would expect though. While we can't reasonably convert data types back and forth...We can choose to ignore them. Otherwise, we have this failure going on which stops initial indexing and it's just bad.\n\nEVEN IF it was at the cost of skipping the entire document from being indexed...That would at least let us get past some of these errors which are typically edge cases to begin with (another reason why people \"just can't clean their data\").\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/56070778","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2354#issuecomment-56070778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2354","id":56070778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDcwNzc4","user":{"login":"ronsper","id":1288725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODg3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1288725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronsper","html_url":"https://github.com/ronsper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronsper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronsper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronsper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronsper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronsper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronsper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronsper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronsper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ronsper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-18T17:08:23Z","updated_at":"2014-09-18T17:08:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"A setting that would simply ignore these problem documents or a clear error message about what field is the actual problem would be so helpful.
