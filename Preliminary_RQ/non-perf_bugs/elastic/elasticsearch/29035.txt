However (at least for `BM25` and `classic`), it's happy to accept/acknowledge arbitrary parameters that may not exist:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT test\r\n{\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"index\" : {\r\n        \"similarity\" : {\r\n          \"default\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"BM25\",\r\n            \"foo\": \"bar\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nValidates even though there's obviously no `foo` parameter.  I had a situation where I had a typo of `k` instead of `k1` and I was thrown off for a little too long trying to figure out why my `k` value wasn't taking hold.  It'd be great if we could strictly validate and error out as early as possible.","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
