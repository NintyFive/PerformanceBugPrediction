We resist making changes to our codebase for OS that we do not support. This is because without CI infrastructure in place, we can not maintain that code.\r\n\r\nIn this specific case, you can workaround this issue by setting `ES_TMPDIR` inside the container (use the `ENV` directive). This will bypass the use of `mktemp`.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize: we can not guarantee that a future change will not break that workaround on Alpine Linux, but it stands today as an option.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
