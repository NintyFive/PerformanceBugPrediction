For Elasticsearch, this would be `org.elasticsearch...` (e.g. the logger tied to `Bootstrap` would be `org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Bootstrap`). However, Elasticsearch has long had a feature that drops the `org.elasticsearch` (so the logger for `Bootstrap` becomes `bootstrap.Bootstrap`).\n\nI suppose this is just to remove some verbosity, but it is inconsistent with logger names in other projects, and even inconsistent with other logger names that appear in our plugins (for example, in the AWS SDK based plugins we do not drop `com.amazonaws`). We do modify `org.jboss.netty` to `netty3` and `io.netty` to just `netty`, but we do not do this for any other loggers that get exposed.\n\nIt causes another problem though: there is no way to set the logger level for only the Elasticsearch packages. That is, if you want to set the logger level to trace for Elasticsearch, then this means setting the root logger level which means picking up everything else (e.g., Netty) even if you don't want that.\n\nThe question here is, should we remove this feature and just always require the `org.elasticsearch` prefix? Note that this should not impact the ability to drop the `org.elasticsearch` prefix when the package name is logged as part of the log format, we can control that separately.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
