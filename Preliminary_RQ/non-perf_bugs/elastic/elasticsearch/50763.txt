We observed this happening upgrading from `7.1.0` to `7.5.0` and also from `7.1.0` to `7.1.1` . This appears to be the same issue as #25350.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce,  start up a `7.1.0` cluster, and apply the following settings:\r\n```\r\nPUT /i\r\n{\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"index\": {\r\n      \"similarity\": {\r\n        \"my_similarity\": {\r\n          \"after_effect\": \"l\",\r\n          \"basic_model\": \"g\",\r\n          \"normalization\": \"h2\",\r\n          \"normalization.h2.c\": \"3.0\",\r\n          \"type\": \"DFR\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen attempt to upgrade that cluster.
