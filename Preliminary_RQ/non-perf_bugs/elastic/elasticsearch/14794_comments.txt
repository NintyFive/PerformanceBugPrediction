Index a document with `\"attachment\":\"BASE64 ENCODED\"`\n3. This is matching the `string` type so we apply the mapping\n\nDo the same thing but index a document like:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"attachment\": {\n    \"_content\": \"BASE64\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere the attachment field is now detected as an `object` not as a `string` anymore. So the dynamic mapping you defined can not be applied.\n\nI don't think we can fix that. May be we can document that if you are using a dynamic template with a attachment field, you won't be able to use `_content` and other metadata fields. In that case I would not use a dynamic template.\n\nI mean that in your example you have only one field named `my_attachment`, right? Is your intention to have an infinite number of such fields? \n\nIf not, may be using an index template with a mapping which declares explicitly `my_attachment` as an attachment field would be better.\n\nAdding label `docs` to this
