Perhaps I want back all of the indices with `@timestamp` fields between 2014-01-01 and 2015-01-01:\n\n```\ncurl -XGET \"http://localhost:9200/_field_stats?fields=@timestamp&min=2014-01-01&max=2015-01-01\"\n```\n\nThe above is probably not the right syntax since it would only allow for a single field. I'm not sure if we want a post body here or some other syntax?\n\nThis would be incredibly useful for Kibana and let us get rid of some serious bugs that occur for users with large numbers of indices. In fact, we could entirely get rid of our notion of timestamped indices as we'd be able to reliably sort an index list based on time. Users would only need to know their wildcard pattern! It would also allow for weird indexing strategies where maybe they're indexing weekly at one point and they need to step up to daily, something that isn't currently possible. Heck, you wouldn't even need timestamped indices, you could just increase a counter!\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
