Each ingest node periodically polls the .ingest index in the background and if there are changes it updates the in-memory representation of the pipelines.\n\nIf changes made to a pipeline via the put pipeline api would also trigger that all ingest nodes update their pipelines then things becomes much more predictable. This process isn't heavy, so I think we shouldn't be concerned about performance if we trigger a reload after each call the put pipeline api.\n\nThis should make using node ingest easier and also would make testing easier. (no need to wrap assertions inside assertBusy(...) blocks).\n\nIf we were to add an internal pipeline refresh api then the put and delete pipeline apis would you invoke that after each modification. The internal refresh api should trigger a reload of all ingest nodes and return when all the reloads have been completed.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
