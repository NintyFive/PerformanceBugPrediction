Dynamic templates are currently not executed for static mappings. It would be great to have static mappings with something like static templates that would allow to provide mapping information for certain groups of fields not in the static mapping. Dynamic mappings are not always appropriate here as they would automatically pick up all fields dynamically whereas I would only like to include a subset of the fields (e.g. a group of fields that adhere to a certain naming scheme).\n\nThe group discussion for this request can be found [here](http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Dynamic-Templates-amp-Static-Mappings-td2319851.html)\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
