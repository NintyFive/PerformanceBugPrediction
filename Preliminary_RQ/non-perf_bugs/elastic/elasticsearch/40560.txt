currently duplicate glossary terms for Elasticsearch in two places:\r\n\r\n- [Elasticsearch Reference glossary](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html)\r\n- [Elastic Stack Glossary](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-glossary/current/index.html)\r\n\r\nPer @lcawl's suggestion in elastic/stack-docs#34, we should consolidate terms in the Elastic Stack Glossary and use `include::` to pull them in.\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n@lcawl pointed out that this will create a dependency between the ES Reference and the Elastic Stack glossary.\r\n\r\nA non-exhaustive list of options to address the dependency:\r\n- Update the [Doc Build aliases](https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/doc_build_aliases.sh) to explicitly list the stack-docs repo as a resource.\r\n- Relocate the Elastic Stack glossary to the /elastic/docs repo.\r\n\r\n@nik9000 let me know if you have any input on the preferred approach.","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
