Often we have to do lots of independent searches in a batch and the round-trip latency waiting for each one to complete costs us an awful lot of time. It would improve our throughput enormously if we could send say 1000 searches in a single batch and not have the cluster reject them all. So basically something like the bulk API but for search.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/220563793","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17926#issuecomment-220563793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17926","id":220563793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDU2Mzc5Mw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T09:50:27Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T09:50:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We should add a concurrency parameter to limit the number of searches from an msearch that are run in parallel.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
