We need unbounded queues for thread pools like GENERIC (and until we change a couple of things, also MANAGEMENT). For the fixed type ones we might get away with removing the -1 (agreed it doesn't buy us anything) but it would not result in more safety - people can still set it to something extremely high. Not sure it's worth the inconsistency.
