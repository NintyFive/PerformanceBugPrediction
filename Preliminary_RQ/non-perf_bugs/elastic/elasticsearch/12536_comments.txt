It will simply deploy a SNAPSHOT version which does not hurt. \n\nIMO it would be better to rename elasticsearch artifact to elasticsearch-core and for distribution modules use elasticsearch as artifact id. So all defaults should be good.\n\nNot sure what would be the impact of this.\n\nIIRC I tried to use elasticsearch as the artifactId in distribution modules but it was not possible without renaming core module (circular dependency). But I'm AFK and can't really test this ATM. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/127534690","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12536#issuecomment-127534690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12536","id":127534690,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzUzNDY5MA==","user":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-04T09:09:53Z","updated_at":"2015-08-04T09:09:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Removed blocker.
