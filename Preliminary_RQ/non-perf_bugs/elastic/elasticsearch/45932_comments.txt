I've also noticed that the stack trace reported sometimes happens during the test execution, but test passes fine. I've also checked other builds for this error occurrence and this is the only one. Given that it's not reproducible and has happened just once, I suggest to close it and reopen if it occurs in the future.\r\nFor the second issue reported by @bizybot, I'm creating a separate ticket - the reason for the failure is clear, but we won't fix it in older versions.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
