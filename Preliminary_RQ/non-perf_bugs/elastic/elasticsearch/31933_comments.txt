The `es.enforce.bootstrap.checks` option is used to enable them when they are disabled due to Elasticsearch not detecting that it is being used in production (single node, only reachable through `localhost` or using single-node discovery).\r\n\r\nIn the paragraphs above the documentation, it mentions the settings `http.host` and `transport.host` as well as links to their modules explaining those settings. It also has the `discovery.type` setting documented there with the `single-node` option listed. These are options in your configuration file.\r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions for clarifying this documentation further, pull requests are very much welcome from our community.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/403908967","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31933#issuecomment-403908967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31933","id":403908967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzkwODk2Nw==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-10T17:47:01Z","updated_at":"2018-07-10T17:47:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/403909290","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31933#issuecomment-403909290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31933","id":403909290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzkwOTI5MA==","user":{"login":"jbaiera","id":875779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/875779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera","html_url":"https://github.com/jbaiera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-10T17:48:01Z","updated_at":"2018-07-10T17:48:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this out for now.
