We've looked into this functionality a number of times before:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6769#issuecomment-263007228\r\n- https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27315#issuecomment-343313693\r\n- https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/3278#issuecomment-289752622\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the proposed implementations only work for small datasets, so we won't be adding this to Elasticsearch. The best approach is to do this client-side as you are. You may find things like the [multi-search API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-multi-search.html) to be useful if you want to reduce the number of round-trips to your cluster.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
