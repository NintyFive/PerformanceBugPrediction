That said, we are exploring alternative ways to compute aggregations which might allow to return results in a streaming fashion. However, this is something that we are only starting exploring now, no single line of code has been written and it's not even clear what the API should look like so it is going to take time before we expose something like this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/292880164","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23890#issuecomment-292880164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23890","id":292880164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Mjg4MDE2NA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-10T08:15:20Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T08:15:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing for now, we'll open a new issue if/when we have something along the lines of what I described in my previous message.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
