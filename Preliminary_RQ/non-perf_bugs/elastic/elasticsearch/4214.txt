I created a situation where i am reading from a large file (with individual json objects) and forming separate Bulkrequests.  It so happens that the source file has a large number of json records - 2976800 to be precise.  I increased my heap settings to ensure that the program and also elasticsearch does not run out of memory.  \n\n On execution, the java program reaches the below line and does not proceed further\n                BulkResponse bulkResponse = bulkRequest.execute().actionGet();\n\nHowever when i queried the _count endpoint for that index, i already see that it has indexed 2967800 records.  Here's the output of _count endpoint\n\n{\n  \"count\" : 2976800,\n  \"_shards\" : {\n    \"total\" : 10,\n    \"successful\" : 10,\n    \"failed\" : 0\n  }\n\nDoes the above mean that the documents have already been indexed?  If so, why does  bulkRequest.execute().actionGet() not return.  I looked into some older issues; looks like it might be related to Issue #1839\n\n  I understand i can probably chunk my requests using BulkProcessor.  I am going to try that; just wanted to check if there is some issue with the base BulkRequest.execute()\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
