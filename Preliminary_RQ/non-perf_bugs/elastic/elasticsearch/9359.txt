It also tends to work well if there's a pattern to your index names.\n\nHowever, where index names aren't named consistently, which is pretty common, then it's a hassle to whitelist them all. It also may be difficult to do with plugins.\n\nI think that that it would make a lot of sense to have an additional whitelist option that allows users to whitelist any template-created index, like `action.auto_create_index_from_template: true` that you can use _if_ disabling normal auto creation. This would allow any index created by templates to be created even if they're not explicitly listed in `action.auto_create_index`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
