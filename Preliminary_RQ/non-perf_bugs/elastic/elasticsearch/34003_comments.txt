I am building a system to support searching school directory. We are trying to find whether Elasticsearch supports a query to do both fuzzy and prefix match between the searching term and every term in the index. I know Elasticsearch, currently, supports `Autocomplete suggester`. However, this feature is to implement functionality like \"autocomplete\". I would like to support such a feature for each term (behave like full prefix fuzzy search).\r\n\r\nFor detail, I also post this question to Elastic discussion forum:\r\n\r\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/t/implement-full-text-fuzzy-prefix-search-in-elastic-search/158990","performed_via_github_app":null}]
