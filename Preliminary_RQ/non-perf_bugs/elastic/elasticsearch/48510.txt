Its features will be a superset of what is available in _platinum_.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nThis is the new format for the Stack _enterprise_ license.\r\nNothing will change for other Stack licenses, like _platinum_ or _gold_.\r\n\r\n- the `type` field gets a new value, `enterprise`\r\n- a new field named `max_resource_units` is introduced, with a numeric value\r\n- the `max_nodes` field that is present in other Stack licenses is not part of this license type\r\n- the `signature` field covers the `max_resource_units` value\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  \"license\": { \r\n    \"uid\": \"bf610b02-470e-d453-0b75-d2f7dfead89f\",\r\n    \"type\": \"enterprise\",\r\n    \"issue_date_in_millis\": 1576000000000,\r\n    \"start_date_in_millis\": 1576000000000,\r\n    \"expiry_date_in_millis\": 1590000000000,\r\n    \"max_resource_units\": 100,\r\n    \"issued_to\": \"Elastic - INTERNAL\",\r\n    \"issuer\": \"Fabio Busatto\",\r\n    \"signature\": \"AAAA...xyz\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 7.x, the [Get license API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/get-license.html) will return a backward compatible platinum license even if an enterprise license is installed, unless `accept_enterprise=true` is passed to the request. This option will change the behavior and the API will return the enterprise license instead.\r\n\r\nIn 8.0, the [Get license API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/get-license.html) will return the enterprise license by default, and the `accept_enterprise` option will be deprecated.","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
