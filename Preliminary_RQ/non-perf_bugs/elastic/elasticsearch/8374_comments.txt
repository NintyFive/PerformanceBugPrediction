NEST always expands to the most elaborate form a construct accepts. i.e NEST will always send:\n\n```\n{\n    \"term\" : { \"user\" : { \"value\" : \"kimchy\" } }\n}\n```\n\nover \n\n```\n{\n    \"term\" : { \"user\" : \"value\" }\n}\n```\n\nEven if the NEST API itself allows you to be terser.\n\nWe (.NET team) spent some time internally a couple of weeks ago trying to generate and refine a `json schema draft 4` spec for all the requests and responses and its individual components but sadly found that some constructs simply cannot be expressed strictly enough in json schema i.e:\n\n```\n{\n    \"term\" : { \"user\" : \"kimchy\" }\n}\n```\n\n`user` being a variable property name wreaks havoc on trying to lock it down in a schema. Json schema does allow for something like [patternProperties](http://jsonary.com/documentation/json-schema/?section=keywords/Object%20validation#keywords/Object%20validation/02%20-%20patternProperties) but you can not make them mandatory or limit the number of occurrences.\n\nSo its back to the drawing board on this for now. The idea i've been floating now is to identify all places that read and accept json and write out all valid objects it can read / write post that up somewhere and go from there (reference implementations of the types in various languages).\n\nSuggestions are much welcomed!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62154331","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8374#issuecomment-62154331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8374","id":62154331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTU0MzMx","user":{"login":"ppurang","id":326738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjczOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/326738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppurang","html_url":"https://github.com/ppurang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppurang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppurang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppurang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppurang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppurang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppurang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppurang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppurang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppurang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-07T14:49:52Z","updated_at":"2014-11-07T14:49:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1
