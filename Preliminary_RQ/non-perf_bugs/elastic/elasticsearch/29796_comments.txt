That is, we could run a painless/terms agg on `params._source['fieldname']` to see if it returns values that aren't \"true\" or \"false\" which would indicate a problem.  This heuristic would likely be the case for all the internal indices and would have an advantage of also checking user generated indices for problems, but if there are a lot of smaller user-generated indices, it could add significantly to the time.  It also wouldn't help with \"big\" indices.  We could go a step further potentially by allowing them to run a very slow/expensive query on bigger indices if they really want to.\r\n- We could simply ignore the internal indices that we know of either in the UI or in the deprecation API.  I doubt the UI has any greater sense for what's internal vs not?\r\n- The warning message could use a cleanup if we don't change the logic IMO.  I assume the link goes through to the breaking changes docs, and if I were reading this warning and then read the breaking changes doc, I'd think \"oh, they're linking me there because I've got one of these field values with 'on' or 'off' or 1 or 0\" not \"I've got a boolean field mapping.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we can realistically fix any of these before 5.6.0 though.

I feel that suppressing output from the deprecations API may not be a good experience.

So here, people can see, nothing needs to be done, but they should just be aware of the change.\r\n\r\nI rather think this is not a problem concerned with internal indices vs user-managed ones, but a matter of messaging. The only issues that need to be resolved are the red ones, but that doesn't mean we will hide green, blue, and yellow issues. They should all be known. At least that's my feeling on it. I also feel that we should treat our users as knowledgeable people and give them more information rather than less.
