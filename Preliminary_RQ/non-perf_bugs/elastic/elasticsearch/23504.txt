If I execute\r\n```\r\nGET idx/child/_search\r\n{\r\n  query: {\r\n    bool: {\r\n      must_not: {\r\n        has_parent: {\r\n          parent_type: \"parent\",\r\n          query: {\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI get all existing children.

Regardless of how you interpret an empty `query` block within `has_parent` this is plain non-sense. Every child has a single parent that cannot _both_ satisfy and not satisfy a predicate at the same time.","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
