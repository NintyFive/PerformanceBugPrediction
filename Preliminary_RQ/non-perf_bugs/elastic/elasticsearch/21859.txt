To get the document as part of a pipeline inline script you would use `ctx`. Previously in transforms it was `ctx._source`.\r\n2. To get the document as part of an update by query script you would use `ctx._source`. This hasn't changed since the previous versions.\r\n3. Somewhat related, if you want to access source doc and properties in a pipeline processor it (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/accessing-data-in-pipelines.html) You just use `_source` or the property name.\r\n4. For combining fields / accessing doc values you would use `total += doc['goals'][i];` (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/modules-scripting-painless.html#_accessing_doc_values_from_painless).\r\n\r\nFor the **love of PAINLESS** can we please standardize on one common name to get the source doc. This is just out of hand and very unintuitive. I prefer just to have `doc` be the common variable across all of these.","closed_by":{"login":"stu-elastic","id":24232742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjMyNzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24232742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic","html_url":"https://github.com/stu-elastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
