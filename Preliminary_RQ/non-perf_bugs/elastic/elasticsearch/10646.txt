Instead it would be more efficient to return a TermQuery wrapped in a ConstantScoreQuery. \n\nAs well as providing a performance improvement this change will lay the foundations for https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10628 which will add an option to use the TermQueries, unwrapped, to allow numeric fields to make use of the usual Lucene ranking behaviour (IDF + norms).\n","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
