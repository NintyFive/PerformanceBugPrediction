Please ask questions like these in the [Elasticsearch forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) instead. Thank you!\r\n\r\nAs a hint: I guess Elasticsearch is terminating due to some problem that is specific to your machine. You should not double-click on the `.bat` file but instead open a terminal (`cmd.exe`) and start the `elasticsearch.bat` file from there. By doing it this way you should be able to see the error.
