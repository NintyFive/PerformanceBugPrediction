version**: 5.0.0-alpha1\n\n**JVM version**: Oracle JDK 1.8.0_77-b03\n\n**OS version**: SLES 11SP4\n\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\n\n`elasticsearch 5.0.0-alpha1` rpm package is not installable on SLES11SP4. `rpm -i` fails complaining about the header and exits with a segmentation fault.\nTangentially to this, `gradle checkSles11` fails trying to install the created elasticsearch package.\nNote that `elasticsearch-2.0.0.0.rpm` installs without problems.\n\nExpected behavior is that `elasticsearch-5.0.0*.rpm` should be installable on SLES 11SP4 via `rpm` or `zypper`\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. clone [my forked branch](https://github.com/dliappis/elasticsearch/tree/add_sles11_support) containing the sles-11 vagrant additions\n2. `gradle prepareTestRoot`\n3. `vagrant up sles-11 && vagrant ssh sles-11`\n4. `cd $TESTROOT`\n5. `sudo bats $BATS/*_rpm_*.bats`\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n1.
