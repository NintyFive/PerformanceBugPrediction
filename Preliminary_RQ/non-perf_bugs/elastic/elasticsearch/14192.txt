As a result, they are not builders anymore although we kept the `Builder` suffix to avoid making too many changes at the same time and dealing with merge conflicts. Now that all queries are refactored and everything is in master, it is time to settle on new naming and rename them all. One tricky aspect could be that removing the `Builder` suffix would result in many cases to the same class name as the corresponding lucene query, which sits though in another package. Shall we just remove the suffix or can anybody come up with some better name convention for our own query objects? :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
