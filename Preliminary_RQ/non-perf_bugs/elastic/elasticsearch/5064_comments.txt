For pure \"site\" plugins such as head, updating can be done without issues, but in cases of plugins with Java classes, the process would not be possible because the classes have already been loaded and a restart would be required (although plugins can now have their own class loader, but dealing with reloading classes is too much of a pain).\n\nThere is no plugin state recorded in Elasticsearch AFAIK, so it probably cannot differentiate if an update request is for a \"site\" plugin or not.
