The problem with this approach is in query time where you have to choose one analyzer. Using one analyzer to query a field parsed with many languages will probably not give you want and cause surprising results. You are better off indeed to have a field variant per language ala `field_en`, `field_de` and using [mapping transform](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-transform.html#mapping-transform) to put the original field in one of these based on the content of `lang`. You can then query all of the language fields (or just some) at query time.\n\nPS - as this is not really an issue but a question, I would like to ask to use the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elasticsearch) instead. Closing this for now.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
