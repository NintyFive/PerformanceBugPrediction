version**: 5.4.1\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: []\r\n\r\n**JVM version**: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_131-8u131-b11-1~bpo8+1-b11)\r\n\r\n**OS version**: Linux fs-deb 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.43-2 (2017-04-30) x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\nI have this scheme:\r\n5 x Filebeats (Windows 10) -> Logstash (5.4.1) -> Elasticsearch (5.4.1) -> Kibana (5.4.1)\r\nLogstach, Elasticsearch and Kibana are on the same linux machine (16Gb RAM)\r\nThe only changes I did in elastic settings are:\r\n```\r\n-Xms8g\r\n-Xmx8g\r\n```\r\n(I made this change not in the beginning but later after some problem googling)\r\nand \r\n`network.host: 0.0.0.0`\r\n\r\nVery often I get elasticsearch crashes with these logs:\r\n\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/kDHE23XS\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/cJ0Z0qqt\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/PTGM9L20\r\n\r\nSometimes elasticsearch service just stops with ABORT like described [here](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/es-node-killed-with-6-abrt-how-to-find-out-why-and-by-whom/24108/2) \r\n\r\nLogstash

find something interesting with cpu or memory, but I didn't see any weird behaviour.","closed_by":{"login":"Gnitry","id":3641011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDEwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3641011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnitry","html_url":"https://github.com/Gnitry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnitry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnitry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnitry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnitry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnitry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnitry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnitry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnitry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gnitry/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
