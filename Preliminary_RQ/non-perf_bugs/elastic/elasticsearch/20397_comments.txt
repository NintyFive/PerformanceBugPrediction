DOS isn't something we can really protect against (and there are already numerous other ways to do this on an open cluster, for example with nasty prefix queries).\n\nAs far as asserts or other debugging features, I don't think these should be flags at all. Instead, they should not be available in scripts for real apis (eg in score scripts etc), but we should have an api similar to _analyze where you can run a script once with some given input (and that input would depend on which context it is expected to be run in, for example, with a score script, you would have to pass in the doc variable essentially).  In this api, we can always have debugging features available (eg asserts, logging, whatever).  \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/246436409","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20397#issuecomment-246436409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20397","id":246436409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjQzNjQwOQ==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-12T18:03:45Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T18:03:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> DOS isn't something we can really protect against (and there are already numerous other ways to do this on an open cluster, for example with nasty prefix queries).\n\nI think the goal of issues like this one are to do more to protect against it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/246441284","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20397#issuecomment-246441284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20397","id":246441284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjQ0MTI4NA==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-12T18:19:04Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T18:19:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I think the goal of issues like this one are to do more to protect against it.\n\nI disagree.
