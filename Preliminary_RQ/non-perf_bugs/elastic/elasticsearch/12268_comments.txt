Unfortunately it is not easily fixable - it is a project we're planning on tackling in the 2.x series (see #6732 for more).\n\nThe way to fix it is to reset this setting to its default value (which you have to set explicitly) as in:\n\n```\nPUT _cluster/settings\n{\n  \"persistent\": {\n    \"cluster\": {\n      \"routing\": {\n        \"allocation\": {\n          \"enable\": \"all\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt'll remain in the cluster settings though - there's currently no way to delete settings.\n\nClosing in favour of #6732\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
