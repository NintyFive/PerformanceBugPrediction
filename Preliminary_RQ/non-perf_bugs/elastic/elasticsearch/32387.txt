`x-pack/qa/kerberos-tests` project has the following flow:\r\n\r\nIt generated source (`generatedResources`) in the `copyKeytabToGeneratedResources` task\r\n```\r\nproject.sourceSets.test.output.dir(generatedResources, builtBy: copyKeytabToGeneratedResources)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat task depends on `krb5AddPrincipals`\r\n```\r\ntask copyKeytabToGeneratedResources(type: Copy) {\r\n    Path peppaKeytab = project(':test:fixtures:krb5kdc-fixture').buildDir.toPath().resolve(\"keytabs\").resolve(\"peppa.keytab\").toAbsolutePath()\r\n    from peppaKeytab;\r\n    into generatedResources\r\n    dependsOn krb5AddPrincipals\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich in turn depends on `krb5kdcFixture`\r\n```\r\nask krb5AddPrincipals { dependsOn krb5kdcFixture }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich provisions and brings up a vagrant box:\r\n```\r\ntask krb5kdcFixture(type: org.elasticsearch.gradle.test.VagrantFixture) {\r\n    command 'up'\r\n    args '--provision', '--provider', 'virtualbox'\r\n    boxName box\r\n    environmentVars vagrantEnvVars\r\n    dependsOn krb5kdcUpdate\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTha is, building the _source_ for this project requires bringing up a vagrant box, which means it adds a massive weight (and wait) to simple tasks like `precommit`.\r\n\r\nWe either need to\r\n1. be able to get keytab file without provisioning the vagrant box. For example this is what we do for the IDP cert in saml-idp-tests (see `copyIdpCertificate`), it used to be generated inside vagrant, but is now a static file in the project itself.\r\n2. only copy the keytab from the vagrant box when running the `integTestCluster`. This is how the saml-idp-tests get the `idp-metadata.xml` file from the vagrant box.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bizybot","id":902768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjc2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/902768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot","html_url":"https://github.com/bizybot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
