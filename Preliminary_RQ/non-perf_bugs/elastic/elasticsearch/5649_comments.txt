I can see an instance in our app where both .percolate and .percolator are referenced in creating a type but I don't ever think the code to create the .percolate type is actually called. \n\nOn checking whether the types exist I found the following:\n\n$ curl -i -XHEAD localhost:9200/insight/.percolate\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n\n$ curl -i -XHEAD localhost:9200/insight/.percolator\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nI've made changes to remove all references to .percolate so i'll close this and re-open if I still see the warning.
