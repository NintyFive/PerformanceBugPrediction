Until this point everything is running nice and smooth. i.e. a prompt is asking me to authenticate myself after calling \"host:9200\" and after inserting one of my new users i can see the status-site of ES.\n\nWith that working i wanted to start up a kibana3 instance running on the same host as ES does. I change one line in the \"kibana.js\":\n\n```\nelasticsearch: {server: \"http://host:9200\", withCredentials: true}\n```\n\nand also added these three lines to my \"elasticsearch.yml\":\n\n```\nhttp.cors.enabled: true\nhttp.cors.allow-origin: \"http://host:80/kibana\"\nhttp.cors.allow-credentials: true\n```\n\nBut when i open my Kibana-Webpage it tells me that the \"connection failed\":\n\n_Possibility #1: Your elasticsearch server is down or unreachable\nThis can be caused by a network outage, or a failure of the Elasticsearch process. If you have recently run a query that required a terms facet to be executed it is possible the process has run out of memory and stopped. Be sure to check your Elasticsearch logs for any sign of memory pressure.\nPossibility #2: You are running Elasticsearch 1.4 or higher\nElasticsearch 1.4 ships with a security setting that prevents Kibana from connecting. You will need to set the following in your elasticsearch.yml:\nhttp.cors.enabled: true\nhttp.cors.allow-origin to the correct protocol, hostname, and port (if not 80) that your access Kibana from. Note that if you are running Kibana in a sub-url, you should exclude the sub-url path and only include the protocol, hostname and port. For example, http://mycompany.com:8080, not http://mycompany.com:8080/kibana.\nClick back, or the home button, when you have resolved the connection issue_\n\nAsked already in the Mailling bust nobody could help mi. What did i do wrong? Thanks for any suggestions!\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
