The parameter should rather be called `details` (see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/indices/recovery/RecoveryState.java#L918), although it's no longer accepted by the recovery API since we introduced parameters validation. Also the `detailed` flag is transported to the response, without being serialized nor printed out, where it should be removed.\r\n\r\nWe should make this work, by ~~either accepting the `details` param instead and updating docs and spec or~~ modifying `RecoveryState` to look for `detailed` instead of `details`. The detailed flag though doesn't need to be part of the response, and does not need to be part of the request either, given that `RestRequest` is provided as `Params` argument to the `toXContent` method.","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
