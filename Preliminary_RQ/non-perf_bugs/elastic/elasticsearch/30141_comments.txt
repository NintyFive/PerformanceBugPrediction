And adding a code path where we do not validate the node-id seems pretty straightforward. But I want to check, there is a public method `connectedNodes` which supposedly returns the discovery nodes that are currently connected.

It returns the data populated from the `LivenessResponse`, even though there is no guarantee (when using the load balancer) that requests will go to that node.\r\n\r\nAre we okay with this?
