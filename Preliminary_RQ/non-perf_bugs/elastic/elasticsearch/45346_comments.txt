However, I'm hesitant to update any of the existing examples.\r\n\r\nIt seems that `throttle_period` is likely a better default for most users. But I'm not that experienced with Watcher and its use cases. If you feel strongly that `throttle_period_in_millis` should be included in an example, I can look at maybe adding a new one.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
