Either lowering the number of replicas or adding more nodes will solve the problem.\n\nI am closing this, would you mind continuing this discussion on the mailing list if you have any further question? Thanks!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/328318114","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9113#issuecomment-328318114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9113","id":328318114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODMxODExNA==","user":{"login":"soaryang","id":7556169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTYxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7556169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaryang","html_url":"https://github.com/soaryang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaryang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaryang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaryang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaryang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaryang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaryang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaryang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaryang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaryang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-10T03:58:41Z","updated_at":"2017-09-10T03:58:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @javanna \r\nCould tell me what is your mail.I want to ask you one question.Thanks!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
