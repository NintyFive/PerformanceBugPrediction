The performance is as much as [4x better](https://benchmarks-old.elastic.co/index.html#search_qps_scripts) than groovy for the same script. There have also been numerous changes in #17992 to allow existing groovy scripts to work out of the box.\n\nGroovy is on its way out. We should change the default scripting language to painless for 5.0, so that we can at least move groovy to a plugin for 5.0 or 6.0. Users would still be able to change back, just as they could with mvel when we made the switch to groovy.\n\nI've marked this issue as breaking, but I expect the vast majority of groovy scripts to just work in painless.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
