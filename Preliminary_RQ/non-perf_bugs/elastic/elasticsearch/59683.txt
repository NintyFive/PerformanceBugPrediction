The node.remote_cluster_client setting can be set to false (defaults to true) to prevent certain nodes from connecting to remote clusters. Remote cluster requests must be sent to a node that is allowed to act as a cross-cluster client.\r\n```\r\nWhen configure some nodes, like data node, set `node.remote_cluster_client` to `false` in 7.8 or set `cluster.remote.connect` to `false`  in 7.3, the remote clusters was not working as expected, and if you run query against the remote cluster, it will randomly get `index_not_found_exception`, as below:\r\n![CCS-roundrobin-index-not-found](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64487/87624429-58432180-c75a-11ea-9433-962a553e652a.gif)\r\n\r\nseems those remote requests are still routing to these nodes and this doesn't work as expected, these nodes should be skipped i guess.\r\n\r\nBut if you check the log, it says `password authentication failed for elastic`,\r\n<img width=\"752\" alt=\"Jietu20200714-213301\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64487/87624473-77da4a00-c75a-11ea-9535-972d6994fa22.png\">\r\n\r\nAnd also this issue happens in proxy mode as well.\r\n\r\nAnother side effect on Kibana:\r\n- Monitoring page refused to display, says permission error.\r\n- Remote clusters page lost/disappear the data.","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
