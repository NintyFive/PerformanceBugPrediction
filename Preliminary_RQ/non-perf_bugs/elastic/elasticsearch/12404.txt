ran into an issue with ES not picking up limits configuration when installing using apt-get.\n\nSystem descrtiption:\nDebian8 with openJDK:\n\n```\njava version \"1.7.0_79\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.5.5) (7u79-2.5.5-1~deb8u1)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.79-b02, mixed mode)\n```\n\nI've configured /etc/deafult/elasticsearch to support mlock.all and increased the nofile for the ES user, but even doing so, when cURL-ed `es:9200/_nodes/process?pretty`, I got mlock.all false and max_file_descriptors=65K (where I set it to 262144).\n\nAfter digging throughout the system and with the community, I scanned again `/etc/default/elasticsearch` and found a pointer to `/usr/lib/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service`.\n\nAfter modifying `LimitNOFILE=262144` and `LimitMEMLOCK=infinity` and restarting ES, mlock.all was true and max_file_descriptors was set to 262144.\n\nIs this the way it intended to be used? if so, should be documented more explicitly on ES site.\nIf not, what should be done (ontop of [this](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/setup-service.html)) in order to enable mlock.all and increase the max_file_descriptors ?\n\nI'll be happy to provide additional info if needed.\n\nThanks,\nYarden\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
