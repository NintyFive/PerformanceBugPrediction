We have tests with java 8 with all our support jdk vendors so it is likely an issue with your java vendor.\r\nAdditionally, it is better to start discussions about possible bugs on our forums. We try to keep github reserved for feature requests and confirmed bug reports so I'd be happy to help in the [discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/t). Please start a new topic explaining the java version you used as well as how you installed it and where it comes from.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
