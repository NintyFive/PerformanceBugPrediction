(Simple analyzer).\r\nMapping looks like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"mappings\":{\r\n\t\t\"myType\":{\r\n\t\t\t\"properties\":{\r\n\t\t\t\t\"suggest\":{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"completion\"\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nIndex a document: \r\nPost request: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n     'suggest': {\r\n        'input': ['One', 'Two']\r\n     }\r\n }\r\n```\r\nUsing a bulk request:\r\n```\r\n{ 'create': { '_index':'myIndex' , '_type':'myType', '_id': '0'}}\r\n{'suggest' : { 'input': ['One','Two'] } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use the C# nest api with a SuggestRequest. (as stated in the docs:\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/current/suggest-usage.html  )\r\n\r\nRelated stackoverflow topic:\r\n https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48193721/empty-value-generates-mapper-parsing-exception-for-elasticsearch-completion-sugg\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I've followed the stack trace to reach into 2 pages:\r\nThe SuggestField in Lucene which throws:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/lucene/suggest/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/suggest/document/SuggestField.java\r\nLine: 89\r\n\r\nAnd the code in elastic: \r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/mapper/CompletionFieldMapper.java \r\nLine 465\r\n\r\nThe indexing method was by your docs: \r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/search-suggesters-completion.html\r\n\r\nI tried different ways of tackling it with no luck. \r\nI enursed the data I send is not empty (Has values and the array is not empty). \r\n\r\nThanks!
