It was parsed but later never used when creating the internal SortField, since the \"_score\" field is always present. For that reason it was also removed from parsing for \"_score\" in 5.x but still exists for other field sorts. It probably wasn't marked as breaking because it didn't work for \"_score\" and was also only documented for missing field values. It is save to ommit. Hope this helps, will close this for now.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
