In general, `TermsQuery` performance degrades quickly as more terms are added, and once you get into hundreds (or thousands), you can pretty much forget it. (Unless there's a way to do a terms query with hundreds or thousands of terms and I just don't know the secret.) I think we should consider short-circuiting on the number of terms if it goes beyond some threshold unless some overriding argument is given. Additionally, it might be a good idea for Elastic.co documentation to warn users that many terms can have a substantial impact on latency, and of course point out the default limit/safeguard (supposing it is decided that the number of terms should be limited).\n\nRelates #11511\n","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
