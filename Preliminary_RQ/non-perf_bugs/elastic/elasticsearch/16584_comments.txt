I searched for the specific issue you're seeing and there isn't anything obvious out there. It looks like you're using the default startup flags, so there is nothing egregious there. I did observe some Groovy scripting engine events in your log, which might be surfacing a JVM bug? Maybe try upgrading the JVM to at least 7u95 if you have to stay in the 2.x line of IcedTea, otherwise try going to the latest 8u release if that's an option for you. If this reliably reproduces, I think you'll want to file a bug with OpenJDK.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/182436276","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16584#issuecomment-182436276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16584","id":182436276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjQzNjI3Ng==","user":{"login":"dstarh","id":9048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstarh","html_url":"https://github.com/dstarh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstarh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstarh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstarh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstarh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstarh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstarh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstarh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstarh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstarh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T15:44:58Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T15:44:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley @jasontedor 8.x open jdk or oracle or does it matter?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/182437701","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16584#issuecomment-182437701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16584","id":182437701,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjQzNzcwMQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T15:46:54Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T15:47:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> 8.x open jdk or oracle or does it matter?\n\n@dstarh: Oracle if you have a choice.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/183949093","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16584#issuecomment-183949093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16584","id":183949093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mzk0OTA5Mw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-14T18:48:45Z","updated_at":"2016-02-14T18:49:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dstarh: Since we think that the problem you were experiencing was due to a JVM bug, I'm closing this issue.
