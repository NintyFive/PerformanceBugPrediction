When I ran through the reproduction steps, I got the following error (slightly different from the one you pasted above, which mentions `not_analyzed` instead of `analyzed`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"caused_by\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n    \"reason\": \"Can't parse [index] value [analyzed] for field [field], expected [true] or [false]\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 5.0, the `string` field type was [broken into two distinct types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/breaking_50_mapping_changes.html#_literal_string_literal_fields_replaced_by_literal_text_literal_literal_keyword_literal_fields), `keyword` and `text`. The `keyword` type is meant for unanalyzed strings, whereas the `text` field applies an analyzer to the field content. With this distinction in place, the `index` setting now only accepts a boolean, as opposed to the enums `analyzed`, `not_analyzed`, and `no`. The correct way to adjust the dynamic template from 2.x would be to remove the `index` setting, and switch to the `text` type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"dynamic_templates\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"others\": {\r\n        \"path_match\": \"*\",\r\n        \"mapping\": {\r\n          \"norms\": false,\r\n          \"store\": false,\r\n          \"type\": \"text\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `norms` setting has also been collapsed into a single boolean.\r\n\r\nI'm not clear on why there's a difference in behavior between 2.x and 5.x in terms of how we handle the setting `\"index\": \"analyzed\"`. We are not likely to dig further into this because we're longer cutting new 2.x and 5.x releases, so I think it's best to close out the issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
