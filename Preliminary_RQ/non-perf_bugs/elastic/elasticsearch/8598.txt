It causes a slightly different date parsing function to be used, which will first try to parse as a date, and then try as a timestamp if the year is very large.  If we want to support this timestamp fallback, it should happen for all date parsing, regardless of which end of the range it came from, or whether the end is inclusive.\n\nAlso, the setting `index.mapping.date.parse_upper_inclusive` appears to be from before 1.0, and is no longer documented.  This setting is currently parsed and the value used as the default for `mapping.date.round_ceil`.  Both of these settings should be removed to ensure date ranges are parsed symmetrically.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
