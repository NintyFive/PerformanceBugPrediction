All of the user threads were WAITING, THREAD_WAITING, or RUNNABLE (in some poll).\n\nCross-referencing the process ids from \"top -H\" with the nids reported in jstack, the following threads were actively using the CPU:\n\n~19 minutes in \"\"Concurrent Mark-Sweep GC Thread\"\n~2 minutes in each of  4x \"Gang worker#0 (Parallel GC Threads)\" (worker#1,worker#2,worker#3)\n~3 minutes in \"VM Thread\" prio=10 tid=0x00002aad1c6d0000 nid=0x7041 runnable\n\nEmpirically, ongoing CPU time seemed to be split between either Mark-Sweep and 1 of the GC threads, or Mark-Sweep and the VM thread.\n\nHowever checking both bigdesk and head for the node in question, the following GC times were reported:\nParNew  12  5 seconds and 61 milliseconds\nConcurrentMarkSweep 4   5 seconds and 884 milliseconds\n\nPresumably there's nothing that can be done about the CPU activity itself, that's just what the VM needs to do when I allocate a large amount of (multi valued) field cache. That's obviously fine if so.\n\nPresuambly you also just read some standard stats to get the GC usage out - but I thought the fact the \"actual values\" weren't getting reported was issue worthy.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Alex-Ikanow","id":851950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTk1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/851950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-Ikanow","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-Ikanow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-Ikanow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-Ikanow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-Ikanow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-Ikanow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-Ikanow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-Ikanow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-Ikanow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-Ikanow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-Ikanow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
