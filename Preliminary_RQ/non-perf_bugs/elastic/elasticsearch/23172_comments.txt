I have been reading that PowerBI does actually add the Expect: 100-Continue header so this is expected. \r\n\r\nWhat is the workaround/solution here then? Changing the content-length setting in ElasticSearch?\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/566437/http-post-returns-error-417-expectation-failed\r\n\r\nEdit: This issue is solved and the header had nothing to do. I was actually testing this behind a proxy and that was actually catching the requests before my nginx/elasticsearch/powerbi. I am getting a correct response now. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
