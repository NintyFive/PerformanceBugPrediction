When those shards fail, Elasticsearch returns the failures in the json at `_shards.failures` including the HTTP response code that that failure deserves _but_ it will return an HTTP 200 response code so long as a single shard succeeds. I think it should return a non-200 HTTP status if any shard fails.\n\nDo we want to:\n1. Continue as we are and return a 200 code if any shard succeeds.\n2. Return a non-200 code if any shards fail. We'd return the highest numbered failure because that is what we do now if _all_ shards fail. You can get each response code in the `failures` array in the response. We could also talk about [RFC 4918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918)'s `207 Multi-Status` but at first glance that specifies some XML response we aren't going to implement.\n3. Add a boolean to the request to toggle between the two behaviors. We'd have to pick a default but we could default to the old behavior for 5.0 if we didn't want the change to be breaking.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
