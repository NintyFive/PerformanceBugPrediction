However, because it might fail if there are no suitable nodes available, it ought to retry whenever there is reason to believe the situation might have changed.  This could be done in a way similar to `AsyncRetryDuringSnapshotActionStep`, where a cluster state listener is registered so that the step will be retried after a cluster state update.","closed_by":{"login":"andreidan","id":1217601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1217601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan","html_url":"https://github.com/andreidan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
