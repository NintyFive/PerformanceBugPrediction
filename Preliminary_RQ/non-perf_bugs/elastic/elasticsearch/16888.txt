It should really be marked as deprecated somehow in the index. See https://imgur.com/qiDPRcn for a nice picture of it.\n\nIt'd be nice for someone who is just coming to Elasticsearch for the first time to be able to skip the deprecated stuff entirely but I don't see how that is possible without a crazy maintenance burden. Maybe it is enough to just mark the deprecated stuff in the index as deprecated and sort it to the bottom of the lists. Or something. I dunno.\n\nReported [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/elasticsearch/comments/48h34n/elasticsearch_rest_api_inconsistent/).\n","closed_by":{"login":"debadair","id":362578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjU3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/362578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair","html_url":"https://github.com/debadair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
