are already two open issues for `ClusterDisruptionIT#testAckedIndexing`, #36789 and #36042, but a new type of failure occurred in https://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+master+intake/1480/console\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR   12.1s J0 | ClusterDisruptionIT.testAckedIndexing <<< FAILURES!\r\n   > Throwable #1:

of the test (while iterating `exceptedExceptions`), which caused the underlying assertion failure exception to be lost:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        } finally {\r\n            if (exceptedExceptions.size() > 0) {\r\n                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\r\n                for (Exception e : exceptedExceptions) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, looking at the log messages the underlying assertion failure must have been the one from line 183, between these two log messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                logger.info(\"waiting for indexing requests to complete\");\r\n                assertTrue(countDownLatchRef.get().await(docsPerIndexer * seconds * 1000 + 2000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS));\r\n\r\n                logger.info(\"stopping disruption\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result of the exception in the `finally` block the background threads kicked off by the test were leaked.\r\n\r\nThe repro command is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew :server:integTest \\\r\n  -Dtests.seed=FB2F1C569F462B5B
