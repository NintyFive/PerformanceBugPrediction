When I run this test on a somewhat bigger machine locally I cannot get it to fail but I get close to execution times as low as 5-7ms, so I think it is entirely possible that on faster machines this might occasionally get rounded to 0ms. I think we can relax the assertion to `greaterThanOrEqualTo(0L)`. I will check if there are other similar occurances in this integration test and open a PR.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
