Sorry for incomplete description. I re-describe the question again.\nI have a amount of docs in indices in ES. e.g \n\n```\n{\n    '_source': {\n    'title': 'Foo bar foobar foo barbar',\n    'headers': 'HTTP/1.0 200 OK\nServer: GeoHttpServer\nDate: Thu, 18 Jun 2015 19:02:31 GMT\nContent-type: text/html',\n    'city': 'US'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd the query with highlight option e.g.\n\n```\n{\n   \"query\": {\"match\": {\"title\": \"foo\"}},\n   \"highlight\": {\n   \"fields\": {\"title\": {\"force_source\": true} }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhile the response result was \n\n```\n{\n    '_source': {\n    'title': 'Foo bar foobar foo barbar',\n    'headers': 'HTTP/1.0 200 OK\nServer: GeoHttpServer\nDate: Thu, 18 Jun 2015 19:02:31 GMT\nContent-type: text/html',\n    'city': 'US'\n    }\n    'highlight': [{'title': \"Foo bar foobar <em>foo</em> barbar\"}]\n}\n```\n\nI set `force_source: true` in field highlight-option while the _source.title without the highlight tags `<em></em>`.
