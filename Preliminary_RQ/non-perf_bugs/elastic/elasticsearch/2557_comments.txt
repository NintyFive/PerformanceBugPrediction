It'd be great if adding shard-size as a configurable weight was an option.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/12377422","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2557#issuecomment-12377422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2557","id":12377422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzc3NDIy","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-17T17:02:06Z","updated_at":"2013-01-17T17:02:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hey @dakrone, further developments will likely add additional weights related to what you are mentioning.
