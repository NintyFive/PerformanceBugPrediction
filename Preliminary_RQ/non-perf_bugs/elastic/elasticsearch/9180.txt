'manger' also analyzes to 'manger' so it should match.\n\nI tried to fetch the internal values of the field for the document in question. I added a script field containing doc['field'].values and the result are the following\n\n``` javascript\n    [\n        \"a\",\n        \"mang\",\n        \"petit\",\n        \"sall\"\n    ]\n```\n\nTried it on 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 with Standard, Hunspell and Phonetic analyzers consecutively.\n\nSimple question : WTF DID I DO WRONG ?\n","closed_by":{"login":"JimminiKin","id":1327193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjcxOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1327193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimminiKin","html_url":"https://github.com/JimminiKin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimminiKin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimminiKin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimminiKin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimminiKin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimminiKin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimminiKin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimminiKin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimminiKin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimminiKin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
