Set `index.number_of_shards: 3` in `config/elasticsearch.yml`\n2. Create the scripts index with a single shard\n\n```\nDELETE /.scripts/\n\nPUT /.scripts/\n{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"index\": {\n      \"number_of_shards\": 1,\n      \"number_of_replicas\": 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n1. Call `GET /.scripts/` and see there are three shards for this index.\n\nThis does not happen with index templates it seems.\nAlso regular indexes are created correctly with one shard.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
