To reproduce, start elasticsearch with 32M heap and run the following script for a few minutes: https://gist.github.com/7163ea88b52018cdb66c.\n\nThe script cache parameters should be configurable using the following settings:\n- `script.cache.size` - allows to specify the maximum number of compiled scripts to be stored in the cache. 0 means no cache, -1 - unbounded cache. The default value is 100.\n- `script.cache.expire` - allows to specify the length of time after a compiled script is last accessed that it should be automatically removed. The default value is no expiration. \n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
