However this is not true eg. in the case that `min_doc_count=0` on a sub terms aggregation. The bug is in `BucketsAggregator.bucketAggregations` which does this:\n\n```\n    protected final InternalAggregations bucketAggregations(long bucketOrd) {\n        final ArrayList<InternalAggregation> childAggs = new ArrayList<>();\n        final long bucketDocCount = bucketDocCount(bucketOrd);\n        if (bucketDocCount == 0L) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < subAggregators.length; i++) {\n                childAggs.add(subAggregators[i].buildEmptyAggregation()); // <-- This is wrong\n            }\n        } else {\n            // deal with non-empty buckets\n        }\n\n        return new InternalAggregations(childAggs);\n    }\n```\n\nReproducible with the following Sense script on 1.x:\n\n```\nPUT test \n{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"number_of_shards\": 2\n  }\n}\n\nPUT test/test/1\n{\n  \"minutes\": 300,\n  \"megabytes\": 1000\n}\n\nPUT test/test/2\n{\n  \"minutes\": 200,\n  \"megabytes\": 5000\n}\n\nGET test/_search\n{  \n   \"post_filter\":{  \n      \"term\":{  \n         \"megabytes\":1000\n      }\n   },\n   \"aggs\":{  \n      \"minutes\":{  \n         \"filter\":{  \n            \"term\":{  \n               \"megabytes\":1000\n            }\n         },\n         \"aggs\":{  \n            \"minutes\":{  \n               \"terms\":{  \n                  \"field\":\"minutes\",\n                  \"min_doc_count\":0\n               }\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
