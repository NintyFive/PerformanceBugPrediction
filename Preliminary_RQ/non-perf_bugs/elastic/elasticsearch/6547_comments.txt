We have tests to make sure sorting works on a sub-aggregation so maybe that's enough? The only change that could be worth making is to randomise the metric used in the sorted for that test, but that might be tricky as the sort order of the buckets would change too so it might be complex to calculate the correct sort order in the tests based on a random option\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
