tried the same this morning with elasticsearch `1.4.2` and Azure plugin `2.5.2-SNAPSHOT` and everything went well on the same dataset. Snapshot was complete (no missing file) and restore obviously went well.\n\nMy suspicion about the initial issue is that something was incorrect at snapshot time but we somehow swallow the exception thrown by Azure instead of failing the Snapshot or doing a retry.\n\nWhile debugging that, I found some bugs in the way we currently do Snapshot and Restore in Azure plugin, so I'll fix issues I found so far. For example, when you remove a container from Azure console, even if Azure told you that it has been done, it appears to be an asynchronous deletion so you can hit error like `can not initialize container [elasticsearch-snapshots]: [The specified container is being deleted. Try operation later.]` but this error does not fail the snapshot...\n\nWe can close this issue in elasticsearch core now and follow up the discussion in Azure plugin: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-cloud-azure/issues/51\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
