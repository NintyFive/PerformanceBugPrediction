It works fine if the user has enough contacts but I have one user where there are only two contacts and this fails.\n\nSo I do a GET on\nhttp://localhost:9200/users/contact/_search?search_type=scan&scroll=60m&size=100\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"term\": {\n           \"userId\": {\n              \"value\": \"1o\"\n           }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI get back the following response\n{\n    \"_scroll_id\":\"c2Nhbjs1OzIwMTpxS1hwWW80MFJvV0hwbjdBcm5JRkF3OzIwNDpxS1hwWW80MFJvV0hwbjdBcm5JRkF3OzIwMzpxS1hwWW80MFJvV0hwbjdBcm5JRkF3OzIwMjpxS1hwWW80MFJvV0hwbjdBcm5JRkF3OzIwNTpxS1hwWW80MFJvV0hwbjdBcm5JRkF3OzE7dG90YWxfaGl0czoyOw==\",\n    \"took\":1,\n    \"timed_out\":false,\n    \"_shards\":{\n        \"total\":5,\n        \"successful\":5,\n        \"failed\":0\n    },\n    \"hits\":{\n        \"total\":2,\n        \"max_score\":0.0,\n        \"hits\":[\n\n```\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n}\n\nand then http://localhost:9200/_search/scroll?scroll=60m \nc2Nhbjs1OzIwMTpxS1hwWW80MFJvV0hwbjdBcm5JRkF3OzIwNDpxS1hwWW80MFJvV0hwbjdBcm5JRkF3OzIwMzpxS1hwWW80MFJvV0hwbjdBcm5JRkF3OzIwMjpxS1hwWW80MFJvV0hwbjdBcm5JRkF3OzIwNTpxS1hwWW80MFJvV0hwbjdBcm5JRkF3OzE7dG90YWxfaGl0czoyOw==\n\nfails with a SearchContextMissingException \n\nThe same query for a user with 30000 contacts works fine and pages through the results like I would expect.  The above query returns the two results normally if I query without search_type=scan\n\nSo it only fails if the result set is smaller than the page size\n","closed_by":{"login":"jillesvangurp","id":819187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxOTE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/819187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jillesvangurp","html_url":"https://github.com/jillesvangurp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jillesvangurp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jillesvangurp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jillesvangurp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jillesvangurp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jillesvangurp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jillesvangurp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jillesvangurp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jillesvangurp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jillesvangurp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
