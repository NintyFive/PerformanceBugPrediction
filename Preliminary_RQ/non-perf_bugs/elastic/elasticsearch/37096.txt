However in Elasticsearch 7 we have another alternative that can automatically skip non-competitive documents based on the maximum score of each term in the query. This new method doesn't require any configuration (no cutoff frequency) and can be much faster than the `common_terms` alternative if the total number of hits that matches the query is not tracked. \r\nFor this reason I wonder if we could/should deprecate/remove the other alternatives (`common_terms` and `cutoff_frequency`), they should not be needed anymore since we have a better alternative that doesn't require to set a cutoff frequency while still being able to speed up queries with high frequency terms.","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
