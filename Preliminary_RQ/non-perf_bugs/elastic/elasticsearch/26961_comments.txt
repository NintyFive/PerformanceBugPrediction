The behaviour would be the same, if I did this, for 3,4,n clusters. \r\n\r\nWhen I deploy Elasticsearch to new environments via our pipelines, I will want them to be cross-cluster enabled, off the bat. Given that we have DC's in multiple regions, it makes sense not to join those nodes to the cluster. So in my head cross-cluster-search is a good fit. \r\n\r\nShould I have analysts in AUS, I wouldn't expect them to logon to a Kibana node in the UK as the latency would be terrible. So, having cross-cluster-search enabled in each cluster makes sense as operators/analysts should be working on their own local region, but have access to the data residing in other clusters should they need it. \r\n\r\nE.g in a 24x7 NOC/SOC, if they are normally working through events in New York, they may find value comparing this to the same time period in London.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, thanks!

It only checks that what you are registering exists and it can connect to it. The requirement is to register the remote cluster when that's online though if you do it in the configuration file. This relates a bit to what we discussed in #26118, where we will make clusters optional (meaning one cluster offline won't cause the whole cross cluster search to fail), but still I am not sure that we should allow to register any cluster even if not available. @s1monw thoughts?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/336437413","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26961#issuecomment-336437413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26961","id":336437413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjQzNzQxMw==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-13T12:21:34Z","updated_at":"2017-10-13T12:21:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"heya @nicpalmer I did some more digging and I was wrong when I said that remote clusters need to be available at registration time in any case.
