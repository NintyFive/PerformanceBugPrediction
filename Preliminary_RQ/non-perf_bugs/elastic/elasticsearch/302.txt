The first setting supported is the `index.number_of_replicas` setting allowing to dynamically change the number of replicas an index has. \n\nThe REST endpoint is `/_settings` (to update all indices) or `{index}/_settings` to update one (or more) indices settings. The body of the request includes the updated settings, for example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"index\" : {\n        \"number_of_replicas\" : 4\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above will change the number of replicas to 4 from the current number of replicas. Here is a curl example:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/my_index/_settings' -d '\n{\n    \"index\" : {\n        \"number_of_replicas\" : 4\n    }\n}\n'\n```\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
