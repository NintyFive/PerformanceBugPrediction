It looks like this is caused when the other side closes its connection while we're waiting on our buffer to fill up. We totally expect that in this test. It feels to me like we should throw a `ConnectionClosedException` but upstream does not agree:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPASYNC-134\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to catch this exception and \"expected\".\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could translate on our side but that seems like a bigger change to make so I'd like to propose the simpler fix first.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
