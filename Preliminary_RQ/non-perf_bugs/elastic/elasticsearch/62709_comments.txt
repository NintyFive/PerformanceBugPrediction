When originally trying to reproduce this issue, I thought I had verified oracle jdk 15 also failed, but I must have gotten jdks mixed up. I've now verified you are correct, Oracle jdk 15 does continue to work on CentOS 6.\r\n\r\nAt this time though, I'm not sure we should yet do anything. We switched away from the oracle jdk because of notarization issues on MacOS (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46498).\r\n\r\nI did find a recent issue (https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build/issues/2097) in AdoptopenJDK regarding the glibc version. Perhaps they will fix their build chain as suggested there, we will just have to wait and see.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/704517961","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62709#issuecomment-704517961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62709","id":704517961,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNDUxNzk2MQ==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-06T19:55:14Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T19:55:14Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra (:Core/Infra/Build)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/704634123","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62709#issuecomment-704634123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62709","id":704634123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNDYzNDEyMw==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-07T01:10:51Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T01:10:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This has been fixed by switch the bundled JDK back to Oracle JDK.
