Looking at it from the Elasticsearch side for example from  a data node perpsective, the ingest node is definitively ingesting data. Looking at it from Beats / Logstash, we send that to a \"processing\" node to do the processing.\r\n\r\nThe part where it's getting confusing to me is when we talk about the \"ingesting data\" part of our Elastic Stack and actually mean Beats and Logstash because these are actually doing the ingest part (which I think is correct). Also in the docs of the ingest node we correctly state that ingest is not actually ingesting data itself: \"You can use ingest node to pre-process documents before the actual indexing takes place.\" We only talk about processing.\r\n\r\nI'm on the same page with @jordansissel here that I think when looking at the Elastic Stack \"Ingest Node\" is definitively not an optimal name. From just an elasticsearch perspective it makes more sense. I don't think we should make a change here in the short term as it would break lots of things but it's definitively something we should keep in mind when talking about the long term vision of the \"ingest parts\".","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/301711491","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24686#issuecomment-301711491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24686","id":301711491,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTcxMTQ5MQ==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T08:24:47Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T08:24:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Was funny that this question came yesterday at a training we gave with @zumo64.
