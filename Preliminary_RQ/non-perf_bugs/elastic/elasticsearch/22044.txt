While the elasticsearch.rpm pre/post install scripts do a good job in setting the ownership of directories to a user/group specified in /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch, they fail to correctly configure systemd service. The values for User and Group are left with the default 'elasticsearch'. This essentially renders user/group settings in aforementioned sysconfig file useless. In a controlled environments where all users are defined not locally on servers, but in central directory, the user/group name could be different due to naming standards, etc.\r\nPlease fix the pre/post installation script to set the correct User/Group values in the same way it chowns the log/data/config directories.\r\n\r\nSeen this on the 5.0.1 version.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
