We generally use github issues for bugs and feature requests.\n\nThis doesn't look like a bug, your cluster update settings request is malformed. Also, tweaking your threadppol settings doesn't seem like a great idea to me. If you can move this to the mailing list this can be better discussed so you can get some advice.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
