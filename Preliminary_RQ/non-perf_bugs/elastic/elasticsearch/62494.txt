Rather than build a dedicated endpoint for validation, it was suggested that we perform a query of `size: 0` to receive any `parsing_exception`s etc. but not incur the cost of data retrieval/processing.\r\n\r\nHowever, providing `size: 0` to an EQL query currently returns the following error: \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"error\" : {\r\n    \"root_cause\" : [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\" : \"action_request_validation_exception\",\r\n        \"reason\" : \"Validation Failed: 1: size must be greater than 0;\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"type\" : \"action_request_validation_exception\",\r\n    \"reason\" : \"Validation Failed: 1: size must be greater than 0;\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"status\" : 400\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile we can use `size: 1` for the time being and incur that additional overhead, support for `size: 0` would be great!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
