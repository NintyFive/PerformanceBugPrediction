IMO it makes more sense to offload this decision to you as a developer/engineer who has to scale the cluster. But opinions differ here I guess :-)\nUsing solely response times as a performance metric might lead to complex queries being treated as slow, even thoug they are just slow by nature... (again, just showing some off the complexity with this approach)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/48325940","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/353#issuecomment-48325940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/353","id":48325940,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MzI1OTQw","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-08T11:46:35Z","updated_at":"2014-07-08T11:46:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No discussion for over a year.
