I'll assign it to myself and hopefully get a fix soon\n\n@gmarz formatting numeric results can be useful to do things such as padding and rounding when required. The `format` parameter should work on terms, and histogram when the field is numeric. I will look into that as well as fixing this issue so the `as_string` field is only present in the result when `format` is specified (or the field is a date).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
