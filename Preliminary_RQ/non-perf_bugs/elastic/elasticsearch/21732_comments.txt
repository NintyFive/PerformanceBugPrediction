I allude to my opinion about this in #21723. I think context is the hard part about scripting in Elasticsearch in general. A tool like this would be good to work on painless scripting syntax but doesn't really help you to understand the context in the first place. I'm trying to put together recipes that let you explore those contexts in #21723. I know that watcher is hard to explore but I think that is something watcher should solve.\r\n\r\nI'm just really worried that a tool like this will give you a false sense of security because it only emulates the context in which a script runs. If we have a way to make it super accurate I'd be much more excited about this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/262458838","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21732#issuecomment-262458838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21732","id":262458838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjQ1ODgzOA==","user":{"login":"robin13","id":174291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/174291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin13","html_url":"https://github.com/robin13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-23T08:43:57Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T08:43:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't think the tool could/should/would be used to determine \"this takes 2ms to run here, so I presume it will be the same on the cluster\", but rather to compare \"is this way of solving the puzzle faster than that way\", and moreover to have an ability to add lines / make changes to the script or context data and test the outcome in quick iterations without having to do the many steps necessary to transfer a script to a server, adjust the source data or query to get the desired context, wait for the server to automatically detect the new script, .... and then run it (only to notice some annoying syntax error, and have to wait at least one minute to be able to run it again).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/355436364","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21732#issuecomment-355436364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21732","id":355436364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTQzNjM2NA==","user":{"login":"sunilpwyd","id":6550953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTA5NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6550953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilpwyd","html_url":"https://github.com/sunilpwyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilpwyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilpwyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilpwyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilpwyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilpwyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilpwyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilpwyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilpwyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunilpwyd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-05T00:10:16Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T00:10:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This feature is highly recommended.
