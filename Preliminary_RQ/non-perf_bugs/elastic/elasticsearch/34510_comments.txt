The same idea was more recently suggested in #39334 and we discussed that as a team and agreed it was a good idea. There's little point in having both issues open, and although this one was opened first we added our collective thoughts in \r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39334#issuecomment-467891057. Therefore I am closing this as a duplicate. Please continue any discussion of this idea over on #39334.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
