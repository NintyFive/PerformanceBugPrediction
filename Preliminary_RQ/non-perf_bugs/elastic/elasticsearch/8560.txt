On a 2 node cluster, when I execute a query with this custom aggregation, I get the following warning in ES logs:\n\n```\n[2014-11-20 00:50:14,319][WARN ][transport.netty          ] [Blue Streak] Message not fully read (response) for [313] handler org.elasticsearch.search.action.SearchServiceTransportAction$6@27f233b2, error [false], resetting\n```\n\nOn debugging, I found that a NPE is thrown by the following line:\n\n```\nInternalAggregation aggregation = AggregationStreams.stream(type).readResult(in);\n```\n\nin `InternalAggregations.java`. \n\nSeems like I've not registered streams for my custom aggregation and I am not able to figure a way to do it. FYI, I do not have any module defined for my custom aggregation. I am simply adding a custom `AggregatorParser` in `onModule(AggregationModule)` method. This method is defined in a class that extends `AbstractPlugin`. Can you help me register streams for my custom aggregation?\n","closed_by":{"login":"bittusarkar","id":860447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDQ0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/860447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittusarkar","html_url":"https://github.com/bittusarkar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittusarkar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittusarkar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittusarkar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittusarkar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittusarkar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittusarkar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittusarkar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittusarkar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittusarkar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
