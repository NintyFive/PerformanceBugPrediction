forget it, I found https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/resources/org/elasticsearch/tasks/task-index-mapping.json and the code

index template that used _doc as mapping, so the index creation failed with `Rejecting mapping update to [.tasks] as the final mapping would have more than 1 type: [task, _doc]`, and I could have seen this in the logs.\r\nThanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/431035900","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23631#issuecomment-431035900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23631","id":431035900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTAzNTkwMA==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-18T14:42:01Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T14:42:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah!
