You can configure the existing task using the 'wrapper { }' syntax or create your custom task under a different name.'.`\r\n\r\n`As part of making the publishing plugins stable, the 'deferred configurable' behavior of the 'publishing {}' block is now deprecated. Please add 'enableFeaturePreview('STABLE_PUBLISHING')' to your settings file and do a test run by publishing to a local repository. If all artifacts are published as expected, there is nothing else to do. If the published artifacts change unexpectedly, please see the migration guide for more details: https://docs.gradle.org/4.8/userguide/publishing_maven.html#publishing_maven:deferred_configuration. In Gradle 5.0 the flag will be removed and the new behavior will become the default.`\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe AbstractFileCollection.getBuildDependencies() method has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in Gradle 5.0.
