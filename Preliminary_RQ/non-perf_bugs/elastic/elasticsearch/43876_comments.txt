I have a question, though: the issue description and fix indicate that this is specific to SQL, but I seem to be having the same problem in Canvas when doing a \"raw documents\" query when my Kibana index pattern matches many indices (I haven't configured any aliases).  If I use an index pattern without a wildcard (one concrete index), it works.  Do you expect this to fix that case as well, or should I file a separate bug?  Or, when will the cherry-pick be in the 7.2 docker image so I can try the fix out?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/510430652","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43876#issuecomment-510430652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43876","id":510430652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDQzMDY1Mg==","user":{"login":"astefan","id":893749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/893749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan","html_url":"https://github.com/astefan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-11T10:33:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T10:33:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@blfrantz indeed, this is a specific issue in SQL. If you used an SQL query in Canvas in your test and still see the issue, it's very likely that you are using a version of Elasticsearch that doesn't have the fix. The version labels in this github issue as well as the versions mentioned in my latest comment should be ones that will have the fix.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
