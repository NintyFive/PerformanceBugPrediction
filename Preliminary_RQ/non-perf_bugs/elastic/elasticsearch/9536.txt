Here's a rough picture of the mapping:\n\n```\nUser\n  UserId\n    Sessions (array)\n        Session1 - CreateDate, Country\n        Session2 - CreateDate, Country\n```\n\nWhat I'm wanting to do is pass in a date range, and get an output of the logins by country, with ONLY a single session per user. In other words, if the user logged in 3 times during the date range, only 1 of those sessions would count towards the overall count.\n\nThe output would look something like the following:\n\n```\nCountry Aggregations\n    USA, Count: 10\n    Japan, Count: 15\n    Spain, Count: 23\n```\n\nI've been looking over nested aggregations, but I'm not sure they can give me what I need. The main problem I'm having is that if a User has multiple Sessions during the date range, each of those sessions contribute to the overall country count. Is there a way to filter this inner list of nested documents down so that only 1 will contribute to the aggregation per User?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
