logic needs clarification and seems inconsistent:\r\n\r\nDiscoveryNodes.resolver resolves an empty list of node id's to all nodes:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/node/DiscoveryNodes.java#L329\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to consumers of this API which explicitly check if the resolved nodes have length == 0, e.g.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/support/tasks/TransportTasksAction.java#L241\r\n\r\nDue to the implicit to all resolving this can never happen.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that:\r\n\r\n- only `null` should trigger a resolve to all nodes but\r\n- an empty array should resolve to an empty array of nodes\r\n\r\nThis is potentially a tricky change. If you disagree, meaning if the current behavior is desired it would be good to clarify and document this.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
