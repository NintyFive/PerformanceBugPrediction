Like you noticed it had the bad side effect of clearing the cache. It was also quite a tricky operation in terms of concurrency: the implementation was not 100% correct, which could lead to memory leaks in some rare cases. So we decided to not offer the ability to resize the filter cache live when we switched to a new cache. This new requires nodes to be restarted.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/255669428","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21086#issuecomment-255669428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21086","id":255669428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTY2OTQyOA==","user":{"login":"makeyang","id":13898618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODk4NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13898618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang","html_url":"https://github.com/makeyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-24T07:41:28Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T07:41:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jpountz  any plan to make new cache dynamicly resize?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/255698872","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21086#issuecomment-255698872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21086","id":255698872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTY5ODg3Mg==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-24T10:00:34Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T10:00:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No. Resizing the filter cache correctly would be hard to get right and on the other hand, resizing the cache should be a rare operation so when we discussed it we concluded it was fair to require a node restart to change the cache size.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
