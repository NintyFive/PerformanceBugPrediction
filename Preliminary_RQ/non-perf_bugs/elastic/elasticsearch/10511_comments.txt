You have the same doc id in different types, one is \"vessel\", the other one is \"other\". It is actually fine to have two documents with the same id in different types in an index because documents are identified by type + id. \nHowever, the documentation does not seem to explicitly state that anywhere. I opened issue https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10515 for that. \nI will close this issue for now. Please feel free to reopen in case anything is unclear.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/91377219","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10511#issuecomment-91377219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10511","id":91377219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxMzc3MjE5","user":{"login":"mrec","id":4206148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4206148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrec","html_url":"https://github.com/mrec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrec/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-09T23:03:58Z","updated_at":"2015-04-09T23:03:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hmm, I hadn't noticed that. It might not be an issue on Elastic's side, but it's definitely an issue on ours; the ids we supply **are** supposed to be globally unique across **all** types. I'll check some other duplicates and see if the same discrepancy applies to all of them; if so, something has gone badly wrong in another part of the system.\n\nThanks for the keen observiness.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
