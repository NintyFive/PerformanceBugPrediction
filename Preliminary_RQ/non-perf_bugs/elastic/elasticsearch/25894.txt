field and highlight on `autocomplete_highlight`. Everything works fine until I meet `_` in a search query. `icu_tokenizer` keeps it while `autocomplete_highlight` tokenizer removes as it keeps letters and digits only. Here I can't keep `_` only but full `punctuation` class instead that comes with a whole load of additional symbols that I don't need and they have to go.\r\n\r\nI would be helpful to be able to specify exact characters to keep like `_`.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I've implemented char_filter that replaces `_` with `-` but that's suboptimal as `_` is considered a part of words (same as in `icu_tokenizer`) and is expected to match rather than being ignored.","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
