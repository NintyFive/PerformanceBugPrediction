All data returned is 0. \r\n\r\nI loaded a few million documents into an index, timeseries data, for Feb 2018. I'm easily able to use this data directly in timelion with a simple query such as `.es(index=callrecord*,timefield=startDate)` with the time selector set to last 60 days. I get a nice line graph showing the count of my records.\r\n\r\nIn Canvas, I placed a time selector, set it to last 90 days, and then dropped in a data table.
