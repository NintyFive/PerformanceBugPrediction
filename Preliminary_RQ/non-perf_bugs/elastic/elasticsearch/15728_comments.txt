Unfortunately, HTTP compression is disabled by default (see #1482) . @kimchy can you remember the details?\n> \n> I tested this out with 10 indices containing the same mapping of twenty fields, and it reduced a GET _mapping from 5589 bytes to 209 bytes... Sounds like this could be worth doing.\n\nHTTP compression would likely be a wash at best. The issue is the size of the object being deserialized, not the actual bytes going over the wire. The browser's JSON deserializer tends to have issue deserializing single objects over a couple megs, which isn't uncommon for users with many fields in many indices. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/207033629","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15728#issuecomment-207033629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15728","id":207033629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzAzMzYyOQ==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T18:14:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T18:14:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> There are also fields such as _type, _id, etc for which the rules are unclear.\n\nThis is something that we could fix by using the same index/doc_values/fielddata convention as other fields.
