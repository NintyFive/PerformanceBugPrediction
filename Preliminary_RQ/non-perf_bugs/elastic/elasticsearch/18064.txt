Of course I could use a `text` field instead and set `fielddata: true` but that would not create doc values for this field.\n\nI can imagine that we allow an analyzer at index time for this field.\n\nWe can restrict its usage if we wish and only allows analyzers which are using tokenizers like `lowercase`, `keyword`, `path` but I would let the user decide.\n\nIf we allow setting `analyzer: simple` for example, my aggregation will become:\n\n```\nsan francisco: 3\n```\n\nSame applies for path tokenizer.\n\nLet say I'm building a dir tree like:\n\n```\n/tmp/dir1/file1.txt\n/tmp/dir1/file2.txt\n/tmp/dir2/file3.txt\n/tmp/dir2/file4.txt\n```\n\nApplying a path tokenizer would help me to generate an aggregation like:\n\n```\n/tmp/dir1: 2\n/tmp/dir2: 2\n/tmp: 4\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
