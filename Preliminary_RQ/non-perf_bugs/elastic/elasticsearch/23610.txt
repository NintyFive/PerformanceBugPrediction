(In 2.3.2, though I don't think anything's changed in later versions.)\r\n\r\nIn the HTTP API, when you request e.g. `[25, 50, 75]` percentiles, all you get back is exactly that. In the Java API, on the other hand, you get back a serialized `InternalTDigestPercentiles` which *can* be queried for the specific percentiles you requested, but also for any other percentile you might be interested in.\r\n\r\nWe use Percentiles in a calibration request to find bucket boundaries for a subsequent Range aggregation, and this becomes relevant when you have a very skewed distribution swamped by a single value, so that the `[25, 50, 75]` percentiles might all be the same value. Since the Range agg is driving faceted drilldown UI and a single-bucket navigator is pretty pointless, in this case we use the `InternalTDigestPercentiles` to binary-chop around until we find some useful bucket boundaries. AIUI this would no longer be possible with the HTTP API.\r\n\r\nIt's not the end of the world; one alternative considered was requesting a lot more percentiles up front to improve our chances of getting 3 different ones, and that wouldn't depend on the API. In a perfect world there'd be a Range variant for \"***N*** optimally-balanced buckets\" instead of for explicit bucket boundaries, which would do away with the need for the extra calibration round-trip, but that's probably wishful thinking.","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
