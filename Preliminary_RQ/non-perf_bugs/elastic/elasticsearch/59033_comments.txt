Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question or a concrete usage problem than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead.\r\n\r\nJust to give you some pointers:\r\n\r\n> NoShardAvailableActionException: No shard available for [get [.kibana][_doc][space:default]: routing [null]]\",\r\n\r\nThis means Elasticsearch cannot find any data for the Kibana system index \".kibana\". The reasons for this can be varied and the log you added doesn't directly answer the question why this index isn't available. Hopefully someone in the forum can point you at diggign up more useful information.\r\n\r\n>  FileNotFoundException[/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/analysis-ik/config/surname.dic (No such file or directory)]; ], markAsStale [true]]\", \"cluster.uuid\": \"0Rcai9yFSimfmGGddKFYIQ\", \"node.id\": \"6kM_NPnHQNa8d2H3tkUxNQ\" ,\r\n2020/7/4 下午7:55:17\"stacktrace\": [\"java.lang.RuntimeException: ik-analyzer: Surname not found!!!\"\r\n\r\nThis is another problem. Some index of yours uses the ik-analyzer which is missing some files. Again, it's unclear why those files are not there, maybe a new node was started and the plugin not configured correctly, maybe some previously existing file got removed or corrupted? Hope you can get more information on this on the forums.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
