Create a new index using the following mapping:\r\n```json\r\nPUT test\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"_doc\": {\r\n      \"dynamic\": \"strict\",\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"created \": {\r\n          \"type\": \"date\",\r\n          \"format\": \"yyyy/MM/dd\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Index a new document\r\n```json\r\nPUT test/_doc/1\r\n{\r\n  \"created\": \"2016/01/01\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOn following the above steps, step 2 results in the following error even though the field `created` is present in the mapping and the input date matches the format specified for the field as well:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"root_cause\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"strict_dynamic_mapping_exception\",\r\n        \"reason\": \"mapping set to strict, dynamic introduction of [created] within [_doc] is not allowed\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"type\": \"strict_dynamic_mapping_exception\",\r\n    \"reason\": \"mapping set to strict, dynamic introduction of [created] within [_doc] is not allowed\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"status\": 400\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Expected result**: \r\nThe document should get indexed.\r\n\r\n**Special Notes:**\r\nRemoving `\"dynamic\": \"strict\"` from the mapping above results in the correct behaviour.\r\nReplacing to `\"dynamic\": false` allows to index the document but the data against the field `created` get saved in `_source` but doesn't get indexed. For e.g. range query doesn't return the expected document.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nishantsaini","id":5706169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDYxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5706169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantsaini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
