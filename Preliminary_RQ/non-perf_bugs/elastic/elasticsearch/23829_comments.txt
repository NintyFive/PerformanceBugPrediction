I can reproduce this on 5.x and master.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is in the context of field collapsing, I suspect it's ultimately an `inner_hits` problem similar to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21312.

Notably, using the full-object representation of _source does succeed in delivering a result with an empty source field, i.e. `\"_source\" : { },`.
