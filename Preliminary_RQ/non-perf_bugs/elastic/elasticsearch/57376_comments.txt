It shouldn't be stopping.\r\n\r\nIf it works with curl but times out in kibana then it is kibana timing out waiting for it. I believe your choices are to use [wait_for_completion=false](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html#docs-reindex-task-api) and poll for the results or to leave kibana. Keep in mind, though, that if you connect to Elasticsearch through a firewall it is likely to chop your connection in 10 minutes or something like that.\r\n\r\nSo far these seems like the kind of thing we'd prefer be on discuss.elastic.co because it isn't so much a bug with reindex as it is confusion about how to use it. That being said, if you have any ideas for how to make the docs more clear I'm all ears.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/637168681","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57376#issuecomment-637168681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57376","id":637168681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzE2ODY4MQ==","user":{"login":"vrcsekhar","id":66083890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDgzODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/66083890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrcsekhar","html_url":"https://github.com/vrcsekhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrcsekhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrcsekhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrcsekhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrcsekhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrcsekhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrcsekhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrcsekhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrcsekhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrcsekhar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-01T22:57:41Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T22:57:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sure Nik closing the issue, i don't have any issue with the reindex api it's the client connection i'm unable to keep (curl\\kibana\\ powershell invoke_webrequest etc). \r\nBasically reindex api is get and post from remote to dest and i'm able to achieve it with a workaround solution using .net code.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
