It would be safer and avoid unintentional upgrades to have the repository disabled and instruct users to explicitly enabled it when actually necessary (ex. `yum --enablerepo=elasticsearch install elasticsearch`). We should add a short paragraph explaining why it is disabled by default, and that it is an operational choice on whether to enable it.\r\n\r\nFor deb installs, it looks like we would need to provide default instructions for pinning, but the steps involved can vary depending upon the distribution - which seems better suited to be split out to a different issue if that is something we want to tackle.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rpm.html#rpm-repo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
