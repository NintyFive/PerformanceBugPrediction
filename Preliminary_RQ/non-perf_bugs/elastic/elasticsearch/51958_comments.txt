There is the slowlog, which is disabled by default, and logging there is controlled by the request time. While it can be abused for this purpose (by setting the thresholds very low), I'm not sure that we would want to rely on this for surfacing such issues. \r\n\r\nI wonder what is the usual underlying issue? Is it watcher compilations (which should really be internal and not subject to compilation limits), or is it users inline scripts being sent with unique values per request? I haven't heard of needing to have fine grained hit/miss info in other Elasticsearch caches, so I wonder why this is only a problem in scripting?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/584812042","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51958#issuecomment-584812042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51958","id":584812042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDgxMjA0Mg==","user":{"login":"stu-elastic","id":24232742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjMyNzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24232742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic","html_url":"https://github.com/stu-elastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-11T19:34:35Z","updated_at":"2020-02-11T19:34:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing in favor of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52232","performed_via_github_app":null}]
