[Running as a Service on Windows](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-service-win.html) is a great foundation, though it should be expanded to include:\n- _specific_ steps for configuring minimum and maximum heap size\n- any/all other service options documented in [Running as a Service on Linux](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-service.html#setup-service) relevant to Windows. Mostly, how and where to configure environment variables.\n- other Windows specific considerations\n\nFor most of these, it just means launching `bin/service manager` and adding configurations to the Java tab. \n\nThe Linux doc is a good example of how the Windows version should be. Whether ES uses init.d or systemd, it is clear where and how to configure the service. \n","closed_by":{"login":"gmarz","id":1594777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ3Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1594777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz","html_url":"https://github.com/gmarz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
