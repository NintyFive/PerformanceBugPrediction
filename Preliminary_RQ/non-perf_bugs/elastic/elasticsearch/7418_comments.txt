The parameter is `filters` not `filter`\n2. The `filters` parameter is not taken into account unless you also specify a `tokenizer`\n3. The `standard` analyzer (used by default) used to remove stopwords, but doesn't do so since 1.0.0\n\nSo your query is actually showing the change in behaviour of the `standard` analyzer, not the `stop` filter.  Try this instead:\n\n```\ncurl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_analyze?tokenizer=standard&filters=stop' -d \"\ngame of thrones OR_REPLACE travel\n\"\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
