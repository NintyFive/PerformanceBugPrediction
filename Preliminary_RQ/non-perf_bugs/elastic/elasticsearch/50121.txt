All indexes but one have the same field `field1` and one index has a different field named `field2`. So, in that latter index, I'm defining an alias field `field1` which points to `field2`. My hope is to be able to collapse on `field1` across all indexes, but apparently this doesn't work.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nHere is how to simply reproduce the problem I'm facing. First, we create two indexes:\r\n\r\n    PUT index1\r\n    {\r\n      \"settings\": {\r\n        \"index.number_of_shards\": 1\r\n      }, \r\n      \"mappings\": {\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"field1\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"keyword\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    PUT index2\r\n    {\r\n      \"settings\": {\r\n        \"index.number_of_shards\": 1\r\n      }, \r\n      \"mappings\": {\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"field2\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"keyword\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"field1\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"alias\",\r\n            \"path\": \"field2\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen we index one document in each index\r\n\r\n    PUT index1/_doc/1\r\n    {\r\n      \"field1\": \"test1\"\r\n    }\r\n    PUT index2/_doc/1\r\n    {\r\n      \"field2\": \"test2\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd finally I'm trying to collapse on the \"common\" field\r\n\r\n    POST index*/_search \r\n    {\r\n      \"collapse\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"field1\",\r\n        \"inner_hits\": {\r\n          \"name\": \"hits\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd I get this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"error\": {\r\n        \"root_cause\": [],\r\n        \"type\": \"search_phase_execution_exception\",\r\n        \"reason\": \"\",\r\n        \"phase\": \"fetch\",\r\n        \"grouped\": true,\r\n        \"failed_shards\": [],\r\n        \"caused_by\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n          \"reason\": \"collapse field differ across shards [field1] != [field2]\"\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"status\": 400\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI could not find anything in the documentation or in Github issues that would explain this. One would think that this is indeed possible, but I might be missing something obvious. \r\n\r\nI'd appreciate if anyone could shed some light on this.\r\nThank you so much!","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
