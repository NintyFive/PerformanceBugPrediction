We'd have to add it in our `sources.list` file and upgrading would be even easier than it is now.\n\nI'm not familiar with the amount of work necessary for setting up such a repository, but I'm pretty sure all your Debian and Ubuntu users would be pleased and a few of them might even offer help.\n\nI hope you won't file this in the \"Unfulfilled Promises and Broken Dreams\" [category](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Unfulfilled+Promises+and+Broken+Dreams%22).\n\nThanks a ton for making Elasticsearch et al.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
