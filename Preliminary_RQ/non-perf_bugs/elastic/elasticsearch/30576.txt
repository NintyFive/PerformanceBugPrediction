Be it for describing a particular syntax in a query template or for documenting purposes in the query examples, like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11509875/40003466-b0e15b88-5793-11e8-89e0-8330fc4ba179.png)\r\n\r\nElasticsearch already does a great job of recognizing end-of-line comments in query JSON. But not every editor out there can handle them nicely.\r\n\r\nA `\"_name\"` workaround is usable but not always convenient. At the very least it could blow the response size. And in the worst case I imagine it could hit some unique constraint if there happens to be two identical \"commentary names\" in a query.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to suggest implementing something similar to `\"_name\"` but specifically for commenting purposes. To start with it could even share the same applicability as the `\"_name\"` (i.e. top level of query / filter).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of using `\"//\"` property name for this purpose?\r\n\r\nHere is how the modified example from the above screenshot would look like:\r\n```\r\n  \"aggs\": {\r\n    \"models\": {\r\n      \"terms\": { \"field\": \"model\", \"//\": \"Returns the most popular models of red shirts by Gucci.\" } \r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
