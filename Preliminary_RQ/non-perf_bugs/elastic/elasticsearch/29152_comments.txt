Please use the [X-pack forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/x-pack) so that this can be handled in the right way.\r\n\r\nThat said, I expect the answer will be that custom `CommandMap` implementations are not supported:\r\n\r\n> When ES cluster was in a bad state (single master in test cluster was in heavy GC loop) the transport client could not initialise XPackPlugin due to an incorrect cast in the X-PACK code. We have registered a custom CommandMap called UnmodifiableMailcapCommandMap as can be seen in the logs below.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
