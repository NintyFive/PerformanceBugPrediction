When `rpm -U` is invoked, there are different scenarios. The scenarios come from there being three possible config files: the original config file distributed with alpha1, your config file with edits, and the config file that is distributed with alpha2. In this situation, you have alpha1 = x, your config = y and it turns out that alpha2 = z (there was a change to the shipped config file between alpha1 and alpha2). In this case, rpm assumes that z must be used with the new package (it can not safely assume that either x or y are safe to use with the new package). That is why it will not produce an `rpmnew` here.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/217193569","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18158#issuecomment-217193569","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18158","id":217193569,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzE5MzU2OQ==","user":{"login":"Martin-Logan","id":19209518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjA5NTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19209518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Logan","html_url":"https://github.com/Martin-Logan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Logan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Logan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Logan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Logan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Logan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Logan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Logan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Logan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martin-Logan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-05T15:56:19Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T15:56:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Would it not be better then to produce an rpmold rather than entirely lose the configuration?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/217194327","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18158#issuecomment-217194327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18158","id":217194327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzE5NDMyNw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-05T15:59:05Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T15:59:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Would it not be better then to produce an rpmold rather than entirely lose the configuration?\n\nIt should have produced an `rpmsave`.
