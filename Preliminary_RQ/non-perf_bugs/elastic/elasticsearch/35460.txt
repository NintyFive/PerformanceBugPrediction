version** : `6.x`, `master`\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**: settings for the `.security` index are set to `dynamic: true` for `rules` and `metadata` which can cause conflicts and also cause mapping explosion in case of many rules.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n1. create role mapping:\r\n```json\r\n{\"enabled\": true, \"roles\": [\"superuser\"], \"rules\": {\"field\": {\"metadata.saml\": 12}}}\r\n```\r\n2. attempt to create another role mapping:\r\n```json\r\n{\"enabled\": true, \"roles\": [\"superuser\"], \"rules\": {\"field\": {\"metadata.saml\": \"X\"}}}\r\n```\r\nthis will now fail since a mapping has been created for `rules.field.metadata.saml` in the `.security` index.\r\n\r\nthis is explicitly enabled in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/resources/security-index-template.json#L154\r\n\r\nthe `dynamic` value should be set to `false` for `rules` in the
