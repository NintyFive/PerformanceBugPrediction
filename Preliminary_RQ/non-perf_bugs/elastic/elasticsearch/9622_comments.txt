One is a double and one is a long, but the values for these two fields are stored in the same Lucene field (and the same doc values). \n\nThe result is that your doubles are incorrectly encoded as longs.\n\nWith #8870 we will be enforcing the requirement that fields with the same name in different types in the same index, must have the same mapping.  \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
