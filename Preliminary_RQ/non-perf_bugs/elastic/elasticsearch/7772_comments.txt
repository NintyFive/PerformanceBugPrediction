I've found it annoying that I have to remove params like `fields` etc from the validate-query request, but it does **just** validate the contents of the `query`.\n\nI'd be tempted to ignore all other params and only extract the `query` here.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/58497401","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7772#issuecomment-58497401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7772","id":58497401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDk3NDAx","user":{"login":"robertogyn19","id":2865460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjU0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2865460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertogyn19","html_url":"https://github.com/robertogyn19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertogyn19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertogyn19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertogyn19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertogyn19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertogyn19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertogyn19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertogyn19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertogyn19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertogyn19/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-09T11:44:33Z","updated_at":"2014-10-09T11:44:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, sorry for the delay in responding.\n\nI use this service to validate the query as soon as possible, avoiding unnecessary processing.
