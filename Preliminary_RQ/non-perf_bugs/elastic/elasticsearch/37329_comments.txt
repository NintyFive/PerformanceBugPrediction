This would make sure all new users using the `user_agent` processor directly get ECS data. For backward compatibility reasons I would suggest to introduce a config option `ecs: true` which is true by default. If a user disables it in the ingest processor, he gets the format we had previously. The old format should be deprecated and removed in 8.0.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/458077580","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37329#issuecomment-458077580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37329","id":458077580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODA3NzU4MA==","user":{"login":"simitt","id":5555349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTUzNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5555349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simitt","html_url":"https://github.com/simitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simitt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T10:35:05Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T10:35:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@dakrone could you please reference the PR against master here once it is up.
