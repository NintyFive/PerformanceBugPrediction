#26057 we enabled `set -e` on the scripts. This means we exit if there's an error. For the Debian and RPM integration tests, we extract the contents of the package but do not install Elasticsearch. In the `elasticsearch-env` scripts for the Debian and RPM packages, we try to source `/etc/(default|sysconfig)/elasticsearch`. If we extract the contents but do not install the package, then there is no guarantee that these files exist and thus sourcing would fail. Since we enabled `set -e`, this means the scripts will fail, and the Debian and RPM integration tests will fail. To workaround this, we added a check for the existence of these files thus adding leniency to `elasticsearch-env`.\r\n\r\nThis issue proposes reverting adding this leniency. Instead, we should not be checking the Debian and RPM packages via these means, we should rely on real integration tests where we actually install from the packages and try to start Elasticsearch. We already have this: the packaging tests.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the end game to removing the leniency check is simply removing the integration tests from the Debian and RPM package distributions, i.e., `distribution/deb/build.gradle` and `distribution/rpm/build.gradle`.","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
