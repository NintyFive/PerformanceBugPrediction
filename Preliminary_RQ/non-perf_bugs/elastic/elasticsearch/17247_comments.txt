The option proposed in this issue ie adding an `exclude_templates` parameter which defaults to `.*`\n2. Changing `*` universally to ignore indices beginning with `.`\n3. Making the Kibana template fully explicit, so that nothing can be overridden\n\nThe third option would work today, but it does imply a maintenance burden on Kibana.  The second option I'm concerned about because it touches so many APIs and has the disconcerting effect of making indices disappear, eg:\n\n```\nPUT .my_index\n{ \"settings\": .... }\n\nGET */_settings\n```\n\nreturns\n\n```\n{}\n```\n\nIt'd also mean that request like `GET _cat/indices` would not return hidden indices by default, unless you write it as `GET _cat/indices/*,.*`.  I'm not sure if this change is worth it, just to deal with this case.\n\nI'm leaning towards the first option but am open to further suggestions.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/201329050","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17247#issuecomment-201329050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17247","id":201329050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTMyOTA1MA==","user":{"login":"pickypg","id":1501235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1501235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg","html_url":"https://github.com/pickypg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-25T15:17:16Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T15:41:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think the first option has the ~~most~~least unintended consequences and it's the least likely to impact any existing functionality anywhere.

I think it's appropriate that the way to \"fix\" the problem is to configure the template that created it to begin with, and the logical default would be one that doesn't interfere with how the core products of the stack operate.\n\nKibana does need to move to an explicit mapping sooner rather than later, but I agree with @pickypg on this.
