jpountz for having format my post  ;)\nThanks both for your answers.\n\nI meant it's not possible to ask ES for a JSON like this :\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"aggregations\": {\n        \"prices\": {\n            \"buckets\": {\n                \"0\": {\n                    \"key\": 0,\n                    \"doc_count\": 2\n                },\n                \"50\": {\n                    \"key\": 50,\n                    \"doc_count\": 4\n                },\n                \"150\": {\n                    \"key\": 150,\n                    \"doc_count\": 3\n                }\n            }\n
