This is convenient when setting up multiple instances of ES on the same machine. It would be nice to have a logging equivalent (e.g. es.loggingConfig) to do the same for logging.yml (e.g. \n\nes.config=/etc/elasticsearch/es_master1.yml\nes.loggingConfig = /etc/elasticsearch/es_master1_logging.yml\n\nI know a current workaround is to set the configuration path to be something unique like /etc/elasticsearch/es_master1/ and then place your 'independent' configs in there.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
