I can't speak for everybody but I think it likely that we would be very much against disabling seccomp (\"optional security isn't security at all\").  I think the right way to approach this would be to have a separate OCR service that the ingest plugin can talk to.  That way, Elasticsearch doesn't have to allow forking and it restricts the possibility of exploits to just the OCR service.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/372729173","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17221#issuecomment-372729173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17221","id":372729173,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjcyOTE3Mw==","user":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T16:29:35Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T16:29:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@miguelxpn, the way we are using Tika right now, this is not possible.\r\n\r\nClosing since this is not possible with Tika, but could theoretically be done by spawning a process within a separate Tesseract Ingest Plugin.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
