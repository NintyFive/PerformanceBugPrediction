I'd say we shouldn't do it without defining it through the mapping, since we extend the GeoJSON specification. But thinking of extending the mapping by something like an option `autoclose` this would be neat.\n\n```\n\"area\": {\n    \"type\": \"geo_shape\",\n    \"autoclose\": true\n}\n```\n\nOn the other hand we should go a little further and extend it by a `validation` option (default `true` to keep thinks like they are now), which allows to index arbitrary polygons like self-intersection ones.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/28966459","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4085#issuecomment-28966459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4085","id":28966459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTY2NDU5","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-21T08:50:28Z","updated_at":"2013-11-21T08:50:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
