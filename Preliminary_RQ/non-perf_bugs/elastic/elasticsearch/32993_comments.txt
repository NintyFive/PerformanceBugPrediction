While it is nice to reuse the server cleaner, it will only be a temporary solution. We are heading towards a hard split between the client and the server side, so we will not be able to keep reusing it. However, it might be a good idea to do that at first as it allows us to implement the datafeed APIs while adding tests for them. Then, we can move back the `MlRestTestStateCleaner` and write a client one using the HLRC.\r\n\r\nActually, to avoid the churn in the server side, we can simply duplicate the `MlRestTestStateCleaner` temporarily, then remove it and introduce the HLRC cleaner. That way we don't churn at all the server side.\r\n\r\nI'll go for this approach unless there is a strong downside I missed. Any thoughts @benwtrent , @davidkyle ?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
