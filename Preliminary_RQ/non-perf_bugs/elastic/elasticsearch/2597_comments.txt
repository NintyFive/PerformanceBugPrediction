Its a shame that you feel that way about java, we work very hard to work around the typical reasons why java got some bad vibe (understandably so) in having programs being hard to use, complex, with configuration hell, and those type of things. But, at the end of the day, Java (the JVM) is a very powerful platform to build performant, concurrent, server side projects, and it has the most advance Java information retrieval library out there in Lucene. \n\nAlso it is, first and foremost, it is a server project, not a framework. \n\nI will go ahead and close this..., as it is going to remain in java.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/12787729","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2597#issuecomment-12787729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2597","id":12787729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzg3NzI5","user":{"login":"gfxguru","id":176089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjA4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/176089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfxguru","html_url":"https://github.com/gfxguru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfxguru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfxguru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfxguru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfxguru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfxguru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfxguru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfxguru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfxguru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfxguru/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-28T15:44:46Z","updated_at":"2013-01-28T15:44:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That's a shame..

Note, securing the access to any application is not dependent on a specific language or platform. It is not a question of software alone. It is a question of soft- and hardware architecture, infrastructure, and trust (see \"social engineering\").\n\nYou can set up Elasticsearch on server-side and hide it away behind your firewall or your private networks. As being said Elasticsearch does not rely on Java-specific client access being exposed like in browsers (by applets or sandboxing). \n\nYou can access Elasticsearch with Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Javascript Node.js, Scala, Clojure , .NET ... there are dozens of client implementations out there. The interface is HTTP REST, and there are standard authentication and authorization functions available which can be reused for Elasticsearch access without any restrictions.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
