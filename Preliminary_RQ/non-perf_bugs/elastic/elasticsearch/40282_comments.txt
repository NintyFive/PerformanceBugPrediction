Indeed CAST accepts some ES data types but not all and that's inconsistent, I've got a fix for this already.\r\n2. There are two issues here:\r\n\r\n2a. one that the underlying exception gets propagated without being checked (this is a bug)\r\n2b. not sure whether '0.0' to long should succeed or not since 0.0 is not an int. Basically the command implies two conversions - 0.0 (string to float) and then float to int. Checking quickly indicates that postgres does not support this and I propose we do the same.\r\n\r\nThoughts @astefan @matriv ?\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
