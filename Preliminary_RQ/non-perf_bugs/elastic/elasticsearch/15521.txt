Is there thinking behind why minimum_should_match is ignored when the number of should clauses is lesser than it?\n\nTo be clear, I'm looking for the behavior where the following query returns 0 results:\n\n```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n            \"should\": [{\n                \"match\": {\n                    \"_all\": \"elizabeth\"\n                }\n            }, {\n                \"match\": {\n                    \"_all\": \"smith\"\n                }\n            }],\n            \"minimum_should_match\": 3\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe're using a query-understanding pipeline which should get 0 results from one of the programmatically generated queries if there isn't enough support in the query to make the match. However, that is not currently happening right now.\n\nAny way I can resolve this in the current set up? Or would this be a feature/bug request?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
