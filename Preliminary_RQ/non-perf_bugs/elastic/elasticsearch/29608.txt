This usage differs from the original purpose of Task.getStatus() which is to provide a quick update of the status of potentially very volatile tasks. The persistent task internal state is also shown in the Task API but I think it should only report progression/stats about the tasks here, while the Cluster State API shows the internal state of persistent tasks as it does today.\r\n\r\nWe could decorelate AllocatedPersistentTask.getStatus() from Task.Status by introducing a new PersistentTask.State interface and rename AllocatedPersistentTask.getStatus() to something like lastCommitedState().\r\n\r\n@martijnvg @bleskes @imotov @polyfractal I'd be happy to have your opinion","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
