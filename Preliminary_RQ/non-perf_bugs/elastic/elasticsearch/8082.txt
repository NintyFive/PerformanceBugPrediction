And I've found that they don't work as expected, or even advertised.\n\nLets say i want to aggregate like so:\n\n```\n\"aggregations\": {\n  \"sea_water_temperature\": {\n    \"histogram\": {\n      \"field\": \"sea_water_temperature\",\n      \"interval\": 3\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nResponse buckets looks fine at first glance, but when trying to query for documents within the bounds of a bucket I don't get the same document count as the bucket suggested. E.g.\n\n```\n\"filter\": {\n  \"range\": {\n    \"sea_water_temperature\": {\n      \"lt\": 0,\n      \"gte\": -3\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis could give x results while the bucket \"-3\" had a doc_count of y. This seems to only be an issue for negative bucket keys.\n\nIn the docs for histogram it states that the bucket key for a given value is:\n\n```\nrem = value % interval\nif (rem < 0) {\n  rem += interval\n}\nbucket_key = value - rem\n```\n\nHowever I tried a term aggregation with that as a value script:\n\n```\n\"aggregations\": {\n  \"sea_water_temperature\": {\n    \"terms\": {\n      \"field\": \"sea_water_temperature\",\n      \"script\": \"rem = _value % interval; rem = rem < 0 ? rem + interval : rem; _value - rem\",\n      \"params\": {\n        \"interval\": 3\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat gives me the same kind of bucketing as histogram does but now my filter queries actually match the doc_counts of the buckets(!). Why isn't histogram working as described? or am I missing something?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
