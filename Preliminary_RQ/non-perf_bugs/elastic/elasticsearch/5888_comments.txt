The `term` query takes the term exactly as provided and looks for it in the analyzed text. Your example doesn't find anything because the default analyzer lowercases.  You have two options:\n1. Use a match query. That analyzes the query text and then looks for it. This means lower case searched would find capitals and vice versa. \n2. Use the mapping API to define the letters field as not_analyzed. Now the term query for capitals will find only capitals and lowercase will find only lowercase. \n\nMight be worth adding something else to the docs because I've seen this kind of mistake quite a few times now. \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Apr 20, 2014, at 10:11 PM, Evan Wong notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> ElasticSearch 1.1.0\n> \n> curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/test/test' -d '{\n> \"letters\" : \"ABCD\"\n> }'\n> =>\n> {\"_index\":\"test\",\"_type\":\"test\",\"_id\":\"I8X9z8S9SIahvmv3wFekzA\",\"_version\":1,\"created\":true}\n> \n> curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/test/_search' -d '{\n> \"query\": {\n> \"term\": { \"letters\": \"ABCD\" }\n> }\n> }'\n> =>\n> {\"took\":1,\"timed_out\":false,\"_shards\":{\"total\":5,\"successful\":5,\"failed\":0},\"hits\":{\"total\":0,\"max_score\":null,\"hits\":[]}}\n> \n> â€”\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/41031969","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5888#issuecomment-41031969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5888","id":41031969,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDMxOTY5","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-22T12:10:25Z","updated_at":"2014-04-22T12:10:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Might be worth adding something else to the docs because I've seen this kind of mistake quite a few times now.\n\nSuch as this: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_exact_values_vs_full_text.html\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/41036155","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5888#issuecomment-41036155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5888","id":41036155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDM2MTU1","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-22T13:00:57Z","updated_at":"2014-04-22T13:00:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah!

The curl step is super important because its kind of a lowest common denominator - we can all run the tests. It _should_ work. I mean, we test it on ever compile, but it could be that you've found something very novel.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
