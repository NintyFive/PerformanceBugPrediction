Reject sealing an index if no quorum, too?\n\nI don't think that's a good idea. The worst thing that happens if you do a synced_flush when one of the shards isn't around is that it doesn't effect them. Meaning that shard can't be restored quickly. There isn't really anything that can be done to get that shard to restore quickly regardless because its already offline. I wouldn't want to prevent speeding recovery on the other copies of the shard.\n\nAnd I think its safe because if, by some nasty turn of events, one of the down shards ends up coming back and being the master shard then the synced flush won't have any effect because it won't be on the master.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/119888044","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9126#issuecomment-119888044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9126","id":119888044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExOTg4ODA0NA==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-09T09:28:22Z","updated_at":"2015-07-09T09:28:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kimchy promised to work on this today\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/134138062","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9126#issuecomment-134138062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9126","id":134138062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDEzODA2Mg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-24T10:29:01Z","updated_at":"2015-08-24T10:29:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This wait-for-quorum should be extended to the open-index API, eg see #12987\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/183875620","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9126#issuecomment-183875620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9126","id":183875620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mzg3NTYyMA==","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-14T11:27:55Z","updated_at":"2016-02-14T11:35:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@s1monw In v3.0 we allocate primary shard based on allocation IDs #14739.

The second is that when an index creation successfully returns, there is no guarantee that a follow up indexing operation will not have to wait (maybe not so bad) and that all operations on that index (for example `_analyze`, that needs a shard copy) will succeed. \n- Index Creation puts status to `RED`:\n  Currently `RED` means that a shard has a non-active primary. The idea is to change the semantics to exclude primary shards that were never successfully assigned and also didn't experience any shard failure during assignment. If the allocation deciders block the allocation of primary (not throttle it) we will treat it as a failure and make the shard red as well. In other cases the shard is `YELLOW`.\n- Index Creation should wait or enough shard copies to reach started\n  The index creation call should add the index to the cluster metadata and wait for enough shard copies (typically only primaries, but this should be based on `action.write_consistency`) to be started. It will return immediately if the status of one of those shards becomes `RED` (allocation failure or it can't be assigned to any node), reporting the failure.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/220341958","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9126#issuecomment-220341958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9126","id":220341958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDM0MTk1OA==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T14:30:50Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T14:30:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So now that we're testing snippets in the documentation this user-unfriendliness is leaking into the documentation.
