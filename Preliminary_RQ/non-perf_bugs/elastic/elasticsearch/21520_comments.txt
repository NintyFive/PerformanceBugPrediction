We would also need to consider the serialization format to use. For instance, there are good reasons for Ingest to use `smile` to serialize the source document since it is slightly more efficient, but maybe the size the user is interested in is the `json` size.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/275168494","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21520#issuecomment-275168494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21520","id":275168494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTE2ODQ5NA==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-25T17:08:39Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T17:08:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As per discussion in #21604, we are not going to support it.
