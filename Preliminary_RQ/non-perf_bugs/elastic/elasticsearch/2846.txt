(See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/custom-filters-score-query/)\n\n```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"custom_filters_score\": {\n            \"query\": { … },\n            \"lang\" : \"native\"\n            \"filters\": [\n                {\n                    \"filter\": { … },\n                    \"script\": \"nativescript\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis means that _all_ scripts for the custom_filter_query are in that language. Surely something like this would make more sense to allow the user to combine mvel and native scripts:\n\n```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"custom_filters_score\": {\n            \"query\": { … },\n            \"filters\": [\n                {\n                    \"filter\": { … },\n                    \"lang\" : \"native\",\n                    \"script\": \"nativescript\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively one could nest the `lang` inside the `script` like so:\n\n```\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"custom_filters_score\": {\n            \"query\": { … },\n            \"filters\": [\n                {\n                    \"filter\": { … },\n                    \"script\": {\n                        \"lang\" : \"native\",\n                        \"script\" : \"nativescript\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
