all we're doing is wiping/removing a particular subdir under plugins/ dir, can't we do the remove and install in a single step?\n\nSo instead of doing an uninstall then an install, allow an upgrade that does both in one step.\n\nThere might be some limitation if a plugin is unable to run two different versions on two nodes at the same time, but perhaps a method should be provided for plugin authors to prevent upgrade method and instead force uninstall/install if
