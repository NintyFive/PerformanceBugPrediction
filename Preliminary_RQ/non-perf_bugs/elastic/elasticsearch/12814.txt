Tribe start up is slow, especially for the \"top level\" tribe, which talk with all 30 clusters cross a number of data centers. It would take up to 10 minutes before a tribe node is fully up and ready to answer queries.  The idea is each data center would form its own tribe in order to buffer some of the slowness.  \n2.  Query slowness. Queries are slow when talking to the \"top level\" tribe nodes but may be faster to each data center based tribe.\n3.  When one or more downstream clusters have issues, it affects the whole tribe.  With hierarchical tribe nodes, it will affect some of the tribes but not others.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
