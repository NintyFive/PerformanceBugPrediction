I think there are culprits to check; in my mind SELinux would be the first culprit to check. You could also try installing the Debian package with the environment variable `ES_SKIP_SET_KERNEL_PARAMETERS` set to `true` (if you use `sudo`, keep in mind that environment variables will be lost by default so you have to account for this). Note that this will leave you without `vm.max_map_count` set to 262144, so you should set this manually.\r\n\r\nSince this looks like an environment problem on your end, and Elastic provides a [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) for asking general questions and instead prefers to use GitHub only for verified bug reports and feature requests, I hope that you do not mind if I close this issue. If you do open a post on the forum, please feel free to link to it from here.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
