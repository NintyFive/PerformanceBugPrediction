So one can add `-D` to pass system properties to the test cluster. \r\n`tests.es.*` is used to pass elasticsearch setting and only works with the `run` task and not any test cluster. This was done so that we don't rely on passing in these settings to change the behavior of tests. Ideally we wouldn't have the former either be we need it to test different GC algorithms. \r\n\r\n@pgomulka  is it ok with you to close this issue and open another one  focused on what you are trying to achieve ? I assume sending settings or system properties would be part of some development workflow, but there might be better ways to achieve that.
