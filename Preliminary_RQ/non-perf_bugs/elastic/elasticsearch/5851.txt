This can be a surprising gotcha for new users, who expect that types are as separate as tables in a traditional database.\n\nOne possibility, suggested in #4081, is to prepend the type name to the `index_name` (the name of the inverted index) automatically.  \n\nThis can be done manually now, by specifying a different `index_name` per field, but I'm wondering if it should become the default.  What would be the disadvantages of doing this?  I can think of these:\n- field data would not be shared between types, leading to more memory usage\n- you wouldn't be able to query the `foo` field across all types in an index, instead you'd have to query `*.foo`\n\nThe upsides are:\n- different mappings would not clash\n- different field data data types would not clash\n- term frequencies would be preserved per type\n\nI'm guessing that most of the time, fields with the same name in different types usually represent the same \"thing\", and so would be mapped in the same way, which leads me to think that we should leave things as they are, and allow users to use the `index_name` to configure this manually where needed.\n\nAny thoughts?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
