For an integer or long field, when coerce is true and a float value is indexed, Elasticsearch will truncate the value to make it a int/long value. If you don't want Elasticsearch to index float values for your integer/long fields then you should set coerce to false and the index operation will fail instead. If you want to index and use the field as a floating point value then you should use the float/double/half_float/scaled_float field type in your mapping\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/number.html\r\n[2] https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/coerce.html","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/351671818","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27810#issuecomment-351671818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27810","id":351671818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTY3MTgxOA==","user":{"login":"zjjott","id":3733548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzM1NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3733548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjjott","html_url":"https://github.com/zjjott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjjott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjjott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjjott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjjott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjjott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjjott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjjott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjjott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjjott/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-14T10:31:13Z","updated_at":"2017-12-14T10:31:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@colings86 Thank you very much!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
