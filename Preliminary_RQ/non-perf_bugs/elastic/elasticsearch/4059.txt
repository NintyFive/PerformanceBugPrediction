Right now the only option is to query against it is to compute it and explicitly store it in my source document. E.g. I'm syncing my docs from mongodb with a river and would like to boost using the length of an array in the document, but I have to update all my docs in mongodb with the array length in order to do that. I would rather be able to have elasticsearch compute and store the field so that I do not have to update my docs in mongodb.\n\nI've seen others asking for this as well:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/elasticsearch/computed/elasticsearch/ro187eatzIo/lTrl4sFSJqoJ\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
