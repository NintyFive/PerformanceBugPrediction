However, using the source filtering returns following error to me.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10341430/19214302/2c4a8924-8d9d-11e6-88af-ba838a879c97.png)\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Follow examples mentioned on the above mentioned url for creating index with mapping and indexing document.\n2. Use following query for the suggestion\ncurl -XPOST \"http://localhost:9200/music/_suggest\" -d'\n{\n    \"_source\": \"completion.*\",\n    \"song-suggest\" : {\n        \"prefix\" : \"nir\",\n        \"completion\" : {\n            \"field\" : \"suggest\"\n        }\n    }\n}'\n\n**Looking at the documentation, i also wonder why to use completion.\\* as my source filtered field. Shouldn't it be the name of the field which exist in the document??**\n\n_Surprisingly there is no exception thrown in Elasticsearch log file._\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
