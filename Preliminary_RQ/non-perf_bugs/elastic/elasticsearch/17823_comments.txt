Just like in the processor factories we always throw an error with the the processor tag, processor type and property name present. I think we should do the same for exceptions being thrown at ingest preprocess time and then instead of fetching tag and type from current processor in `CompoundProcessor` we extract that information from the exception itself.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/211964733","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17823#issuecomment-211964733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17823","id":211964733,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTk2NDczMw==","user":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-19T14:57:41Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T14:57:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am aware of this issue.
