If there are many of those rivers elasticsearch's startup essentially hangs: all threads in the 'listener' pool are used by the `RiversService#createRiver()` method, and the listener for the 'indexExists' call never gets executed.\n\nA full thread is available at https://gist.github.com/ankon/e000198100ce3d52cb3b#file-thread-dump-txt, and the issue is filed also in the elasticsearch-river-mongodb project: https://github.com/richardwilly98/elasticsearch-river-mongodb/issues/406\n\nSome questions:\n1. What is the proper behavior of a river inside `#start()`, in particular: is it allowed to use the elasticsearch client? Should it do anything special when invoking methods on it?\n2. Where is the best place for documenting these requirements?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
