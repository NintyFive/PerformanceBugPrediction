Running the same query string against several \"default\" fields can be done by combining them either with bool or disMax queries, but its cumbersome.\n\nqueryString should support providing a \"fields\" field, where a list of fields the query will run against will be provided. An option to choose if the query will be combined using disMax or bool should be a simple flag. A tieBreaker field allowed when using disMax.\n\nSample 1:\n\n```\n{\n    queryString : {\n        fields : [\"content\", \"name\"],\n        useDisMax : false,\n        query: \"test\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSample 2:\n\n```\n{\n    queryString : {\n        fields : [\"content\", \"name\"],\n        useDisMax : true,\n        query: \"test\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBoosting per field should be allowed, for example:\n\n```\n{\n    queryString : {\n        fields : [\"content^1.4\", \"name\"],\n        query: \"test\"\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
