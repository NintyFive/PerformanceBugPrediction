*believe* this has happened during the back port of #21964 and only relates to the yet to be released 5.3.0 \r\n\r\nHere's the logic of the delete operation (it's the same both on master and 5.x):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static Engine.DeleteResult executeDeleteRequestOnPrimary(DeleteRequest request, IndexShard primary) throws IOException {\r\n        final Engine.Delete delete = primary.prepareDeleteOnPrimary(request.type(), request.id(), request.version(), request.versionType());\r\n        return primary.delete(delete);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how it doesn't do any version conversion for replicas.\r\n\r\nOn master, this is done in `TransportShardBulkAction#executeBulkItemRequest`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase DELETE:\r\n    final DeleteRequest deleteRequest = (DeleteRequest) itemRequest;\r\n    Engine.DeleteResult deleteResult = executeDeleteRequestOnPrimary(deleteRequest, primary);\r\n    if (deleteResult.hasFailure()) {\r\n        response = null;\r\n    } else {\r\n        // update the request with the version so it will go to the replicas\r\n        deleteRequest.versionType(deleteRequest.versionType().versionTypeForReplicationAndRecovery());\r\n        deleteRequest.version(deleteResult.getVersion());\r\n        deleteRequest.setSeqNo(deleteResult.getSeqNo());\r\n        assert deleteRequest.versionType().validateVersionForWrites(deleteRequest.version());\r\n        response = new DeleteResponse(request.shardId(), deleteRequest.type(), deleteRequest.id(), deleteResult.getSeqNo(),\r\n            deleteResult.getVersion(), deleteResult.isFound());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.x doesn't have that logic in the same method, but rather relies on handling in the execute*OnPrimary method. Here is the relevant code from the index variant:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if (result.hasFailure() == false) {\r\n            // update the version on request so it will happen on the replicas\r\n            final long version = result.getVersion();\r\n            request.version(version);\r\n            request.versionType(request.versionType().versionTypeForReplicationAndRecovery());\r\n            assert request.versionType().validateVersionForWrites(request.version());\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need to go through the backport again and make 5.x do what master does.\r\n\r\nPS. This is yet another proof unit tests are *badly* needed for this. @dakrone has already [started](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/23024) working on it.\r\nPPS. Areek is working on making this [entire thing less messy](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/23038).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
