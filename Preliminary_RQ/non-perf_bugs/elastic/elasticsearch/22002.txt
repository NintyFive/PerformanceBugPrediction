If the replica that is promoted resides on a node with a higher ES version than what's on nodes with other replicas, the newly promoted primary might use a new postings format or codec that is not available on the replication target nodes.\r\nPreventing a primary to be on a node with a higher version than nodes with replicas is currently done using an allocation decider (`NodeVersionAllocationDecider`). Allocation deciders are only checked though when a primary or a replica is allocated / moved, not when a replica is promoted to primary.","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
