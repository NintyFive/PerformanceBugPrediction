See `IndexFieldType#termQuery` and `IndexFieldType#wildcardQuery` for details.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to go further and handle these in `TermQueryBuilder#rewrite` and `WildcardQueryBuilder#rewrite`. The benefit is that if someone queries index `foo` with a filter on `{ \"term\": { \"_index\": \"bar\" } }`, then the top-level query will rewrite to a `MatchNoDocsQuery`, which is exactly the information that the `can_match` phase leverages in order to skip shards.\r\n\r\nIt would be a convenient and efficient way for Kibana to filter on a subset of data streams that are configured in the index patterns.","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
