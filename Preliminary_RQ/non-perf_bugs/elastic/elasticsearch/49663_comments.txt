We chatted about this today in our team meeting and decided not to implement this feature request.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we decided it is mostly a cosmetic improvement for the user, but would have an additional maintenance burden for us.  There wouldn't be any performance improvement because most values need to be computed anyway (e.g. sum of squares, variance, etc are used for other calculations).\r\n\r\nAs far as responses go, it isn't too large of JSON response to work with, and `filter_path` can be used to prune elements if you want, so we don't think the cosmetic improvement is worth the maintenance tradeoff in this case.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feature request though!\r\n\r\nAs an aside, the `percentiles` aggregation has that syntax because internally the percentiles are represented by an \"opaque\" data sketch.  If we could return the full cumulative probability chart to the user without any selection criteria, we would.  But the sketch works by asking for certain percentiles and it approximates those.  So we have to have the user provide which percentiles they are interested in so we can interrogate the sketch.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
