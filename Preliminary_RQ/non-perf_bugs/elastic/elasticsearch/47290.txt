I want to normalize the scalar product when ranking.\r\n\r\nI will explain in simple words, and then add a little bit of mathematics. Suppose we have 2 search results. One search result was generated for the query `Pupkina Sons`, and the second - for the query` Sons Pupkina`. Then we have the output:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocument_0, score_0\r\ndocument_1, score_1\r\ndocument_2, score_2\r\n...\r\ndocument_p, score_p\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssue for the second request:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocument_0, score_0\r\ndocument_1, score_1\r\ndocument_2, score_2\r\n...\r\ndocument_q, score_q\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet score_0 for the first issue is 500. And score for the second issue is 0.5. ** Task ** is required to be able to compare the scores of different issues and evaluate the relevance to each other.\r\n\r\nDefault ranking function, as I know, is dot product. For example, we have vector for query (v) and vector for documents (d_i). For ranking, we make (q, d_i) for all i, where (., .) -- dot product. Please, explain me, how I can calculate (q / |q|, d_i / |d_i|)? I think it possible three solves of my problem. \r\n\r\n* function_score. Can I get weight (tf-idf) into function_score?\r\n* getting all weights by API elasticsearch. Flag `explain` is not valid solve, because this is so long. Another case, this is bad solve as explain return intersection (q and d_i tokens). Notice: While now, I say about dot product, in the future, I want calculate euclidean distance.\r\n* normalize elastic search weights by default ","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
