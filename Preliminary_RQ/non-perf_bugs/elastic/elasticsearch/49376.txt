The following statements are true, as well:\r\n  - It is the first week with a majority (4 or more) of its days in January.\r\n  - Its first day is the Monday nearest to 1 January.\r\n  - It has 4 January in it. Hence the earliest possible first week extends from Monday 29 December (previous Gregorian year) to Sunday 4 January, the latest possible first week extends from Monday 4 January to Sunday 10 January.\r\n  - It has the year's first working day in it, if Saturdays, Sundays and 1 January are not working days.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- January 1st, 2005 was on a Saturday. According to Gregorian calendar, it's week 1 of year 2005. According to ISO standard, it's week 53 of year 2004 because the first week of 2005 starts on Monday, January 3rd.\r\n- December 31st, 2007 was on a Monday. According to Gregorian calendar, it's the last week of year 2007. According to ISO standard, it's week 1 or year 2008 because it starts on Monday and because most of its days are in January.\r\n\r\nIn case of ES SQL, we have:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ISO_WEEK_OF_YEAR(CAST('2005-01-01T00:00:00Z' AS DATETIME)) isow2005, WEEK(CAST('2005-01-01T00:00:00Z' AS DATETIME)) AS w2005, ISO_WEEK_OF_YEAR(CAST('2007-12-31T00:00:00Z' AS DATETIME)) isow2007, WEEK(CAST('2007-12-31T00:00:00Z' AS DATETIME)) AS w2007\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich results in \r\n\r\n```\r\n   isow2005    |     w2005     |   isow2007    |     w2007     \r\n---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------\r\n1              |1              |53             |1              \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it should have resulted in `53              |1              |1             |53        `","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
