This issue will introduce task management API that will provide a mechanism for communicating with and controlling currently running tasks. The task management API will be based on the top of existing TransportAction framework, which will allow any transport action to become a task. \r\n\r\nThe tasks will maintain parent/child relationship between tasks running on the coordinating nodes and subtasks that are spawn by the coordinating node on other nodes.\r\n\r\nThe task management will be introduced in several iterations. The first phase will be back-ported to 2.x and the second phase will be only available in 5.0.\r\nPhase I\r\n- [X] #15347 Create framework for registering and communicating with tasks. \r\n- [X] #16033 Make the Task object available to the action caller\r\n- [X] #15931 Establish parent/child relationship for master node, replication and broadcast actions\r\n- [X] #16320 Add support for task cancellation\r\n- [X] #16356 Add a task status field to the task info object\r\n- [X] #16586 Add wait for task registration to testCanFetchIndexStatus\r\n- [X] #16744 Combine node name and task id into single string task id\r\n- [X] #16829 Store and report task start time and duration\r\n\r\nPhase II\r\n- [X] #17383 Add Task Management API Documentation\r\n- [X] #17551 Add cat API version of task management APIs\r\n- [X] #17928 Provide a generic mechanism for storing results of long running tasks\r\n- [x] Add ability for a task to survive restart of coordinating node\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
