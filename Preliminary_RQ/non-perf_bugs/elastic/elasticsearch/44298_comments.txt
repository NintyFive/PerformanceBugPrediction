have the same issues with multi `fields` and `copy_to` targets. `copy_to` is hard to address since multiple source fields can have the same target, but maybe we could have a solution that also addresses the issue with multi `fields` by returning the path of the field in the `_source` document, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"indices\" : [ \"index1\", \"index2\" ],\r\n  \"fields\" : {\r\n    \"alias_field\" : {\r\n      \"keyword\" : {\r\n        \"type\" : \"keyword\",\r\n        \"searchable\" : true,\r\n        \"aggregatable\" : true,\r\n        \"source_path\": \"concrete_field\"\r\n
