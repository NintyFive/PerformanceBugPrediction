I understand what happened now. My change changed the order in which filters are applied in aliases sometimes, and I had to accomodate one test for that. The problem is that the failing 7.1 and 7.0 jobs didn't have my change yet and tested against a 6.7 cluster that had the change already. I pushed at about the same time on 6.7, 7.0 and 7.x so I believe this only affected jobs that were waiting in the queue. I'll wait for at least one green build on each branch and then revert the commit that disables the test.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/494297251","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40838#issuecomment-494297251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40838","id":494297251,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDI5NzI1MQ==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-21T08:39:53Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T08:39:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I had reverted in d6637eefb3b197d905e1d0024e2d77d3322e2dde and 7c27e5f243098d4251b865a7ac89636d874491f9 but then forgot to close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
