The `_id` field does not use utf-8 encoding internally which breaks the unified highlighter. We'll remove the `_id` field when `required_field_match` is false in order to avoid this issue. I hope you don't mind if I close this issue,  we'll update #37525 when a fix is ready.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/459709255","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38170#issuecomment-459709255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38170","id":459709255,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTcwOTI1NQ==","user":{"login":"arthurdarcet","id":973454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/973454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurdarcet","html_url":"https://github.com/arthurdarcet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurdarcet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurdarcet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurdarcet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurdarcet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurdarcet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurdarcet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurdarcet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurdarcet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arthurdarcet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-01T12:36:16Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T12:36:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ok.
