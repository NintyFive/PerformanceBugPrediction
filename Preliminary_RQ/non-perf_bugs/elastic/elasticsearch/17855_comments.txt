For community support of Shield, we use our [discuss forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/shield) rather than the ES/Kibana github repos.  (Commercial support comes directly through our support team for our paying customers).  I'm going to close this issue here, but feel free to open this or other topics on discuss if my below answer isn't satisfactory.\n\nFor this particular issue, there does appear to be a documentation gap in the Shield privileges documentation.  The fine-grained privileges you listed often caused confusion and warranted a re-evaluation.   I've let the team know about the documentation gap, so thanks for reporting this!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
