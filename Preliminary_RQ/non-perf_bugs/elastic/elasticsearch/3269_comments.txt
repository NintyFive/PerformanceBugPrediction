As for the java clients, these parameters are exposed as methods in the builders, so they don't need to be exposed externally. Indeed, this comes with a price of double checking there are no typos, but in most cases, these literals are only checked and used in the parsers. Like with @Paikan suggestion above, it's all about finding the right balance and carefully considering the pros/cons of each approach and in many of the cases we base the decisions on experiments (I tried to move a lot of these param names to constants in the past and the code became much less descriptive and harder to read).
