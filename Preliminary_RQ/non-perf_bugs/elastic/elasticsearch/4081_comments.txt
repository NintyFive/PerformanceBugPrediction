And because those IDs are used throughout our architecture (relational databases, protobufs, etc), making changes to either field names or field types creates a lot of friction in our codebase.\n\nPlease consider storing fully-qualified field names for all top-level and nested types (\"user.id\" is a different field from \"item.id\" or \"user.address.id\"). The extra few bytes of storage a small price to pay for eliminating ambiguity in mapping and faceting.\n\nFor anyone depending on the current behavior (multiple logically-distinct fields consolidated into a single lucene field), it might be possible to provide an option (similar to the [copy_to](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-core-types.html#copy-to) param) that lets them continue consolidating field data even when ES default behavior is to use fully-qualified field names.\n\nOr maybe the [Create Index API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html) could provide an option for choosing between a new \"unambiguous fully-qualified-field-name indexing\" vs the current behavior.\n\nJust a thought :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/35000538","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4081#issuecomment-35000538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4081","id":35000538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDAwNTM4","user":{"login":"benjismith","id":458075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODA3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/458075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjismith","html_url":"https://github.com/benjismith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjismith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjismith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjismith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjismith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjismith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjismith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjismith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjismith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjismith/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-13T17:06:29Z","updated_at":"2014-02-13T17:06:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley Is there any reason you prefer \"foo:bar.baz\" instead of just \"foo.bar.baz\" for fully-qualified field names?
