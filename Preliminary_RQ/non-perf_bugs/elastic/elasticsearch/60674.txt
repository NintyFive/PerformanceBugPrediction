We have decided to implement this as a special metric aggregation with a scope limited to only `date_histogram` aggregation at the moment, in other words, the `rate` aggregation will have to be a descendant of a `date_histgram` and in the case of nested histograms the closest ancestor will be used to determine the rate. \r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /sales/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"aggs\": {\r\n    \"sales\": {\r\n      \"date_histogram\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"date\",\r\n        \"calendar_interval\": \"day\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"aggs\": {\r\n        \"the_rate\": {\r\n          \"rate\": {\r\n            \"unit\": \"second\" \r\n          } \r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"aggregations\": {\r\n    \"sales\": {\r\n      \"buckets\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"key_as_string\": \"2020-07-29\",\r\n          \"doc_count\": 300000,\r\n          \"the_rate\": {\r\n            \"rate\": 3.47222222222,\r\n            \"rate_as_string\": \"3.47222222222/s\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n       ...\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default the number of documents in the bucket will be used to calculate the rate, but it will be also possible to specify a numeric field to use sum of all values of the field to calculate the rate:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      \"aggs\": {\r\n        \"the_rate\": {\r\n          \"rate\": {\r\n            \"field\": \"num_of_requests\" \r\n            \"unit\": \"second\" \r\n          } \r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could also add support for `\"accumulative\" : true`  flag to address #60619 in a future iteration.","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
