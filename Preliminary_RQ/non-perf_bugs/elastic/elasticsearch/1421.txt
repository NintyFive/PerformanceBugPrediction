Sometimes, not all of it is needed to be stored, and the ability to include / exclude parts of it is needed. The `_source` mapping should support `includes` and `excludes` array options, specifying which part of the document are to be stored. The format allows to do things like: `path1.*`, `path1.*.path2` using `*` as a wildcard. Here is an example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"my_type\" : {\n        \"_source\" : {\n            \"includes\" : [\"path1.*\", \"path2.*\"],\n            \"excludes\" : [\"pat3.*\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
