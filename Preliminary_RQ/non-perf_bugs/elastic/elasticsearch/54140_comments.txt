In-place updates are not possible in Lucene and the principle of immutable files is central to its design which has given us such a fast search capability.\r\nSo in many respects costly nested updates is a known \"issue\" and one I've tried to document this vs parent/child docs using [this flowchart](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/a-question-on-whether-to-use-a-nested-datatype/208394/4)\r\n\r\nIf you have a detailed suggestion on how we can make fast search AND cheap updates I can re-open this issue but otherwise I'm afraid I'll have to close this as \"working as designed\".","performed_via_github_app":null}]
