When using bulk output in logstash, it sends:\nPOST /_bulk HTTP/1.1\nhost: bar01\nconnection: keep-alive\ncontent-length: 856\n{\"index\":{\"_id\":null,\"_index\":\"bla\",\"_type\":\"gelf\"}}\n{\"version\":\"1.0\",\"host\":\"foo\",\"short_message\":\"11-Dec-2014 07:17:00:011\",\"level\":5,\"facility\":\"xxx\",\"@version\":\"1\",\"@timestamp\":\"2014-12-11T07:17:00.000Z\",\"source_host\":\"1.1.1.1\", <snip>,\"logstash_processor\":\"bar0\",\"tags\":[\"_grokparsefailure\"]}\n\nand gets this when rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index: false in the config (when the option is set to true, the bulk index succeeds):\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 101\n{\"error\":\"ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException[explicit index in bulk is not allowed]\",\"status\":400}\n\nI see in the history that https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commit/dfdf269a3f3f72fdfece7614975d6c596df68f0d was submitted as a fix, however I am wondering if we don't reach this throw in line 301 of src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/bulk/BulkRequest.java in master branch:\n\nwhile ((token = parser.nextToken()) != XContentParser.Token.END_OBJECT) {\n  if (token == XContentParser.Token.FIELD_NAME) {\n    currentFieldName = parser.currentName();\n  } else if (token.isValue()) {\n    if (\"_index\".equals(currentFieldName)) {\n      if (!allowExplicitIndex) {\n        throw new ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException(\"explicit index in bulk is not allowed\");\n      }\n    index = parser.text();\n    ...\n\nI will check if I can workaround it as maybe it's not possible to remove the exception at this point of the function without breaking the purpose of the allowExplicitIndex boolean.
