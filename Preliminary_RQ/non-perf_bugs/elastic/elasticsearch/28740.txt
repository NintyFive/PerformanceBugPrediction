Actually, this example comes from [The Definitive Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/partial-updates.html) (which I know it's WIP), but still the ES API should reply back with an error for such a command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /website/blog/1/_update\r\n{\r\n  \"script\": \"ctx.op = ctx._source.views == params.count ? 'delete' : 'none'\",\r\n  \"params\": {\r\n    \"count\": 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returns:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"_index\": \"website\",\r\n  \"_type\": \"blog\",\r\n  \"_id\": \"1\",\r\n  \"_version\": 2,\r\n  \"result\": \"noop\",\r\n  \"_shards\": {\r\n    \"total\": 0,\r\n    \"successful\": 0,\r\n    \"failed\": 0\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDebugging this with `Debug.explain(params)` shows that there is no `params` registered. Which, in fact, is fine since the syntax is incorrect: there shouldn't be any `params` definitions at the root level, but inside `script` itself. The correct syntax should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /website/blog/1/_update\r\n{\r\n  \"script\": {\r\n    \"source\": \"ctx.op = ctx._source.views == params.count ?
