In the future, please ask your questions there. The community over there is very helpful.\n\nAs a hint though, your problem is that the `name` field is analyzed but the filter looks for the exact term. You probably want to use a match query instead. This works perfectly fine:\n\n```\nGET _search\n{\n   \"query\": {\n      \"bool\": {\n         \"must\": {\n            \"match\": {\n               \"name\": \"James\"\n            }\n         },\n         \"filter\": {\n            \"term\": {\n               \"age\": 30\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nYou can read more about [match queries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/query-dsl-match-query.html) and [term queries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/query-dsl-term-query.html) in the docs.\n\nClosing as this is not a bug.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/173205155","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16119#issuecomment-173205155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16119","id":173205155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzIwNTE1NQ==","user":{"login":"HarishRamanathan","id":8604703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDQ3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8604703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarishRamanathan","html_url":"https://github.com/HarishRamanathan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarishRamanathan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarishRamanathan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarishRamanathan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarishRamanathan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarishRamanathan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarishRamanathan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarishRamanathan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarishRamanathan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HarishRamanathan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-20T13:35:34Z","updated_at":"2016-01-20T13:35:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@danielmitterdorfer Thanks for helping with this. \n\nSorry, wasn't aware about the discussion forum.
