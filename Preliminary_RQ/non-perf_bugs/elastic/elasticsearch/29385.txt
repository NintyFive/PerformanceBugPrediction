This will make it much easier to have Kibana show data that is more static in nature.\r\n\r\nRight now its possible to achieve the same by selecting top hits, settings the size to one and adding a filter to make sure the field exists but it would be easier to have a last known value option.\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\nI'm polling a piece of equipment at a certain interval. This data is static in nature and I want to sort of re-create the equipment web interface in Kibana by showing the last known data for certain fields.\r\n\r\n**Colums and rows**\r\nIt would also be great if it was possible to set rows and columns in metric visualizations. Right now if you add a lot of fields things become unreadable and ugly fast. \r\n\r\nIf its possible to set the amount of rows and columns it would make showing static data much prettier.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
