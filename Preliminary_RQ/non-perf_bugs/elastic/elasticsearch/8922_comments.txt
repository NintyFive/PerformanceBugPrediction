You win this time!\n\nJust to register my original objection to this, as someone who uses it in practice, you may include headers a few times learning the APIs, but the vast majority of time you don't want headers.  They're optimized for the busy admin who needs answers quickly, piping to this and that, etc.  He or she already knows the columns, especially because a lot of times they're adding `?h=foo,bar` in order to widdle it down to what they want.  Now it's a mandatory `&v=false` that has to be added as well.\n\nIt's unfortunate with many unix commands how the cryptic headers are turned on by default. You have to visit the manpage anyway to figure out what they mean, you can also easily figure out how to turn on the headers there too, but for the rest of the time you're adding options to turn them off even after you've learned it.  Your tool shouldn't punish you with more typing the better you learn it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/71866374","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8922#issuecomment-71866374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8922","id":71866374,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODY2Mzc0","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-28T16:32:57Z","updated_at":"2015-01-28T16:32:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">  They're optimized for the busy admin who needs answers quickly\n\nI agree! But when I admin I usually am running these locally/manually, when I want to script I usually have more time and can add the `?v=false` in a script/chain.\n\nAlso, I think scripts **should** be using `?v=false` _regardless_, in order that any change in behavior does not change them, instead of relying on the default.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
