This means that when a relocation target is needed (e.g., [in `TransportReplicationAction`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/3b192cfc7488a02387501a598fe177234d4149ae/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/support/replication/TransportReplicationAction.java#L851)) we have to create the target relocation shard object. Instead, if `IndexShardRoutingTable#activeShards` included relocation targets, that could be cached and we can simplify places where the relocation target is needed.\n\nRelates #15791 via a [comment](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/15791/files#r48978243) from @bleskes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
