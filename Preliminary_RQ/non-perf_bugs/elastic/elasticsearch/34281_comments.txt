The reason I say this is because our build are green right now, so this failure is likely environmental. In particular, you likely have a mix of elasticsearch 5 and 6 jars, which could cause an error like this. We'd like to direct these kinds of things to the forums. If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/427099474","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34281#issuecomment-427099474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34281","id":427099474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzA5OTQ3NA==","user":{"login":"william8000","id":1887814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODc4MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1887814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/william8000","html_url":"https://github.com/william8000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william8000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william8000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william8000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william8000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william8000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william8000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william8000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william8000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/william8000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-04T17:16:27Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T17:16:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for suggesting a mix of versions. I removed elasticsearch 6 with dnf, and then I ran `find / -name '*elasticsearch*'`, and I still had elasticsearch 5 files in `/usr/share/elasticsearch`. I removed that directory and re-installed elasticsearch 6, and it is working now! I just need to update my application for the api changes.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
