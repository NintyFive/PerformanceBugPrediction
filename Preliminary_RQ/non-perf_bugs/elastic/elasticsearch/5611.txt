We built a new cluster for 1.0.1 (yes, we will upgrade to 1.1.0 soon) but we experience this problem that I would like help with. All 16 nodes are identical and all are master eligible.\n\nIn our 0.90.5 cluster, we had it configured as:\n\n``` yaml\n  discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 9\n  gateway.expected_nodes: 16\n  gateway.recover_after_nodes: 12\n```\n\nBut when we built the 1.0.1 cluster with the same settings, all the nodes return 503 when upon startup after checking status http://localhost:9200.\n\nHad to turn that down as below to get it working and return 200 status as usual.\n\n``` yaml\n  discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 1\n  gateway.expected_nodes: 16\n  gateway.recover_after_nodes: 1\n```\n\nFull elasticsearch yaml configs for both clusters are: https://gist.github.com/ppat/9791741\n\nThis (https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/4007) talked about renaming `minimum_master_nodes` but from the last comment it sounds like it was decided against doing that and [documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery-zen.html#master-election) still refers to it as it was named in 0.90.5, so I'm assuming it didn't change and this is a real issue. \n","closed_by":{"login":"ppat","id":1630635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA2MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1630635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppat","html_url":"https://github.com/ppat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppat/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
