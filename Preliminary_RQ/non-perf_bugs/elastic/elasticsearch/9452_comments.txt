The primary is on A, the replica on B.\n\nThen I use the REST interface to send bulk requests to node B.  B has to forward these requests to node A (via the transport layer).  A indexes the documents, then replicates the actions to node B.  A then returns the responses to B, which returns the responses over the REST layer to the client.\n\nMy tests showed the following:\n\n```\nA:\n    \"rx_size\": \"12.2mb\",\n    \"tx_size\": \"2.1mb\",\n\nB:\n    \"rx_size\": \"2.1mb\",\n    \"tx_size\": \"12.2mb\",\n```\n\nThis is consistent with what we'd expect. (Remember that only the transport layer is measured, not the HTTP layer.)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/71837110","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9452#issuecomment-71837110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9452","id":71837110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODM3MTEw","user":{"login":"satishmallik","id":8112171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTIxNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8112171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishmallik","html_url":"https://github.com/satishmallik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishmallik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishmallik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishmallik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishmallik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishmallik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishmallik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishmallik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishmallik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishmallik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-28T13:50:11Z","updated_at":"2015-01-28T13:50:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have the following setup,\n3 Query Nodes\n3 master nodes\n3 data nodes\n\nAll indexing requests come to query nodes which is also acting as ingestion node.\n\nI am looking data in marvel and am seeing this weird behavior.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
