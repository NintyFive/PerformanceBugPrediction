I have it configured so the http is enabled on a random port, and then I use the rest api for my tests.  \n\nI am currently running a test that uses the inner hits functionality and I have found that one of my asserts on the index name of an inner hit fails.  After inspecting the json response, I can see that the _index key on the inner hit is missing.  Every time it fails it looks like the test framework has sets a test locale that result in non-english text in the logs.  I don't know if that has anything to do with it or not, however, this is the only consistent thing I have noticed.\n\nThe inner hits are only against nested documents and the request that fails has multiple levels of nested objects.  All levels of the nested response are missing the _index key.  My search request is only using the top-level inner hits request structure since I need multiple levels of inner hits.\n\nI know there has been changes to inner hits lately so I am not sure this is even relevant in versions greater than 2.2. \n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:  \n\nhttps://gist.github.com/mattweber/614e45ce0ab9a0487400fa69400a4131\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
