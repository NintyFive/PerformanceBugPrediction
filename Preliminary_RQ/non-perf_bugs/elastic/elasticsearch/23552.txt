It seems to evaluate as CONSOLE instead and where there is no PUT, POST, GET, etc in the console-text the copy link does nothing. [An example is the first curl call for getting elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html#_installation).\r\n\r\nSuggested solutions:\r\n\r\n- [The first console in the following link](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_exploring_your_data.html#_loading_the_sample_dataset) uses NOTCONSOLE and expands into an incorrect curl-call. It probably instead should be edited to use PUT and GET with the CONSOLE-tag instead.\r\n- The other usages of NOTCONSOLE are not needed it seems.","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
