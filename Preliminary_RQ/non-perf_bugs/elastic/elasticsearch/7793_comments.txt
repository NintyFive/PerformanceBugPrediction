Its behaviour was lenient and not configurable, meaning that the parameter was just being ignored. This api was inconsistent given that its behaviour didn't support our common multi indices options (neither `ignore_missing` nor `ignore_unavailable`) and its default was different from the other api (lenient instead of strict).\n\nThe only thing we could technically do is keep the inconsistent default and make it lenient if no parameters are specified, but that would mean that the get indices api, the single api that rules them all, would need to have a different behaviour only when returning aliases? That doesn't really make sense to me.\n\nThat said, I see this as a bugfix which ended up changing the default behaviour of the aliases endpoint, which is now strict instead of lenient, but configurable. If the fact that the change is breaking we should maybe consider taking the get indices api as a whole out of `1.x`?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/56864041","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7793#issuecomment-56864041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7793","id":56864041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODY0MDQx","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-25T18:41:06Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T18:41:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Given that the `GET _aliases` is a widely used API, and this change does break bwc, I suggest we keep it lenient for 1.x (ie default `ignore_unavailable` to `true`), but deprecate this, and change the behaviour in master.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
