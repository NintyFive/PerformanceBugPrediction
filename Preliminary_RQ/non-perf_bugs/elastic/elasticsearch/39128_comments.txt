I guess we could just put the logic for marking the timestamp of the last read in `org.elasticsearch.transport.TcpTransport#inboundMessage` and log if we get anything long-running there. At least all the problems/deadlocks that we ran in so far as well as #39658 should've been caught by that.\r\n\r\nThat said :tada: #39729, that's already gonna be very helpful. Still, I think it would be great having this in production too since last week alone I looked into two separate production issues that showed weird latencies in the network and that would've been much easier to debug with a warning for blocking on the IO thread.\r\n\r\n> and a long GC would trigger this.\r\n\r\nIs this a problem though? I mean either this is super rare and can be correlated to GC warning logging anyway when investigating or if it's frequent then the cluster/node is in trouble regardless and it really isn't all that bad, imo. I don't really see much of a downside to getting some (sort-of) false positives here?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/470360731","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39128#issuecomment-470360731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39128","id":470360731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDM2MDczMQ==","user":{"login":"tbrooks8","id":862472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjQ3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/862472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrooks8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T02:38:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T02:38:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Still, I think it would be great having this in production too since last week alone\r\n\r\nSounds like this would be good to discuss.
