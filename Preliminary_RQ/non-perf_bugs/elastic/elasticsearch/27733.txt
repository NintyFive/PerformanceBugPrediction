Allowing arbitrary values as booleans is asking for silent mistakes like misspelling 'false'. However, the values 1 and 0 (or exact strings \"1\" and \"0\") are widely used or accepted as booleans in many programming languages, and for example in Perl and SQL are a generally used form of boolean since the languages have no native booleans. I don't feel that it would cause any of the same issues as the previous lenient booleans if these exact values were additionally allowed, and it would be convenient for instances where one is using various components with different boolean representations, in the case where '0' and '1' are the only representations that can be transparently used across all systems.","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
