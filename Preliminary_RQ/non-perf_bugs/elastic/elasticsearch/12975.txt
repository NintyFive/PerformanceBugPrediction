It would be nice to have something like a /_cat/clusters API for tribe nodes to return the list of clusters the tribe node know about.  Also good to know those that are connected and healthy vs those that are not connected/not healthy.\n\nI am currently using /_cat/nodes?h='h,i,n' and look in node name for node name that has a '/' in it to figure out the tribe cluster it is in.\n\nFor example: 'lva1-app1234.prod_tribe/galene-tribe_ela4' mean that the tribe put it in the galene-tribe_ela4 cluster.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
