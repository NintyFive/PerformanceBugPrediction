We tend to bounce our clusters quite often so it'd be great to be synced as much as possible, and for the indexers that are running every minute the 5 min auto-sync is too long. For now I am thinking of adding a curl to perform the synced flush in the indexer script (they're cronned short-lived processes), but being able to use the Java client API would have met our needs better.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
