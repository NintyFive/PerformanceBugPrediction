If you are highlighting a field that only contains names though, you'd want to disable the ability to have back multiple fragments and just highlight a single fragment containing the whole text. You can achieve this by using `\"number_of_fragments\": 0` (supported by all highlighter implementations).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/42510079","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5947#issuecomment-42510079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5947","id":42510079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTEwMDc5","user":{"login":"roytmana","id":2524911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjQ5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2524911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana","html_url":"https://github.com/roytmana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-08T03:26:55Z","updated_at":"2014-05-08T03:26:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Many thanks @javanna I missed in docs.
