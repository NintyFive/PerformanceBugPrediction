We work on ElasticSearch 1.3.4. and have a very big set of data. \n\nOur completion field is configured as follows:\n_suggest_company_by_name: {\nmax_input_length: 50\npreserve_separators: true\npayloads: true\nanalyzer: simple\npreserve_position_increments: true\ntype: completion\n}\n\nExample of how we index:\n_suggest_company_by_name: {\ninput: [\nTrailburning\n]\noutput: Trailburning\npayload: {\ncompany_identifier: 9f3974f8f10c4028b6ec2ccfcc67aaa6\n}\n}\n\nWe query the data as follows:\n{\n        \"name\" : {\n            \"text\" : \"<partial text>\",\n            \"completion\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"_suggest_company_by_name\",\n                \"fuzzy\" : {},\n                \"size\" : 10,\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nWe experience the following problem. When entering a partial text (in this case a company name), there is a point where the partial text is already so specific it should respond with the exact name from the dataset matching it, but instead it gives results which are different. \n\nExample 1:\nI search for the name 'Travel Rhythm'. As partial text I enter 'Travel R', but the system responds with the names 'Travel Distribution Systems', '1travel.gr' and 'Travel Agent CMS' (which obviously match with the 'Travel' part, but not with 'Travel<space>R'. Not untill the partial text is 'Travel Rhy' I get 'Travel Rhythm' as only result. \n\nExample 2\nI search for the name iLost. As partial text I enter 'iLost' but the system responds with 'iGost Technologies' and 'iLastic'. Not untill I add a space in the partial text (so 'iLost<space>') I see 'iLost' in addition to the previous results.\n\nWhat steps can we take to solve this? Thank you for your suggestions.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
