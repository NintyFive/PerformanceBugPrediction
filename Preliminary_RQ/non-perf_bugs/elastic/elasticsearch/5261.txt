As of now, all existing plugins lack the property which means the default ES settings will be applied.\nES provides a new setting, `plugin.isolation` which indicates the behaviour to use for plugins that do not specify any isolation. By default this would be true but can be changed to false to revert to the default / 1.0 behaviour.\n\nBy enabling isolation out of the box, we theoretically prevent any clashing problems regarding the classpath and at the same time, keep a close eye on problematic plugins. If they appear, folks can turn off `plugin.isolation` (by setting it to false) or simply cherry pick the problematic plugin and configure no isolation for it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
