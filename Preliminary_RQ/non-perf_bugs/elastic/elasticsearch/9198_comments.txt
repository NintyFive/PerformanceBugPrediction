Bintray makes it all pretty easy with gradle and their upload plugin.\n\nI opened this ticket primarily to see what you think about jcenter (assuming everybody already knows jcenter/bintray) and because I'm in the process of revamping an outdated river plugin which I would like to distribute trough a repo once I'm done (instead of having to manually download and install a zip file). Since I'm already using bintray and am happy with them I figured having their repo supported too would be nice.\n\nIn a wider context: gradleware does all their new community-plugins management via bintray. They have a repo and every user can apply to have their gradle plugin included in their repo. They'll then show up at [http://plugins.gradle.org/](http://plugins.gradle.org/) and can be used from the build script without having to add a repo or anything. It's a pretty neat way to allow users to easily publish their own plugins and make them available to the world.\n\nI've never used ES before and maybe you already have something similar like the gradle guys do. I only scrolled trough the ES docs today and may have skipped over that part. If not, a similar approach to community plugins might liven up your plugin ecosystem and make it more accessible to plugin writers?\n\nJust a few thoughts. But I'd be happy if you'd simply support the jcenter repo. The rest may be something for the longer term.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/69551692","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9198#issuecomment-69551692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9198","id":69551692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTUxNjky","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-12T10:31:45Z","updated_at":"2015-01-12T10:31:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@stackmagic Thanks for the suggestion.
