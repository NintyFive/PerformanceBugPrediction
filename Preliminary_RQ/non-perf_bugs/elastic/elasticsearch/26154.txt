The importance of this environment variable has increased starting in 6.0.0 as it's now used consistently to ensure Elasticsearch and all secondary scripts (e.g., `elasticsearch-keystore`) all use the same configuration. The name `CONF_DIR` is there for legacy reasons yet it's too generic. This issue proposes renaming `CONF_DIR` to `ES_PATH_CONF` for 6.0.0. This would be a breaking change but it's a smaller break now than it would be in the future after this environment variable becomes baked-in through the ecosystem.","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
