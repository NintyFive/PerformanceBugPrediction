basic support for hunspell stemming. Hunspell dictionaries will be picked up from a dedicated hunspell directory on the filesystem (defaults to _<path.conf>_/hunspell). Each dictionary is expected to have its own directory named after its associated locale (language). This dictionary directory is expected to hold both the *.aff and *.dic files (all of which will automatically be picked up). For example, assuming the default hunspell location is used, the following directory layout will define the _en_US_ dictionary:\n\n```\n- conf\n    |-- hunspell \n    |    |-- en_US\n    |    |    |-- en_US.dic\n    |    |    |-- en_US.aff\n```\n\nThe location of the hunspell directory can be configured using the `indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.location` settings in _elasticsearch.yml_.\n\nEach dictionary can be configured with two settings:\n- `ignore_case` - If true, dictionary matching will be case insensitive (defaults to `false`)\n- `strict_affix_parsing` - Determines whether errors while reading a affix rules file will cause exception or simple be ignored (defaults to `true`)\n\nThese settings can be configured globally in `elasticsearch.yml` using `indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.ignore_case` and `indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.strict_affix_parsing`, or for specific dictionaries: `indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.en_US.ignore_case` and `indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.en_US.strict_affix_parsing`.\n\nIt is also possible to add `settings.yml` file under the dictionary directory which holds these settings (this will override any other settings defined in the `elasticsearch.yml`).\n\nOne can use the hunspell stem filter by configuring it the analysis settings:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"analysis\" : {\n        \"analyzer\" : {\n            \"en\" : {\n                \"tokenizer\" : \"standard\",       \n                \"filter\" : [ \"lowercase\", \"en_US\" ]\n            }\n        },\n        \"filter\" : {\n            \"en_US\" : {\n                \"type\" : \"hunspell\",\n                \"locale\" : \"en_US\",\n                \"dedup\" : true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
