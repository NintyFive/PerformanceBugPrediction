However, in 7.0 there seems to be no simple way for clients to distinguish these two cases, and it would be useful to do so. For example:\r\n\r\n- a per-node health check should verify the node-level property of cluster membership, but may not be interested in the cluster-wide property of whether all the primaries are assigned.\r\n\r\n- an orchestrator may wish to wait for a freshly-started node to join a cluster before performing some followup actions, again without caring about whether all the primaries are assigned. Today this often happens by waiting for the HTTP port to be open, but this is unreliable: if no master is discovered within `discovery.initial_state_timeout` (default 30s) then we open the HTTP port anyway.\r\n\r\nIn the 6.x series a node responds to `GET /` with `503 Service Unavailable` if it believes there to be no master (i.e. either `NO_MASTER_BLOCK_*` or `STATE_NOT_RECOVERED_BLOCK` is present), which allows these cases to be distinguished. However #29045 changes this in 7.0 so that we will always respond `200 OK` to `GET /` (as is right and proper) so another mechanism is needed.\r\n\r\nI think we should expose the presence or absence of these blocks in the output to `GET _cluster/health` and add the ability to wait for their absence, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    GET _cluster/health?local&wait_for_discovered_master\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
