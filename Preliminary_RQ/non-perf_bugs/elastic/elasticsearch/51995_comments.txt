alias template feature is superseded by data streams (#53100) and index templates v2 (#53101).\r\n\r\nThe main reason behind is that aliases are not a first class concept in Elasticsearch. Alias templates requires a lot of knowledge about ES in order to get started with ingesting time-based data (aliases, alias templates, and write aliases). Data streams will be a first class way to interact with time based in Elasticsearch. The data stream design as stand currently will not include any configuration. The ability to explicitly compose templates will be implemented via index templates v2.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
