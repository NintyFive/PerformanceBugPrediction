discussed this during FixItFriday. Reindex from remote should keep on using `ObjectParser`, but we should write a subclass for it (PartialObjectParser) that allows to parse partial messages. We parse what we know about and ignore the rest. Obviously this new subclass should only be used in special cases like reindex from remote, not for parsing requests where we still want to be strict and barf whenever we get something that is not supported.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
