For eg. `PkiRealm` authenticates users based on the client presented certificate. In turn, the identified username could be used to query group information from an external LDAP server. Another eg. would be for `KerberosRealm` where after user authentication we might want to use external LDAP server to fetch group information.\r\n\r\nWe have a chain of authentication realms which get invoked during the authentication process based on the request attributes. Current realms support `lookupUser()` for that particular realm used during `runAs` user impersonation. We can invoke this lookup user from the realms who want to depend on other realms for user information.","closed_by":{"login":"bizybot","id":902768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjc2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/902768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot","html_url":"https://github.com/bizybot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
