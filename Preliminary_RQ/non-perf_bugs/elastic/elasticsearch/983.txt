But both of them end up being considered as true so the results give back the \"true\" docs.\nQuerying with `0`, `off` or `false` works as intended... but those values aren't terms!\n\nThe doc should be more precise and say something like:\n\n> For `string` fields, the term is taken as is (**not analyzed**),\n> whereas it is analyzed for numeric, date and boolean types\n> to match the internally equivalent terms in the index.\n> In particular, you should not search for `T` or `F` for boolean queries,\n> but you should use the regular values (`0`,`1`,`on`,`off`,`true`,`false`) instead.\n\n  [1] http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/term-query.html\n  [2] http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/core-types.html\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
