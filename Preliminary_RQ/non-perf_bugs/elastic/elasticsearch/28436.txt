A 3 nodes ES cluster, original path.data is [/home/data1, /root/data2]. Original disk size is about 100G\r\n 2. Add a 2T hard disk. change path.data to /home/data3 (which is the mount path of new hard disk)\r\n 3. when change the path data, I did one by one. Stop 1/3 ES service, change path data config, restart ES, wait until cluster status to green.\r\n 4. after change pathdata, the data usage become very large. (5G used, 101 available) before, (95G used, 1.6T available) after. It looks like the rate keeps 5% ?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6340346/35550045-927b17c8-05c3-11e8-9f8e-5dba202f8513.png)\r\n\r\nmy size of data doesn't change at all.
