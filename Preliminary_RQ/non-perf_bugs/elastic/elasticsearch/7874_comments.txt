This meant that if the matching field defined a null_value, we would not index the null_value for any documents that come in until we get the first document with a non-null value. To fix this I have added an attempt to parse the null value as a dynamic field when we don't have a concrete mapping defined yet.\n> \n> The issue with this comes when the dynamic template defines `{dynamic_type}` placeholder(s), we won't know what type the field is supposed to be since it's value in the input doc is null, so we have nothing sensible to replace this placeholder with.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/59079915","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7874#issuecomment-59079915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7874","id":59079915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDc5OTE1","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-14T17:03:53Z","updated_at":"2014-10-14T17:03:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@colings86 Yep, that is indeed a problem.
