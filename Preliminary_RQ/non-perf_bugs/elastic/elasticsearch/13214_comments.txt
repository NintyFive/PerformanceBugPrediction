The reason for it is that `_all:*` and `foo:*` get rewritten as different queries:\n\n```\nGET /test*/_validate/query?explain\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n      \"query\": \"*\",\n      \"default_field\": \"_all\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nreturns:\n\n```\n\"explanation\": \"ConstantScore(*:*)\"\n```\n\nwhile:\n\n```\nGET /test*/_validate/query?explain\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n      \"query\": \"*\",\n      \"default_field\": \"foo\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nreturns:\n\n```\n\"explanation\": \"ConstantScore(cache(BooleanFilter(_field_names:foo)))\"\n```\n\nThe latter translates to \"return all documents that have any value in field `foo`\".\n\nFor this query `*` it seems right to match all documents. For the `foo:*` query, it feels right to return documents that have a value in field `foo`.  However, in your example with query `*` which is rewritten to `foo:*`, we're doing the unexpected... Perhaps the rule should be: \"if a wildcard is specified without a field: prefix, then match all docs\"\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/136459462","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13214#issuecomment-136459462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13214","id":136459462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjQ1OTQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"jimmyjones2","id":2991805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTE4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2991805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2","html_url":"https://github.com/jimmyjones2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmyjones2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-31T18:40:36Z","updated_at":"2015-08-31T18:40:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @clintongormley.
