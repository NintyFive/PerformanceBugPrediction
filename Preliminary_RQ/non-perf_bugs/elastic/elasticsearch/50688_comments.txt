Here's an example for the pagination section you referenced:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/43007/files#diff-84f64183bb03317ed998fc0e9ddd5c79L133\r\n\r\nThe `[float]` attribute kept each heading + section on the same page. When removed, each section was moved to its own page. \r\n\r\nRe-adding the `[float]` tags should make 6.8 (and other versions) consistent with 6.7. If wanted, I can work on re-adding those attributes.\r\n\r\nI'm also going to move this over to the elastic/elasticsearch repo as I don't believe it relates to the docs build but rather implementation in the source files.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/571344725","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50688#issuecomment-571344725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50688","id":571344725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTM0NDcyNQ==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T22:31:43Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T22:31:43Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-docs (:Docs)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/571344728","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50688#issuecomment-571344728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50688","id":571344728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTM0NDcyOA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T22:31:44Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T22:31:44Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-search (:Search/SQL)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
