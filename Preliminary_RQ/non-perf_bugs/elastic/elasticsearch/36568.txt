If java is not installed, but being installed in a single transaction, rpm does not know how to order those two and thus may attempt to install elasticsearch before java is installed and ready.\r\n\r\nThis results in a failure in the PREINST scripts which check for the presence of the java binary. Simply attempting a re-install after java was installed clears the issue, but does complicate automated installations.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nDon't have java installed. Attempt to install the elasticsearch RPM using `rpm` or `yum` along with the java package in one command. This *may* trigger the issue, but might not, as it's dependent on the way rpm decides to order those. Installing those two along with a heap of other packages *may* help trigger it.\r\n\r\n**Suggested fix**\r\n\r\nAdd \"java\", or \"jre\" to the `Requires` list in the RPM spec file. If it must be \"Java 8\", then use \"java-1.8.0\" or \"jre-1.8.0\". Those capabilities are given in the \"Provides\" section of both Oracle java RPMs and OpenJDK RPMs.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**: Not relevant\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
