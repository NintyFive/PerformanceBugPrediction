Naming an API key was a nice to have feature but got preemptively built with constraints like it being unique across active API keys.\r\n\r\nThe current design does not guarantee this behavior as when we create an API key we do not `refresh` index immediately (the default is `wait_for`) and so it is not available when creating another API key with the same name where the request arrives before the refresh.\r\n\r\nGiven that we are now using API keys across the board for various use cases like Cloud, Hadoop, Fleet, Alerting, etc. we need to think whether we want to continue with this constraint.\r\n\r\nAs far as I remember the comment was to have a named API key but whether it should be unique across API keys was something that we decided runtime as I could not find/remember any discussion around it.\r\nAlthough minor another possible problem to keep into consideration is the indexing/creation speed that gets impacted due to this constraint.\r\n\r\nThis issue exists to discuss the following:\r\n- Do we think the constraint of unique API key name is of value?\r\n- If not can we remove this constraint? so the name can be considered as a tag.\r\n- If yes do we want to refresh immediately(as default) after indexing new API key document?","closed_by":{"login":"bizybot","id":902768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjc2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/902768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot","html_url":"https://github.com/bizybot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
