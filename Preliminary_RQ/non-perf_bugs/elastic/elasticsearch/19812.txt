This model made sense to me, as it expressed pretty much exactly what I wanted -- a string where the entire contents of the string is the \"term\" (in ES/Lucene terminology).\n\nThe name chosen to call the `keyword` feature feels wrong, to me. \"United States\" is two words. \"San Jose Sharks\" is three words. \"www.google.com\" is a network address with 3 parts. For all of these examples, I have wanted to do terms aggregations or similar operations which require the whole text to be considered a single term. Under this new `keyword` label, these things which have multiple parts are all now called a singular `word` and that very much confuses me.\n\nAs a note, I understand the `keyword` type uses only the `keyword` tokenizer, and that we may say that because of this, `keyword` is the correct name for the type. My counter to this is that the `keyword` tokenizer is incorrectly named for the same reason.\n\nCan we change the `keyword` to something that may better reflect what it is?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jordansissel","id":131818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTgxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/131818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansissel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
