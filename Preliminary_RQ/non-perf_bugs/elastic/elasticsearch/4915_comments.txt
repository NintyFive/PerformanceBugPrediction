So weird things may happen like the first term of the 2nd page having a higher count than the last element of the first page, etc.\n\nRegarding your question, terms aggregations run in two phases on the shard-level: first they compute counts for every possible term, and then they pick the top `shard_size` ones. Increasing `size` (or `shard_size`) only makes the 2nd step more costly. Given that the runtime of the first step is linear with the number of matched documents and that the runtime of the 2nd step is `O(#unique_values * log(shard_size))`, if you only have a limited number of unique values compared to the number of matched documents, doing the paging on client-side would be more efficient. On the other hand, on high-cardinality-fields, your first approach based on an exclude would probably be better.\n\nAs a side-note, `min_doc_count` has no effect on runtime performance when it is greater than or equal to 1. Only `min_doc_count=0` is more costly given that it requires Elasticsearch to also fetch terms that are not contained in any match.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/37372551","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4915#issuecomment-37372551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4915","id":37372551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MzcyNTUx","user":{"login":"haschrisg","id":6199237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTkyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6199237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haschrisg","html_url":"https://github.com/haschrisg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haschrisg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haschrisg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haschrisg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haschrisg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haschrisg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haschrisg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haschrisg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haschrisg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haschrisg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-12T03:35:35Z","updated_at":"2014-03-12T03:35:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jpountz would storing the results of an aggregation in a new index be feasible?

There may be tens of thousands unique terms by which we group, and gather statistics by subaggregations. It can be sorted by any of these subaggregations, so it's gonna be very costly anyway, but its speed with ES is currently more that bearable as well as its precision, and if not sending such big json data between servers and holding it with PHP (which isn't good at all as for now), it would be fine.
