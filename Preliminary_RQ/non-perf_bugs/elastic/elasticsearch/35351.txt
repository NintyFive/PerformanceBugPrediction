The expected return within this context changed from ```def (Object)``` to ```Double```.  This causes an issue with casting as it is illegal to cast from one boxed type to another.  This means that scripts previously were allowed to do the following where ```value``` is a ```def``` representing ```double```:\r\n\r\n```value > 0 ? value : 0```\r\n\r\nThis previous script allowed the auto-return mechanism to cast ```0``` to ```Integer``` and return that since ```def``` was the expected return type.  Now this will cause a ClassCastException because casting from ```Integer``` to ```Double``` is not allowed in Painless or Java (included as we follow a casting model very similar to Java's).\r\n\r\nMy recommended fix is to have this context return ```Object``` for now until we can come up with a better solution for deprecation.  Note that if this context didn't require ```null```, it would be okay to use ```double``` since it's legal to cast from ```int``` to ```double``` as unboxed types.\r\n\r\nThis started in version 6.5 and was caught by a Kibana script using a similar example to the one given.\r\n\r\nping @original-brownbear @rjernst ","closed_by":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
