I suggest you try asking this on the [Elasticsearch forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch). This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
