In talking to Jason Tedor at the Elastic ON Tour event in Toronto last week, he told me I had to pass -XX:-MaxFDLimit on MacOS. This should be in the public documention. Iâ€™ll submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. start up elasticsearch with the default settings\r\n 2. try to import a year's worth of nginx logs via filebeat and logstash. The daily shards will need about 18,000 file descriptors\r\n 3. watch elasticsearch run out of memory\r\n 4. increase kern.maxfiles via /etc/sysctl.conf but see that elasticsearch cannot use the extra file descriptors unless you also pass the JVM option -XX:-MaxFDLimit\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
