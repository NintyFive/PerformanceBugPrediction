This pattern will just include a format or the name of the pattern, but never the `8` prefix - which it has to include.\r\n\r\n**Update**: I ran a quick test by properly returning `8$FORMAT` in the xcontent response and it worked flawless. We may need to check this in cases like the dynamic date formats as well.\r\n\r\nWe could possibly change the `JavaDateFormatter` to always prepend `8` in its `pattern()` method.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/462749616","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38567#issuecomment-462749616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38567","id":462749616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Mjc0OTYxNg==","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-12T12:59:12Z","updated_at":"2019-02-12T12:59:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"closed by #38712","performed_via_github_app":null}]
