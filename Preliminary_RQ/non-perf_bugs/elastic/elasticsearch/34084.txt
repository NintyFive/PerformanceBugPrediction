Job memory usage is store in the job configuration and is updated periodically during the job's run when a model size stats doc is emitted by autodetect. This can lead to frequent job config updates (cluster state updates) particularly so for historical look-back jobs.   \r\n\r\n1. Consider moving the job's established memory usage from the config as it is a result of the job running not part of it's setup. \r\n2. Consider alternative methods go gather the open job's memory usage and make that information trivially available to the code making the allocation decision. \r\n\r\nThis is pertinent to the job config migration project #32905 where the job's memory usage is not available in the cluster state during the allocation decision. A temporary work around was implemented in #33994 basing the decision on the job count rather than memory usage.","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
