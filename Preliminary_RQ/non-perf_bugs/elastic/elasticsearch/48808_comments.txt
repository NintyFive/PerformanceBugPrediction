Therefore, if we want to fail the job creation, we'd have to hardcode the fields listed above in the job creation code (Java). This introduces duplication between C++ and Java as now every new field emitted by C++ code would have to be copied to the field name blacklist in Java.\r\n@dimitris-athanasiou: Please LMK if you think such a duplication is acceptable (at least as a short-term remediated for this bug).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/564487483","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48808#issuecomment-564487483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48808","id":564487483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDQ4NzQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"przemekwitek","id":19312454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzEyNDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19312454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek","html_url":"https://github.com/przemekwitek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T10:53:40Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T10:54:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As of https://github.com/elastic/ml-cpp/pull/861 the check is done in C++","performed_via_github_app":null}]
