That said I think you see this because you are sending via REST what gets generated through `SearchSourceBuilder`, is that right? If you use the Java API, you are one step ahead compared to other clients, parsing doesn't happen as you are already providing the parsed objects that will be sent around using the transport layer, hence it doesn't matter what the json representation of what you send is. That is why I don't expect this to be a problem in the Java API, but only in case you use SearchSourceBuilder to generate json that you then sent via REST layer. I'd appreciate if you can confirm this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/266424707","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20969#issuecomment-266424707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20969","id":266424707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjQyNDcwNw==","user":{"login":"arosenheinrich","id":5214937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTQ5Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5214937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich","html_url":"https://github.com/arosenheinrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-12T12:57:03Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T12:57:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Indeed we are using the REST API here.
