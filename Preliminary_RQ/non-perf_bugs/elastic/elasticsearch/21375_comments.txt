We considered list.remove(int) to be the more common use case here.  This was a deemed a reasonable solution given the added complexity and performance hit at runtime for overloaded method look up.\n\nAs for not being allowed to make a new Integer call, Painless attempts to hide boxing from the user if at all possible.  If you really need an Integer you can use Integer.valueOf(int), but it should be quite rare if ever necessary.\n\nLastly, we can add shortcuts, but += and -= are already overloaded for so many different use cases it would be very difficult to add them as those.
