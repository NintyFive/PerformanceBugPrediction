In fact, this is what Kibana does as well.  The field stats request is very fast, so I believe that Kibana doesn't cache the results but issues a fresh call before each search request (I may be mistaken here though).\n\nSorry, but i don't want to further complicate the already complicated search API by adding more options for what is essentially sugar.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/152473405","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14301#issuecomment-152473405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14301","id":152473405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjQ3MzQwNQ==","user":{"login":"pjcard","id":8281121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyODExMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8281121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjcard","html_url":"https://github.com/pjcard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjcard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjcard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjcard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjcard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjcard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjcard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjcard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjcard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjcard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-30T09:37:28Z","updated_at":"2015-10-30T09:37:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @clintongormley,\n\nThanks for your reply. On reading about it, it was a slight surprise to me that the implication of it was that the default way to use elasticsearch has changed to making two RESTful calls, instead of one; or to put it another way, that the only part of the process of searching that has to be performed separately is the initial step of ascertaining which indices should be queried. (Given that it is fast, could it be applied implicitly based on the search DSL, instead? Or explicitly as a filter without options?)\n\nIn any case, thanks for the response. The information is much appreciated.\nPaul\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
