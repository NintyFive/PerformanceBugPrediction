I'm presenting an issue that has been sitting on the mailing list for a while without attention, I think that I've found a highlighting issue when a field has a \"large\" number of fragments, specifically edge ngram fragments.\n\nI have a gist that easily reproduces the issue. When attempting smaller hashes with the same analyzer, the highlight result is what I would expect. It's only when using longer hash strings that this issue occurs. Sorry if this is just a misunderstanding of how to use the highlighter, but, it certainly seems to be a bug. Thanks very much for looking into this issue.\n\nRepro gist: https://gist.github.com/jonpaul/d4a9aa7f9c8741933cf5\n\n[Edits:]\nThis issue was verified on the mailing list, here: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/elasticsearch/DeC5JXqY78M\n\nI think a realistic, simple solution would be to make that property (MAX_NUM_TOKENS_PER_GROUP) configurable, so that users can specify unusually large numbers if they believe their system is capable of handling it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
