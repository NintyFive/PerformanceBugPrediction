Create a subfield of type object and specify `dynamic: true` for it. When creating a new object field under the dynamic one, it gets a different dynamic default depending on whether it was added via put mapping api (apparently taken from the main dynamic behaviour of the type) or dynamically created through index api (`true`, maybe ok because it was created dynamically). I would expect the new field to get the same default regardless of how it got added in the first place. I am not sure if its default value should be taken from the type of from its ancestor field.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n- Create the index\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/index1 -d '{\n    \"mappings\": {\n      \"strict_type\": {\n        \"dynamic\": \"strict\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"dynamic_field\": {\n            \"dynamic\": \"true\",\n            \"type\": \"object\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n}'\n```\n- Add a new field under `dynamic_field` using the put mapping api:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9200/index1/strict_type/_mapping -d '{\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"dynamic_field\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                  \"subobject\": {\n                    \"type\" : \"object\"\n                  }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n'\n```\n- Retrieve the mapping and verify that `subobject` gets the default dynamic behaviour of the type.\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9200/_mapping?pretty\n\n{\n  \"index1\" : {\n    \"mappings\" : {\n      \"strict_type\" : {\n        \"dynamic\" : \"strict\",\n        \"properties\" : {\n          \"dynamic_field\" : {\n            \"dynamic\" : \"true\",\n            \"properties\" : {\n              \"subobject\" : {\n                \"type\" : \"object\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n- Also try and index a document with a new field under `subobject`, it gets rejected due strict mapping:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/index1/strict_type/1 -d '{\n    \"dynamic_field\" : {\n        \"subobject\" : {\n              \"field2\" : 123 \n        }\n    }\n}\n'\n\n{\"error\":\"StrictDynamicMappingException[mapping set to strict, dynamic introduction of [field2] within [dynamic_field.subobject] is not allowed]\",\"status\":400}\n```\n- Index a new document containing a new subobject field under `dynamic_field`:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/index1/strict_type/1 -d '{\n    \"dynamic_field\" : {\n        \"subobject2\" : {\n        }\n    }\n}\n'\n```\n- Retrieve the mapping and verify that `subobject2` has `dynamic` set to `true`, omitting its `dynamic` behaviour\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9200/_mapping?pretty\n\n{\n  \"index1\" : {\n    \"mappings\" : {\n      \"strict_type\" : {\n        \"dynamic\" : \"strict\",\n        \"properties\" : {\n          \"dynamic_field\" : {\n            \"dynamic\" : \"true\",\n            \"properties\" : {\n              \"subobject\" : {\n                \"type\" : \"object\"\n              },\n              \"subobject2\" : {\n                \"type\" : \"object\",\n                \"dynamic\" : \"true\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
