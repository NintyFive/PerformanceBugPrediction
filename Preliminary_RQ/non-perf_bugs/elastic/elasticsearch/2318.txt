Some users content are moved to their own index when becoming too big.\n\nFrom the client perspective we don't know if we are manipulating a virtual index via an alias or a real index dedicated to the user and the code should be the same. So if an user is deleted and we want to remove its content the client code do something like curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/$INDEX_NAME. The power of aliasing being that the client is agnostic of knowing if it deals with a real index or an aliased one.\n\nBut with the current behavior if $INDEX_NAME is an alias the whole big oversharded index will be deleted and all users document are lost!\n\nIMHO it is really dangerous. I was expecting a simple delete index if the $INDEX_NAME is a real index under the hood and maybe a delete by query (even if it is expensive) or at least a failure or something like that maybe configurable via a parameter if $INDEX_NAME is an alias linking to the big oversharded index.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
