So need to figure out how to refactor this whole thing or maybe create some custom base initializers to avoid data clean up after each test. \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/600959112","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53598#issuecomment-600959112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53598","id":600959112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDk1OTExMg==","user":{"login":"aleksmaus","id":872351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjM1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/872351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus","html_url":"https://github.com/aleksmaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-19T02:48:08Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T02:48:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After conversation over zoom agreed on moving this to qa rest tests, and improve the naming convention for tests.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/601918384","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53598#issuecomment-601918384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53598","id":601918384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTkxODM4NA==","user":{"login":"aleksmaus","id":872351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjM1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/872351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus","html_url":"https://github.com/aleksmaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-20T21:28:33Z","updated_at":"2020-03-20T21:28:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing as done.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
