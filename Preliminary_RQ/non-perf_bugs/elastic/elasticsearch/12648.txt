However,  some results did not result a highlight field.  When i checked those docs, i noticed that all of them have the words \"monkey\" and \"business\" in reserve order.  In another word, all those docs that didn't return a highlight have the word \"business\" appear before \"monkey\".  \n\nIf the match phrase query with slop is matching words regardless of position, shouldn't the highlight also follow that?
