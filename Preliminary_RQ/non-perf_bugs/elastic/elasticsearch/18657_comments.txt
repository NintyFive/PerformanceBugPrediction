In my case, I need to suggest hotels by name, and I have several cases:\n1. Suggest hotel name that's found by current search\n2. Suggest hotel by selected area\n3. Suggest hotel by selected city\n4. More combinations possible in future\n\nCurrently I added all these parameters as separate categories to one suggest field. If we do like you proposed, I'll need to create separate suggest fields to every usage case. Other workaround in my case would be to add just one category with values like \"city-1234\", \"area-4321\", etc., by it seems to eliminate category idea.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/234240539","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18657#issuecomment-234240539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18657","id":234240539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDI0MDUzOQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-21T12:37:13Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T12:37:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sergbass in 5.0 the completion suggester has been completely rewritten and supports the functionality you suggest\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/374315643","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18657#issuecomment-374315643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18657","id":374315643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDMxNTY0Mw==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T18:22:51Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T18:22:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The completion suggester has been rewritten in 5 and the same recreation would now yield to no result.
