of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\nThis is a documentation issue about OpenID realm not showing  `authorization_realms` setting support.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nIn the  [security settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/security-settings.html#ref-oidc-settings), the `authorization_realms` setting is missing from the Open ID connect realm.\r\nI do see the setting 4 times for the following realms: SAML, LDAP, PKI and Kerberos.\r\nThis implies this `authorization_realms` setting is not valid for OpenID realm hence authorization delegation is not supported.\r\n\r\nHowever the [role mapping page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/oidc-role-mapping.html#oidc-role-mapping) shows this setting is in fact supported.\r\n\r\n- Could we add edit the [security settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/security-settings.html#ref-oidc-settings) to add documenation about `authorization_realms` setting for OpenID?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lockewritesdocs","id":25848033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODQ4MDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25848033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs","html_url":"https://github.com/lockewritesdocs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
