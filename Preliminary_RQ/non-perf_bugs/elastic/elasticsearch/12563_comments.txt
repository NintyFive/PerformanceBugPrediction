Weird that it has taken this long for this issue to show up for the first time.\n\nI was going to put it up as a bug to be fixed, but then I remembered this change that we're planning for 2.0: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12394\n\nThe `analyzed`/`not_analyzed` setting will be replaced by splitting the `string` type into `text` and `keyword` types, where `keyword` fields are not analyzed by default, but WILL support analyzers (as long as the tokenizer is  `keyword`).\n\nSo it will be acceptable to set an analyzer on a `keyword` field, which means this particular issue doesn't need fixing.\n\nthanks for the good recreation.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
