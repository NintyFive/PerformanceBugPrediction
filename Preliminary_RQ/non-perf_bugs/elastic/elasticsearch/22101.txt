When elasticsearch 5.1.1 was upgraded and I tried to start it, Elasticsearch did not start but in the STDOUT it never gave a failure. Instead, in STDOUT it gave an OK message wwhich signifies that elasticsearch has started succesfully.\r\n\r\n**Problem Issue Identification**\r\nAfter debugging it, I found the issue causing it by traversing through the /var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log file. The issue was caused by using elasticsearch-head plugin which was installed in ES-2.3.3 but as it is not supported in ES-5.1.1, elasticsearch failed to start.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behaviour**\r\nAs an end-user I think we should not get an OK message if elasticsearch fails to start and it should be mentioned in the Installation of Elasticsearch documentation (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html).\r\n\r\n**Note: This issue will occur for every plugins which were earlier supported prior to ES-5.0.x version.**\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce:\r\n1. Install any ES version prior to ES-5.x.x\r\n2. Install Elasticsearch-head in previous ES version (Validate its installation as it will be listed under $ES_HOME/plugins directory)\r\n3. Upgrade ES to ES-5.1.1\r\n4. Add ES as a service\r\n5. Run ES as a service. You will get following STDOUT console on command line:-\r\n\r\nroot@ubuntu:/home/yuvraj# sudo service elasticsearch start\r\n Starting Elasticsearch Server                                                                         [2016-12-11T12:07:50,609][WARN ][o.e.c.l.LogConfigurator  ] ignoring unsupported logging configuration file [/etc/elasticsearch/logging.yml], logging is configured via [/etc/elasticsearch/log4j2.properties]\r\n                                                                                                  [ OK ]\r\n\r\nPlease find required details as mentioned below - \r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version**: Elasticsearch-5.1.1\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: elasticsearch-head\r\n\r\n**JVM version**: Oracle java version \"1.8.0_91\"\r\n\r\n**OS version**: Ubuntu 14.04\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**: [elasticsearch-error-captured.txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/644320/elasticsearch-error-captured.txt)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
