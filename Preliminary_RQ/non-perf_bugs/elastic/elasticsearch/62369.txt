the [index blocks settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-blocks.html#index-block-settings) documentation, the `index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete` setting is documented twice with slightly different descriptions.\r\n\r\nBased on the commit history, the first instance seems to have been initially removed (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/822b7421ce2cbbeb0cf64c0e15f7e0b9b5963b69) and then re-introduced in a later commit (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/20d04081ec79450261d84df11c961fcc2d2d3034).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the indentation for the second instance/description seems inconsistent with the rest of the documentation: it is aligned with top level documentation rather than setting specific description.","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
