I found out that highlighting if one of the heaviest consumers of CPU for my use case.  So I figured anything that I can do to lower it would be useful.  This could allow you to skip highlighting some fields entirely.\n\nImplemented this with a different api.  It looks like:\n\n``` js\n{\n    \"highlight\": {\n        \"fields\": {\n            \"title\": {\n                \"conditional\": {\n                    \"match\": {\n                        \"text\": {\n                            \"no_match_size\": 100,\n                            \"skip_matching\":  true\n                        }\n                    }\n                    \"no_match\": {\n                        \"text\": {\n                            \"no_match_size\": 100\n                        }\n                    },\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEach field can contain a `conditional` field.  There no limit other then your imagination.  And memory.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
