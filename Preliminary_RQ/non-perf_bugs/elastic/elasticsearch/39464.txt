The only plugin I can find that actually does this is [Tempest](https://github.com/datarank/tempest) and this only supports versions prior to 2.3.2 which are long past the end of their supported lives.\r\n\r\nMaintaining this pluggability constrains our choices for improving the shards allocator, and yet there appears to be little appetite to use this flexibility in the wild. I propose deprecating this pluggability in the 7.x series and removing it in 8.0.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to gather feedback on the idea. If you rely on being able to plug in a custom allocator, or otherwise implement the `ClusterPlugin` interface, please let us know here.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
