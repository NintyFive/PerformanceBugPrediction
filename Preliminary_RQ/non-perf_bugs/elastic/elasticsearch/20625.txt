[Per the rest api spec description](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v2.4.0/rest-api-spec/src/main/resources/rest-api-spec/api/reindex_rethrottle.json), `requests_per_second` can be `0` or `\"unlimited\"` to represent no throttle, or any float greater than 0.\n\nHowever, Elasticsearch 2.4.0 does not accept `0` as a value for `requests_per_second`. Response returned is\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 386\n\n{\n  \"error\" : {\n    \"root_cause\" : [ {\n      \"type\" : \"illegal_argument_exception\",\n      \"reason\" : \"[requests_per_second] must be a float greater than 0.

Use \\\"unlimited\\\" to disable throttling.\"\n  },\n  \"status\" : 400\n}\n```\n\nI wasn't sure what the consensus for a change would be here; \n- change the implementation to allow `0`, or align with 5.0 and remove `\"unlimited\"` and accept `-1` for no throttle\n- change documentation to indicate float greater than 0 or `\"unlimited\"`\n","closed_by":{"login":"Sue-Gallagher","id":36747279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzQ3Mjc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/36747279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sue-Gallagher","html_url":"https://github.com/Sue-Gallagher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sue-Gallagher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sue-Gallagher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sue-Gallagher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sue-Gallagher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sue-Gallagher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sue-Gallagher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sue-Gallagher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sue-Gallagher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sue-Gallagher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
