Is it possible that you indexed a document into the same index where the `postDate` field was interpreted as a numeric value by dynamic mapping? This might also have been a document with a different type, because fields with the same name in different document types in the same index map to the same Lucene field name internally (see this [blogpost](https://www.elastic.co/blog/great-mapping-refactoring#conflicting-mappings) for more details). \nHope this solves your problem. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/163930140","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15375#issuecomment-163930140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15375","id":163930140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzkzMDE0MA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-11T12:50:46Z","updated_at":"2015-12-11T12:50:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As @cbuescher says, this may well be caused by having different mappings on different shards (something you can't diagnose with the get mapping API, but which is prevented in 2.0).
