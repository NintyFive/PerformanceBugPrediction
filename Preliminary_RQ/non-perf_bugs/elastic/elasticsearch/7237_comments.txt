I can change that but I am unsure what is the expected behavior here.\n2. `_analyzer` is currently not a field mapper at all and I think the documentation is lying: `\"index\": \"no\"` has no effect, the field will always use default configuration. \n\nIn addition for consistency I think `_analyzer` should behave just like `_boost`, that is: Either the `\"path\"` in `_analyzer` should also be called `\"name\"` like in `_boost` or the other way round. Depending on what the decision is for 1. `_analyzer` should also behave that way.\n\nSo: Do we want the `_boost` to be the name for get field mapping requests or the name defined in `\"name\"`?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/54071220","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7237#issuecomment-54071220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7237","id":54071220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MDcxMjIw","user":{"login":"Mpdreamz","id":245275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTI3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/245275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz","html_url":"https://github.com/Mpdreamz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-01T15:19:41Z","updated_at":"2014-09-01T15:21:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

`_analyzer` is a special field mapper if I'm not mistaken:\nhttp://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-analyzer-field.html\n\nIt allows a document field to supply
