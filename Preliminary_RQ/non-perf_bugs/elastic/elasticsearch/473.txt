Defaults to `ES_HOME\\data`.\n`path.logs`: path to logs location. Defaults to `ES_HOME\\logs`.\n`path.work`: path to temporary data created. Defaults to `ES_HOME\\work`.\n\nIn order to upgrade to new version, the simplest thing to do is rename `work` to `data`. If `path.work` is set to point to the data location storage, change it to `path.data`.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
