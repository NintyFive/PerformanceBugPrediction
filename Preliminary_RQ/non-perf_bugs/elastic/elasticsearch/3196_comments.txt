I added a commit to a branch with a test that reproduces this issue.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/30618883","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3196#issuecomment-30618883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3196","id":30618883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjE4ODgz","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-15T20:05:42Z","updated_at":"2013-12-15T20:05:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Added a fix for this in the commit above.
