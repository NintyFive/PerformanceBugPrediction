Trove and Snappy have been removed a while ago. Sigar, JNA and JTS are imported, and distributed as part of the Elasticsearch package, but (as I understand it) are not linked.

LGPL are for own-released code, not for ES or anybody else. The interpretation of copyleft.org linked by @paulbakker  above is rather clear, and MO is that the general accepted approach is that it is OK for Apache-licensed Java code to depend on unmodified LGPL-licensed third-party Jars without having these Jars have an impact of the Apache licensing. This would considered as a work \"using the library\". The requirements of the LGPL still apply of course to the LGPL-licensed library. \n\n@clintongormley linking as understood when interpreting the LGPL does not really matter in Java as I would understand this to be of dynamic nature.\n\nMy point here is that for ES to comply with these requirements, there are a few essential things to do such as ensuring the proper license texts and credit notices are produced where needed and that the corresponding source code is available for redistribution. And yes, the source code need to provided (either on request or simplest side-by-side or in the download itself) and this is not a requirement that can be delegated elsewhere IMHO.\n\nNote also that beyond LGPL-licensed components, the notices included in ES are rather minimalist and possibly incomplete and I would expect more from an open source project.\n\nAll in all not a lot of work though @clintongormley I think it would be best for a project member to work on that than me ...\n\n## \n\nCordially\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/66872364","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2794#issuecomment-66872364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2794","id":66872364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODcyMzY0","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-13T10:42:07Z","updated_at":"2014-12-13T10:42:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yea, we need to add JTS, JNA to the notice page, mention they use LGPLv2 license with relevant links to the project pages in the notice, we should also mention that they are optional (the system can run without them).
