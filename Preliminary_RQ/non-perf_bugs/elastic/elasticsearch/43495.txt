We also saw lot of frequent GC pauses on the indexing process . Turns out it's all due to disabling tcp compression which was by default `true` in 2.4.6 but `false` in 6.6.1. Doc's doesn't mention the same. Both version docs say compression is disabled by default. But our isssues went away after setting the `transport.tcp.compress` true in our transport client settings in 6.6.1 version.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time figuring out the root cause as it wasn't documented in any breaking changes doc as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/modules-transport.html\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/modules-transport.html\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"andrershov","id":600624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDYyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/600624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov","html_url":"https://github.com/andrershov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
