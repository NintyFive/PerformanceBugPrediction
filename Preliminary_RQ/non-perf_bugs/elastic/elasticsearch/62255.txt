Initially this was introduced to determine the existing behavior and because the actual implementation requires scripting which is not ideal performance wise.\r\n\r\nAs Elasticsearch now supports such queries, this setting should be removed and EQL be always insensitive, where applicable.\r\nThis means:\r\noperators: `==` and `!=`. Currently `>=`, `<=`, `<` and `>` are not supported\r\nfunctions: `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `stringContains`, `between`, `match`, `wildcard` (note some regex might not fully support this, requiring the user to change the regex. This is considering missing functionality and will be added asap once the missing bits land in ES).\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
