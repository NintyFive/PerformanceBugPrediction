is related to: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/35433\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`):\r\n\r\n6.6.1\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nKeystore data inserted with `elasticsearch-keystore add --stdin` is unusable for GCS credentials while data inserted using `elasticsearch-keystore add-file` is perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear if this really is the intended behaviour:\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/settings/KeyStoreWrapper.java#L542\r\n\r\nIf yes, then at least the Puppet code will need adjustments to bind types to credentials because it only supports `add --stdin` at this point:\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/puppet-elasticsearch/blob/master/lib/puppet/provider/elasticsearch_keystore/elasticsearch_keystore.rb\r\n\r\nThis needs to be described there at least:\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/repository-gcs-usage.html\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nLoading data with using:\r\n```\r\ncat /secrets/file | /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-keystore add --force --stdin  gcs.client.XYZ.credentials_file\r\n```\r\n\r\n... produces an error upon `POST _nodes/reload_secure_settings`:\r\n```json\r\n   {\r\n      \"name\" : \"mynode.net\",\r\n      \"reload_exception\" : {\r\n        \"type\" : \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n        \"reason\" : \"Secret setting gcs.client.XYZ.credentials_file is not a file\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile inserting the same data using `add-file` does not output any error\r\n```\r\n/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-keystore add-file --force gcs.client.XYZ.credentials_file /secrets/file\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: The keystores do not have the same file sizes on disk (2559 bytes with `--stdin`, 2557 with `add-file`).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
