We don't use this module but it's referenced through the `suggest` module that we use. It's not needed at runtime for ES so it can safely excluded. I wonder if we should mark it as provided via maven ie. using this:\n\n``` XML\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>org.apache.lucene</groupId>\n  <artifactId>lucene-expressions</artifactId>\n  <version>${lucene.version}</version>\n  <scope>provided</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nI will run tests to see if that helps. Can you check if that would work for you?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/33109259","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4858#issuecomment-33109259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4858","id":33109259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTA5MjU5","user":{"login":"apatrida","id":182340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/182340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida","html_url":"https://github.com/apatrida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-23T09:41:24Z","updated_at":"2014-01-23T09:41:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I excluded the module and I no longer receive the error message.
