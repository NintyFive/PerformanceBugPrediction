that  https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/46257 has improved internal memory usage we no longer need the default limit of 100 filters defined by `index.max_adjacency_matrix_filters`.\r\n\r\nWe decided on the following changes:\r\n\r\nIn 7.x continue to use `index.max_adjacency_matrix_filters` setting but start using `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count` as the new default value for the setting and return deprecation warnings for any user-supplied settings.\r\nIn 8.0 remove `index.max_adjacency_matrix_filters` setting and rely solely on `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count`.","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
