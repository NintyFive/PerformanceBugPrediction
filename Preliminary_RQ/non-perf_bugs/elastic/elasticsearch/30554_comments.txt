Most importantly, direct information on how to reproduce would be helpful. That said, I see code here that I do not recognize:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMay 13 13:55:40 TVTC-clm2 systemd[1]: Ignoring invalid environment assignment 'if [ \"x$1\"== \"xstart\" -o \"x$1\" == \"xrestart\" -o \"x$1\" == \"xreload\" -o \"x$1\" == \"xforce-reload\" ];then': /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch\r\nMay 13 13:55:40 TVTC-clm2 systemd[1]: Ignoring invalid environment assignment 'if [ \"$GET_ES_CONFIG_RETURN\" !=0]; then': /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes me believe this is a custom installation and we are unlikely to consider this a bug and support it. As we only handle verified bugs and feature requests on this repository, I am going to close this issue and suggest that you use the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
