(Prior to 6.2.4 there was another bug that meant we'd reallocate such jobs to other nodes and set them back to `OPENED`.)\r\n\r\nHowever, the logic that limits how many jobs are `OPENING` on a particular node considers all jobs allocated to the node that have stale persistent tasks to be `OPENING`.  This means that if you restart a node that has 2 or more `FAILED` or `CLOSING` jobs then it cannot open any more jobs after being restarted (because we only allow two `OPENING` jobs per node at any time).\r\n\r\nTo prevent this problem, `FAILED` and `CLOSING` jobs should not be considered `OPENING` if their persistent task status is stale.\r\n\r\n/cc @jgowdyelastic","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
