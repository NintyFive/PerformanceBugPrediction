One difference between the previous version and 7.0.0 is that It is bigger than previous tar files. Later I noticed that Java is bundled with distribution so that we don't need to set JAVA_HOME explicitly. But my doubt is that Elastic needs just java runtime right ?. If so, We should include **JRE, not the JDK**. \r\n<img width=\"449\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-29 at 11 51 50 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1736813/56879201-338b5d00-6a75-11e9-92ae-923db20f5a53.png\">\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
