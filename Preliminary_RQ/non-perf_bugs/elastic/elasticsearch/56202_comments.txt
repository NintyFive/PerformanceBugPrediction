Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report.

I believe it's a bug and not lack of knowledge on our side. As I've written all was working fine and stopped suddenly after some time and now even very simple queries with \"scroll\" on idle cluster return 500. Problem is I cannot give you step by step instruction how to reproduce. But before I raised issue here I've asked on forum. Here's my thread -> https://discuss.elastic.co/t/did-i-hit-bug-related-to-scroll-and-too-many-scroll-contexts/230954 Please consider reopen this.
