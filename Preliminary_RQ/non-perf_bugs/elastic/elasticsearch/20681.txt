But in our cluster setup we have 3 nodes (out of 9) which have different hardware (disk, less iops) and those are causing performance problems when they have to handle requests. To solve the issue I disabled sniffing again and didn't connect to those 3 nodes. \n\nIn order to still have node discovery in case a node is added or removed to/from the cluster it would be great to have an exclusion feature.\n\n```\nSettings.Builder settingsBuilder = Settings.settingsBuilder()\n                .put(\"cluster.name\", \"cluster\")\n                .put(\"client.transport.sniff\", true).\n                .putArray(\"client.transport.sniff.exclude\", \"node1\", \"node2\", ...);\n```\n\nSo sniffing would detect every x seconds all the nodes in the cluster, but it will not connect to the ones which are excluded.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
