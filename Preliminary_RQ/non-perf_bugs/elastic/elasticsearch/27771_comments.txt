Sometimes they contain the fields that are used in the demonstrated queries, sometimes not. It would be much clearer if there were a few fixed indices created at the very beginning, and all queries would be run against those.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/351075722","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27771#issuecomment-351075722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27771","id":351075722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTA3NTcyMg==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-12T14:57:55Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T14:58:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> the same indices are created over and over again, sometimes with different mappings, sometimes with the same\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback, I agree this can be confusing. On the other hand, there are so many small variations in the index setup that you need in order to demonstrate a certain feature that I think it would be difficult to create just a few \"tutorial\" indices. In the end this is more of a reference guide and a lot of people don't systematically work through the whole documentation, so repeating a minimal setup for each feature makes sense to me.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/351076785","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27771#issuecomment-351076785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27771","id":351076785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTA3Njc4NQ==","user":{"login":"DavidNemeskey","id":690386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/690386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidNemeskey","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidNemeskey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidNemeskey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidNemeskey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidNemeskey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidNemeskey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidNemeskey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidNemeskey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidNemeskey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidNemeskey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidNemeskey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-12T15:01:27Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T15:01:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Fair enough.
