The joining code always tries to compute a score explanation even in the case that a document doesn't match. With `score_mode` set to `avg` this causes a NPE and with other score modes it returns a score explanation that indicates that the document matched while it didn't.\n\nI opened an issue in Lucene to fix the problem: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-7065\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/192416576","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16525#issuecomment-192416576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16525","id":192416576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjQxNjU3Ng==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-04T19:06:53Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T19:06:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"[LUCENE-7065](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-7065) has been fixed in Lucene 6.0, and so will be fixed in Elasticsearch 5.0.0.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
