Per discussion with @ywelsch , a large number like this will cause the cluster look 400 steps into the future to find the right balance (= optimistic model). If it takes the cluster too long time to actually execute on this plan (shards being failed after 30 minutes because recovery not started yet), it will make subsequent decisions based on an optimistic model that it's not able to realize.  \r\n\r\nIt can be helpful to add a safeguard/hard limit (linking parent ticket: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11511) to prevent users from setting it to too high of a value.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
