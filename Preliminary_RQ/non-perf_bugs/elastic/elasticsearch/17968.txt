This can be confusing to admins.  It is more user friendly if we can return all index templates including ones defined on disk via the API - and add a metadata field to tag index templates created on disk in the api output so users can tell which ones are set in the API vs. on disk (and maybe disallow changes via the template api for the ones that are managed on disk).\n","closed_by":{"login":"ppf2","id":7216393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTYzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7216393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2","html_url":"https://github.com/ppf2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
