The issue you link to refers to nested fields, but the terminology is incorrect.  Really it is talking about ordinary object or multi-fields, not real `nested` fields.\n\nNested fields need to be queries with nested queries/filters, because multiple documents can match and you need to be able to specify how these multiple scores should be reduced to a single score.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/73666624","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9611#issuecomment-73666624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9611","id":73666624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNjY2NjI0","user":{"login":"BlackSlashProd","id":6058530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTg1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6058530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackSlashProd","html_url":"https://github.com/BlackSlashProd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackSlashProd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackSlashProd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackSlashProd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackSlashProd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackSlashProd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackSlashProd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackSlashProd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackSlashProd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackSlashProd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-10T09:11:38Z","updated_at":"2015-02-10T09:11:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok thanks @clintongormley.\n\nI think I understand the cause. \n\nBut I ask me \"Why when you don't specify the queried fields, ES search in nested fields ?\"\n\n`curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/test/tweet/_search' -d '{`\n`\"query\": {`\n`\"simple_query_string\": {`\n`\"query\": \"Hello\"`\n`}`\n`}}'`\n\nSo as I have to do something like that ?\n`curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/test/tweet/_search' -d '{`\n`\"query\" : {`\n`\"bool\" : {`\n`\"should\" : [`\n`{`\n`\"simple_query_string\": {`\n`\"query\": \"Hello\",`\n`\"fields\" : [\"message\"]`\n`}`\n`},`\n`{`\n`\"nested\": {`\n`\"path\": \"comments\",`\n`\"query\": {`\n`\"multi_match\": {`\n`\"query\": \"Hello\",`\n`\"fields\": [\"name\",\"comment\"]`\n`}`\n`}`\n`}`\n`}`\n`]`\n`}`\n`}`\n`}`\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/74049186","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9611#issuecomment-74049186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9611","id":74049186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MDQ5MTg2","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-12T10:30:08Z","updated_at":"2015-02-12T10:30:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When you don't specify a field, you are actually querying the single catch-all `_all` field, not each field separately.
