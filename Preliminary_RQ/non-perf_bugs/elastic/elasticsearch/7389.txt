The logic today is:\n- `recover_after_nodes` (and friends) are hard limits.  The cluster _will not_ recover unless these conditions are met.\n- Once the `recover_after_*` conditions are met, the cluster waits for `gateway.expected_nodes` OR `gateway.recover_after_time`, whichever comes first.\n\nThis is a confusing sequence of logic, since `gateway.recover_after_time` looks like a \"failsafe\" that will start recovery after X period of time, regardless of the other settings.  In reality, it is only invoked if the first `recover_after_*` settings are satisfied.\n\nAt a minimum, the docs should spell this out more clearly.  Better, we should probably do some renaming.  Perhaps:\n- `recover_after_nodes` becomes `minimum_node_count` ?\n- `gateway.recover_after_time` becomes `gateway.wait_for_expected` ?\n\nAnd there should probably be a new setting, `force_recover_after_time` which will force recovery regardless of any other setting, in case people want a nuclear failsafe option to get the cluster back online.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
