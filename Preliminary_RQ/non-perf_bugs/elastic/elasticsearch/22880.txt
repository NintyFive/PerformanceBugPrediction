I have an index with a float field, I called it 'analysis_time'.\r\nI create a query to search between 2 values, using gte and lt. Here is my query:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"range\": {\r\n      \"analysis_time\": {\r\n        \"lt\": <float-value>,\r\n        \"gte\": <float-value>\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nI established a range between 2 float number, for example \r\n        \"lt\": 1485851711.686809,\r\n        \"gte\": 1485850431.424259\r\n\r\nI have 2 documents with 2 float_values in that range: 1485850431.424259 and 1485851710.686809, so when I execute the query both should be returned, but only 1 its return to me (1485850431.42425).\r\n\r\nIf i change the lt for lte, does not work too.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Create a index and store documents with this float values: \r\n```\r\n curl -X PUT <elastic-host><index_name>/1/_create -d'{\"analysis_time\":1485851710.686809}\r\n curl -X PUT <elastic-host><index_name>/2/_create -d'{\"analysis_time\":1485850431.424259}\r\n```\r\n 2. Execute the query:\r\ncurl -X POST <elastic-host><index_name>/_search -d'{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"range\": {\r\n      \"analysis_time\": {\r\n        \"lt\": 1485851711.686809,\r\n        \"gte\": 1485850431.424259\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}'\r\n 3. Check that only 1 hit is returned.\r\n\r\n4. Execute the query:\r\ncurl -X POST <elastic-host><index_name>/_search -d'{\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"range\": {\r\n      \"analysis_time\": {\r\n        \"lte\": 1485851709.686809\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n4. Check that 2 hits are returned and only 1 should be returned (1485850431.424259)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
