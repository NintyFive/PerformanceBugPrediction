My logic was originally to extract the tar into my root folder, regardless of what was there (blowing away an existing installation if necessary).  Then if the untar succeeds, I try to restart the Elasticsearch service.\n\nThis was when I noticed that untarring was causing the existing Java Elasticsearch process to consistently experience an uncaught segfault.  This is with Sun Java 7u25 and ES 1.0.1.\n\nI changed my logic to first shutdown any running service before untarring, so I got around the segfault.  But this doesn't seem like normal behavior.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
