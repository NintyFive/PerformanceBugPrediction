The idea here is to allow to more easily build a concise match type query over multiple fields instead of using a relative more expressive query by using multiple match queries within a `bool` query.\n\nThe structure of the query is a bit different. Instead of a nested json object defining the query field, there is a top json level field for defining the query fields. Example:\n\n```\n{\n  \"multi_match\" : {\n    \"query\" : \"this is a test\",\n    \"fields\" : [ \"subject\", \"message\" ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `multi_match` query creates ether a `bool` or a `dis_max`top level query. Each field is a query clause in this top level query. The query clause contains the actual query (the specified 'type' defines what query this will be). Each query clause is basically a `should` clause.\n## Options\n\nAll options that apply on the `match` query also apply on the `multi_match` query. The 'match' query options apply only on the individual clauses inside the top level query.\n- `fields` - Fields to be used in the query.\n- `use_dis_max` - Boolean indicating to either create a `dis_max` query or a `bool` query. Defaults to `true`.\n- `tie_breaker` - Multiplier value to balance the scores between lower and higher scoring fields. Only applicable when `use_dis_max` is set to true. Defaults to `0.0`.\n\nThe query accepts all the options that a regular `match` query accepts.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
