That still would leave us needing to better handle these situations for the 5.x series as the current behaviour is trappy. We discussed with Colin and Christoph that we could convert the empty brackets to something else at parse time already, so that we wouldn't have to serialize this weird query and keep track of the fact that there were empty brackets all the way to the shards where the query is converted to a lucene query.
