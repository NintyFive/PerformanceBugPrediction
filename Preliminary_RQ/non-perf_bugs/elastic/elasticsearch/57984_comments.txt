reason of why length filter shouldnt work for normalizer\r\n\r\nNormalizers for keywords typically should only modify the input slightly, like e.g. lowercasing, character conversions etc. The `length` filter removes tokens from a stream instead, which makes sense on a `text` field where you might want to not index short tokens. I'm not sure this is what you are looking for here, especially with a `max : 8191` setting. As @gaobinlong already mentioned there is `ignore_above` for this.

Would you mind sharing that exception and how you run into it?\r\nThe other suggestion I'd have is to try an ingest processor (e.g. a script processor) that creates a truncated field conditioned on the input length. This is a quick sketch that certailny needs extension (edge cases, null handling etc...) but could give you an alternative:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT _ingest/pipeline/truncate\r\n{\r\n  \"description\": \"truncate first 128 characters\",\r\n  \"processors\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"script\": {\r\n        \"lang\": \"painless\",\r\n        \"source\": \"ctx.truncated = ctx.status.substring(0, (int) Math.min(128,ctx.status.length()));\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nPOST /test/_doc/1?pipeline=truncate\r\n{\r\n  \"status\" : <...your long input here...>\r\n}\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/645325669","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57984#issuecomment-645325669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57984","id":645325669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTMyNTY2OQ==","user":{"login":"SLavrynenko","id":16493827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDkzODI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16493827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLavrynenko","html_url":"https://github.com/SLavrynenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLavrynenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLavrynenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLavrynenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLavrynenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLavrynenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLavrynenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLavrynenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLavrynenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLavrynenko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-17T11:47:53Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T11:47:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yeah, its exactly this 32k limit (8191 if its a Unicode string)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/665207815","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57984#issuecomment-665207815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57984","id":665207815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NTIwNzgxNQ==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-28T18:35:55Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T18:35:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@SLavrynenko sorry for the long radio silence, I just summarized parts of our discussion here in #60329 to get input on the options we might consider in this.
