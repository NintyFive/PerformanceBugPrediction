In the case of long inputs I prefer to split it in a number of inputs: short, medium and full. Now they have got the same weigth, so they `autocomplete` phrase together, while they should appear one after another.\n\n`How to prepare chocolate at home without milk` will be presented as three tokens:\n`How to prepare chocolate`\n`How to prepare chocolate at home`\n`How to prepare chocolate at home without milk`\n\nWhen someone prints `How to` he should see all small tokens like \n`How to make pasta`\n`How to swim`\n`How to prepare chocolate`\n\nso now he choose last and see next suggestions:\n`How to prepare chocolate at home`\n`How to prepare chocolate for youngest brother`\n`How to
