The article you linked to says that `LICENSE.txt` is valid, as does the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#determining-the-location-of-your-license), and the filename is also used by other Open Source projects such as [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/license.txt) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\n> if we scan elastic search jar with any oss review software it fail to detect the license.\r\n\r\nSince you haven't named the software that you're using, it's hard to give an exact answer, but my guess is that you are incorrectly interpreting the results of the scan.\r\nThus repository uses 2 main licenses - some of the repository is under the Open Source \"Apache 2.0 license\", and some is under our custom \"Elastic license\". Therefore our license file is not a standard OSS license - it's actually just an explanation of which license applies to which code.\r\nSoftware scanners cannot detect the license type because we don't have a single, standard licence. Renaming the license file wouldn't help - it still won't be a standard license that the scanner can detect and analyse.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/669996654","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60711#issuecomment-669996654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60711","id":669996654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTk5NjY1NA==","user":{"login":"AjitTK","id":7151036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTEwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7151036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjitTK","html_url":"https://github.com/AjitTK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjitTK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjitTK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjitTK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjitTK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjitTK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjitTK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjitTK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjitTK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AjitTK/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-06T15:23:38Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T15:23:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ok @tvernum ,What I assume is artifact of this repo should contain OSS license , as of now artifact contains LICENSE.txt file .

However, there is no standard. That is simply based on the expectations of github in order to properly show a project's license automatically. In Elasticsearch's case, a link for \"View License\" can be seen on the main project page, since we have a complex license that depends on the file/directory within the source. For something like Apache Lucene, it also shows a message \"Apache-2.0 License\".\r\n\r\nHowever, it sounds like you are not talking about the source code, but instead the jars we produce. We embed the license, whether the apache 2.0 license for oss code, or the Elastic license for commercial code, in each relevant jar. This license file, as you have noted, is named LICENSE.txt. The name of the file does not determine if a license is oss, but instead the contents do. If you are using a tool to inspect jars to find their license, I suggest you go back to that tool's author and ensure both that common license file names can be found (since both the mentioned filenames are common), and that custom licenses can be configured, such as Elastic's license.\r\n\r\nGiven that our project uses very common naming for this file, I am going to close this issue, as we do not plan to change it.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
