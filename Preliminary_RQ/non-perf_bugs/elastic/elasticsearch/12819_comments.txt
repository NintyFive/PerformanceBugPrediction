Don't try to put every analysis variation into a single field - you just end up with garbage.  Instead break it down into a few fields used for different purposes, eg one with standard analyzer, one with stopwords and stemmer, etc\n\nI'd be interested in seeing a full JSON replication (without word delimiter), ie something that I can run easily without having to build my own example
