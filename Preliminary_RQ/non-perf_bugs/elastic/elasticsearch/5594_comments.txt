By default, it is done in a scheduled manner, since the assumption is that if HA is needed, another node with a replica will be allocated. Since in the replica case, we do sync replication, the default doesn't have to be fsync on each write.\n\nIn your case, you have several options:  \n1. add another node and a replica, indexing speed will still be slower (because of sync replication), but you will have another copy of the data \n2. If you only care about bulk level \"syncs\", flush after each bulk request.\n3. Enable fsync after each write as explained, with the fact that indexing will be slower.\n\nOn all cases, you can improve the speed by having faster disk /
