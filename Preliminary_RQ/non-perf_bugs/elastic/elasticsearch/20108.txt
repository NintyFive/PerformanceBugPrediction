It will be useful to include caching details as part of the profile api output to indicate which clauses are being cached vs. not cached.  This will be helpful additional diagnostic information to have, for some of queries with not cached clauses may not end up showing up in the hot threads (and there is not a way to examine the cached entries or the entires that were part of the history of entries).\n","closed_by":{"login":"ppf2","id":7216393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTYzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7216393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2","html_url":"https://github.com/ppf2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppf2/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
