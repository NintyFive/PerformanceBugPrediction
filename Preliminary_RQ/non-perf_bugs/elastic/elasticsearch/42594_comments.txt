We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. There is an Elasticsearch and a Logstash section, since you are unsure where this problem belongs. One thing to note: [types are in the process of being removed](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/removal-of-types.html) but it looks like your logstash output is still using \"_doc\" as a type, so [I think you need it to request the mapping still](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/indices-get-mapping.html). You can try this an ask any further advice in the forums please. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/498150962","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42594#issuecomment-498150962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42594","id":498150962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODE1MDk2Mg==","user":{"login":"nguedon","id":18598950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTk4OTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18598950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguedon","html_url":"https://github.com/nguedon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguedon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguedon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguedon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguedon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguedon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguedon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguedon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguedon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguedon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-03T07:51:21Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T07:51:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok thanks for your answer i will go on support forum so ;)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
