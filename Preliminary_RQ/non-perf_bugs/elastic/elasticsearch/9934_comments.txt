Dates being returned in scientific notation with the wrong value.  I get stuff like: \n\n```\n\"aggregations\": {\n    \"time-test\": {\n        \"avg\": 7.078292805144e-312,\n        \"avg_as_string\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"count\": 1847,\n        \"max\": 7.078307915815e-312,\n        \"max_as_string\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"min\": 7.07828016824e-312,\n        \"min_as_string\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n        \"sum\": 1.307360681110475e-308,\n        \"sum_as_string\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe field in question contains dates from the modern day (2015), not 1970.\n\n```\n\"version\" : {\n  \"number\" : \"1.5.0\",\n  \"build_hash\" : \"544816042d40151d3ce4ba4f95399d7860dc2e92\",\n  \"build_timestamp\" : \"2015-03-23T14:30:58Z\",\n  \"build_snapshot\" : false,\n  \"lucene_version\" : \"4.10.4\"\n}\n```\n\nSoon after, the problem disappeared without having changed any code.  It just seems to happen based on some sensitivity to the data in the index.  I can't reproduce the problem now.  I didn't delete any data from the index, just kept adding more.
