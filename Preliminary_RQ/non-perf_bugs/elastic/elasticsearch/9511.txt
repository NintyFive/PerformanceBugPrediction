had some trouble importing some geo_shapes in 1.4+, I get the exception:\n`ElasticsearchParseException: Invaild shape: Hole is not within polygon`\n\nI got an example. Now, I'm not an expert in GIS, but:\n- The area looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/oDzSeDQ.png with one vertex of the hole in the same point as one vertex of the polygon.\n- The data is from postgis' ST_AsGeoJSON and according to ST_isValid it's a valid area.\n- **Every version of ES from 0.90 to 1.3.x takes the area just fine**. The problems happens after 1.4.0.\n\nHere's the gist with all the data to reproduce it:\nhttps://gist.github.com/bictorman/064a777499719ad66194\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
