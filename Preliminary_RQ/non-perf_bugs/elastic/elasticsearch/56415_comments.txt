Gradle however fails when validating the POM, so we can workaround this temporarily by telling Gradle this repository contains only artifacts, effectively making it ignore the POM. This is actually fine since these are fatjars, so the POM actually contains no useful metadata. When defining your repository in your build script, do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrepositories {\r\n  maven {\r\n    url = 'https://artifacts.elastic.co/maven'\r\n    metadataSources {\r\n      artifact()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/626063473","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56415#issuecomment-626063473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56415","id":626063473,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjA2MzQ3Mw==","user":{"login":"mark-vieira","id":4106672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4106672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-vieira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T23:34:34Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T23:34:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, this has been fixed now for all branches back to `7.6`.\r\n\r\n@mgreau is there way to republish broken artifacts on `https://artifacts.elastic.co/maven`?
