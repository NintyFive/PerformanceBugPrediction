What probably surprises you is that you can't see this string decoded in `_source` document. Actually, we never modify source document. That would explain what you are seeing.\n\nYou could store the document content and then ask for it when searching using `fields` option and you will be able to see the result.\n\nWould be happy to follow up this discussion on the mailing list in case you need to discuss this.\n\nClosing.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
