For an example, it cannot use terms lookup, percolate, geoshape etc, which are pretty evident in the [code](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.10/x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/core/security/authz/support/DLSRoleQueryValidator.java#L142). Another less obvious limitation is that datemath with \"now\" cannot be used in a range query. None of these limitations is documented.
