IMO I don’t think we should have different (meaningful) behaviours for `null` vs an empty list since you can’t really distinguish these cases at the API level, although I would be happy if we simply rejected `null` with an NPE here. The reference manual has [fairly comprehensive documentation of the behaviour](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster.html#cluster-nodes), including this sentence:\r\n\r\n> if no filters are given, the default is to select all nodes\r\n\r\nThe in-code docs for this method are admittedly much less comprehensive.\r\n\r\nThis method can return an empty set of nodes in a number of ways. You could for instance pass a filter that doesn't match any nodes (e.g. `not-a-node-name`, or `_all,master:false` in a one-node cluster) or pass an inconsistent sequence of filters (e.g. `data:true,data:false`), or even a single negative filter (e.g. `ingest:false`).\r\n\r\nSo I think the current behaviour is desired and documented, and callers are correct to expect it to return an empty set of nodes sometimes. I see room for improvement in the Javadoc for this method and IMO rejecting `null` would be a good move.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/595311889","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52887#issuecomment-595311889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52887","id":595311889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTMxMTg4OQ==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-05T16:12:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T16:12:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We discussed this in the team meeting yesterday and decided that I'll open a PR to improve the docs on this method in due course.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/596564601","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52887#issuecomment-596564601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52887","id":596564601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjU2NDYwMQ==","user":{"login":"hendrikmuhs","id":7126422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7126422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrikmuhs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T14:26:26Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T14:26:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DaveCTurner Thanks for clarification.
