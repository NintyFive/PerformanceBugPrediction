For example `SELECT timestamp FROM test WHERE timestamp = '1990-12-12 10:23:00'` will fail in a default index configuration in Elasticsearch because ES will expect the date format to be `1990-12-12T10:23:00`.\r\n\r\nWith a function like `to_char`, the query above becomes `SELECT timestamp FROM test WHERE to_char(timestamp, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') = '1990-12-12 10:23:00'`.\r\n\r\nUsing custom date formats could also work the other way around with functions like `to_date(text, format)` or `to_timestamp`.\r\n\r\nRelates to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50193.","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
