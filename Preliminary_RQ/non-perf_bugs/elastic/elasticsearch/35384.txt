Yet, the same examples should really be used, as the `join` datatype is supposed to be used in combination with the `has_child`/`has_parent` queries.\r\n\r\nE.g., the [`join` datatype](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/parent-join.html) uses an example with \"questions and answers\". [`has_child`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.4/query-dsl-has-child-query.html) and [`has_parent`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/query-dsl-has-parent-query.html) use a \"blogs\" example instead.\r\n\r\nFurther, the documentation for the two queries does not explain fields `parent_type` (for `has_parent` query) and `type` (for `has_child` query). As such, it is unclear how these fields are supposed to be used.
