The Jepsen tests helped verify that we fixed the split brain issue (it no longer happens). In all of our runs though, we couldn't simulate a result similar to your first run (the `isolate-self-primaries-nemesis` where you lost 244/361), still trying, but I might circle back with you to figure out how you ended up with those results. We do manage to simulate the smaller scale data loss that we believe relates to #7572, but this is also still under investigation.\n\nI'll let you know how our continued testing with Jepsen goes, thanks again for your results!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/54481656","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7549#issuecomment-54481656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7549","id":54481656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDgxNjU2","user":{"login":"pilvitaneli","id":6727055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjcwNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6727055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilvitaneli","html_url":"https://github.com/pilvitaneli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilvitaneli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilvitaneli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilvitaneli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilvitaneli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilvitaneli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilvitaneli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilvitaneli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilvitaneli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilvitaneli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-04T14:05:40Z","updated_at":"2014-09-04T14:05:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Running just isolate-self-primaries-nemesis 50 times in a succession results in 22 failures:\n1/403\n404/653\n1/583\n6/667\n287/395\n4/583\n16/655\n3/1037\n8/807\n1/565\n1/555\n5/638\n1/626\n3/784\n3/653\n2/621\n3/632\n1/254\n1/610\n3/307\n11/668\n1/446\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/59934221","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7549#issuecomment-59934221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7549","id":59934221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTM0MjIx","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-21T14:17:47Z","updated_at":"2014-10-21T14:17:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@pilvitaneli circling back to this after a while, do you happen to have the commit sha of Jepsen that you are using for running your tests?
