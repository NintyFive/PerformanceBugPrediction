There is BWC compatible flag that we will enable by default in 7.x, but is currently not enabled as default in master of today. \r\n\r\nCan you retry your watch with `\"rest_total_hits_as_int\": true` ?  You shouldn't need to make that change in your watch for 7.x (that is BWC flag we will set by default)...just confirming that when we do enable that change in master your issue will be fixed. \r\n```\r\n  \"input\": {\r\n    \"search\": {\r\n      \"request\": {\r\n        \"rest_total_hits_as_int\": true,\r\n        \"search_type\": \"query_then_fetch\",\r\n        \"indices\": [\r\n          \"heartbeat-*\"\r\n        ],\r\n```\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
