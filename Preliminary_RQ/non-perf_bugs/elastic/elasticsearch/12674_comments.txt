Like \"only documents with namespace == 0 need to copy their text field to the suggest field\". We never ended up using it and since its been written people have used it for lots of somewhat unexpected things. Its lots of power.\n\nSo I think we have two options:\n1. Remove it\n2. Move it to a plugin\n3. Leave it there and put more big signs on it about how it shouldn't be done\n\nWe should also talk about implementing conditional `copy_to` again. Its less powerful but its maybe less error prone.\n\nOne thing I should mention is that there is a parameter, `_source_transform` that you should be able to stick on get and search requests that will re-run the transform on load. Its meant for debugging but it works.\n\nI'm partial to moving source transform to a plugin and no implementing conditional copy_to.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/128067537","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12674#issuecomment-128067537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12674","id":128067537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODA2NzUzNw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-05T16:47:29Z","updated_at":"2015-08-05T16:47:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'm partial to moving source transform to a plugin and not implementing conditional copy_to.\n\nsounds good to me\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/128067692","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12674#issuecomment-128067692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12674","id":128067692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODA2NzY5Mg==","user":{"login":"pickypg","id":1501235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1501235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg","html_url":"https://github.com/pickypg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-05T16:48:13Z","updated_at":"2015-08-05T16:48:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I'm partial to moving source transform to a plugin and no implementing conditional copy_to.\n\nSounds great to me too.
