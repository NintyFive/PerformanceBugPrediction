We've been chatting internally about this a bit.  I'll start with the easy one:\n\n> Also, could you please consider add a 'Moving Standard deviation' in the future? \n\nDefinitely!  We've talked about this a few times and I know I'd personally like one.  We're currently trying to determine the best way to add it (dedicated agg, or rename `moving_average` to `moving_function` and implement std dev as a \"function, etc).  I think it'll end up as a dedicated `moving_stddev` agg since that's the simplest.\n\n> I expect the moving average equals the average of the current day and previous 2 days, but the results are the average of previous 3 days, and not including the current day.\n\nSo we've been chatting about why we did this, and I think the behavior is \"correct\" because we are using a \"left\" moving average commonly used in financial and other non-signal use-cases (e.g. the value of today is the result of previous values).  For example, financial moving averages use closing prices, and today's value is intrinsically incalculable because today hasn't \"closed\" yet.  Which means that you can only calculate moving averages on previous data points, not today's. This mirrors wiki's definition for a financial SMA:\n\n> In financial applications a simple moving average (SMA) is the unweighted mean of the previous n data\n> For a number of applications, it is advantageous to avoid the shifting induced by using only 'past' data. Hence a central moving average can be computed, using data equally spaced on either side of the point in the series where the mean is calculated\n\nAlso, if today's values were included, the value of today's movavg would change each time you execute the aggregation since the bucket continues \"filling\".\n\nThis is quite a bit different from more science/engineering/signal processing use-cases where you take \"centered\" moving averages (the movavg of a point is the average of `n/2` on each side) in which case it makes sense to include the bucket in it's own movavg.  But since we only support one orientation at the moment, I think the current behavior is \"correct\".\n\nLots of \"scare quotes\" above, because I agree it's more a matter of perspective and how you want to use the moving average.  We still haven't come to a final decision, but I think so far we've at least agreed the current implementation isn't _wrong_ per se. :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/254523981","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20667#issuecomment-254523981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20667","id":254523981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDUyMzk4MQ==","user":{"login":"l8liu","id":7715960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7715960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/l8liu","html_url":"https://github.com/l8liu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l8liu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l8liu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l8liu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l8liu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l8liu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l8liu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l8liu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l8liu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l8liu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T14:25:47Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T14:25:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@polyfractal Thank you very much for your detail explanation and I agree with your consideration of the current moving average implementation.

A lagged moving average can be quite useful, such as when dealing with seasonalities.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, there's an ugly workaround using one or two Moving Average Aggregations and a Bucket Script Aggregation. For what @l8liu was trying to do, use a Bucket Script Aggregation to add the current bucket's value to the moving average result. And to calculate a moving average with a window of 5 and a lag of 3, use:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"aggs\": {\r\n    ...\r\n      },\r\n      \"aggs\": {\r\n        \"my_metric\" :{\r\n          ...\r\n        },\r\n        \"ma_window_plus_shift\": {\r\n          \"moving_avg\": {\r\n            \"buckets_path\": \"my_metric\",\r\n            \"window\": 8\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"ma_shift\": {\r\n          \"moving_avg\": {\r\n            \"buckets_path\": \"my_metric\",\r\n            \"window\": 3\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"lagged_ma\" : {\r\n          \"bucket_script\": {\r\n            \"buckets_path\": {\r\n              \"var1\" : \"ma_window_plus_shift\",\r\n              \"var2\" : \"ma_shift\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"script\": \"(params.var1 - params.var2*3/8)*8/5\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would rather have a shift parameter than use three pipeline aggregations to get one result.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think it's worth adding a note in the documentation indicating the moving average assumes a lag of 1 bucket.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/373756666","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20667#issuecomment-373756666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20667","id":373756666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mzc1NjY2Ng==","user":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-16T15:50:28Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T15:50:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Revisiting - looks like added docs needed and/or a new `shift` param.\r\n\r\ncc @elastic/es-search-aggs","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/393886811","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20667#issuecomment-393886811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20667","id":393886811,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzg4NjgxMQ==","user":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T13:51:04Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T13:51:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@l8liu Heya!
