My customer wants me to produce a news feed of articles for each category and include in that feed the uncategorized articles that are similar to the already categorized set, which are growing and changing as my customer tags unmarked articles.\r\n\r\nUsing the MLT query to do this work pretty well, but I'm having to make two requests in order to produce the news feed. First, I'm having to search for all the articles marked with a given category, and then I have to run a search and pass that set of documents in to the MLT query.\r\n\r\nMaking two requests and passing hundreds or thousands of document ids is pretty inefficient, and truthfully, I expected MLT to support what I need it to do, it seems to be natural extension of the existing behavior.","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
