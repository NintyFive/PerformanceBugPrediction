When you uses this it rejects \"may\" and accepts \"mai\". I tried it your example with random garbage `\"locale\"` settings ant they seem to default to `Root` rather than throw an error. Maybe we should detect that and throw an exception, but unless I'm missing something the locale code here is simply wrong.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/312626393","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25515#issuecomment-312626393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25515","id":312626393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjYyNjM5Mw==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-03T11:55:00Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T11:55:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great! `fr` is exactly what is needed here.\r\nI believe it needs more documentation or as you said a way to reject unknown locale.
