By default it listens on `localhost` port 9200, so http://localhost:9200/_nodes/stats/fs is the default URL for these stats, but there's lots of things you can't do in a browser so I recommend setting up a client like Kibana.\r\n\r\nI'm relabelling this as a stats issue, although as I say I can't see anything that would cause us to see disk stats for the root directory.
