This is expected when an index is set to use a policy that does not exist as well, but it may help to identify the issue.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**: If the policies that don't exist are removed from all indices referencing them using the [Remove Policy API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/ilm-remove-policy.html), then the ILM status will rapidly transition to `STOPPED` as expected.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gwbrown","id":1522844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjI4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1522844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/gwbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
