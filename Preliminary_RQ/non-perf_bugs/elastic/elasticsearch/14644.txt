This should be configured in the `meta` section of the `mutate` processor. The following meta data properties should be able to be modified in the `meta` section:  `_index`, `_type`, `_id`, `_routing`, `_parent`, `_timestamp` and `_ttl`.\n\nMustache templates should be used in order to refer to actual field values in the documents being processed.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"meta\" : {\n      \"_index\" : \"mycompany-{{department}}\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThe index being index to would depend on the `department` field in a document being processed.\n\nPipeline example:\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"description\" : \"...\",\n   \"processors\" : [\n      {\n         \"grok\" : {\n            \"field\" : \"message\",\n            \"pattern\": \"%{IPORHOST:destination} %{DATESTAMP:timestamp} %{DATA:message}\"\n         }\n      },\n      {\n         \"mutate\" : {\n            \"meta\": {\n               \"_index\": \"logs-{{destination}}\",\n               \"_timestamp\": \"{{timestamp}}\"\n            },\n            ...\n         }\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example the destination and the timestamp properties extracted by the `grok` processor are used by the `mutate` processor to determine to what index to send the log to and to attach the timestamp to the `_timestamp` meta field.\n\nFor now the plan is to add template support only to the `meta` options of the `mutate` processor, but the idea is that later almost any processor and pipeline option should be temptable.\n\nOpen question remains if all processors should be able to modify the metadata of a document. \n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
