What is missing is a single per-batch hook that can be used to execute logic after a cluster state update batch is processed.\n\nOne place where this is a concern is in [`o.e.c.a.s.ShardStateAction`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/44467df35301cb4f43e34a326c2f1fa101b50343/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/action/shard/ShardStateAction.java#L151-L157) where, after a batch of shard failures are processed, there is the possibility that a reroute will be required. Without the post-batch hook, this logic is placed in the post-task hook causing reroutes when needed to be executed many times.\n\n``` java\n@Override\npublic void clusterStateProcessed(String source, ClusterState oldState, ClusterState newState) {\n    if (oldState != newState && newState.getRoutingNodes().unassigned().size() > 0) {\n        logger.trace(\"unassigned shards after shard failures. scheduling a reroute.\");\n        routingService.reroute(\"unassigned shards after shard failures, scheduling a reroute\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith a post-batch hook, this logic could be executed exactly once after successful publication of the new cluster state.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
