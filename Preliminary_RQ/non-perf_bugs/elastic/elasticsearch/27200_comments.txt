I notice in your reproduction step you look at `.indices.pest.primaries.get.total` which will only give you the number of requests to a primary shard and will not count requests to replicas. If you have multiple nodes in your cluster then witht he default settings you will have 1 primary and 1 replica for each shard of the `pest` index so it could well be that we hit the primary only 3 times because the request was sent to the replica the other 7 times. Could you see what the value of `.indices.pest.total.get.total` is?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/341200538","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27200#issuecomment-341200538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27200","id":341200538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTIwMDUzOA==","user":{"login":"buildlackey","id":1577925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1577925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buildlackey","html_url":"https://github.com/buildlackey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buildlackey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buildlackey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buildlackey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buildlackey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buildlackey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buildlackey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buildlackey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buildlackey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buildlackey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-01T18:41:30Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T18:41:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What you said makes a lot of sense. I combined your suggestion with an observation from my colleague @gndcshv   where he pointed out that since i was asking for the same ID there might be some caching before the request hit elastic search.  better to use different ID's.   So, I combined those 2 suggestions  and now i get expected behavior..  So..
