Does highlighting with postings depends on search query at all?\n\nhere is a recreation with few mappings similar to my real ones https://gist.github.com/roytmana/7336502\nbut it works\n\nany suggestions towards recreation of the issue would be very helpful\n\nAlex\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/27876308","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4103#issuecomment-27876308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4103","id":27876308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODc2MzA4","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-06T14:17:34Z","updated_at":"2013-11-06T14:17:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@roytmana

@roytmana, thanks a lot for your feedback! \n\nWhat you called \"scrambled highlighting\" has been solved :)\n\nI wonder if you are seeing a regression or a problem that's always been there. Sounds weird that you say the difference is dramatic but you can't reproduce it. It might depend either on your queries or your analysis chain, would be great if you can open another issue with some examples of what doesn't work.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/27878185","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4103#issuecomment-27878185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4103","id":27878185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODc4MTg1","user":{"login":"roytmana","id":2524911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjQ5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2524911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana","html_url":"https://github.com/roytmana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-06T14:40:27Z","updated_at":"2013-11-06T14:41:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"well it worked (except for the wildcards) in the very first drop I tested\n(remember when I posted some performance stats) and then it had scrambled\nhighlighting with some results not highlighted at all and now it\npractically highlight nothing\n\nI will open a new issue based on my last comment\nI will attach the sample recreation with analysis chain I use and a sample\nquery but it does not show the issue\nI can post my real mapping and few real queries if it is of any help\nhopefully it may give you some ideas and you could suggest steps for\ntroubleshooting/recreating\nis there anything else I can provide?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
