Do you still think we should not 404 if there are no matching aliases?\r\n\r\nIt is hard to know the right thing to do here.  I think the problem comes down to the API itself.  The `{index}` portion is really `{index-or-alias}` as either can be provided.  The `{alias}` part means \"filter the result to only show this alias\".  I'm not even sure that this filtering functionality is practically useful.  When would you ask for filtered aliases rather than all the aliases for an index?\r\n\r\nOn top of that, aligning the GET and HEAD behaviours doesn't make much sense here either as they're asking for different things. The HEAD request in our API is defined as \"does this alias exist on this index?\".  \r\n\r\nThe only way I can think to make these two consistent is to throw a 404 if any of the listed aliases doesn't exist.  Maybe that's OK.  It's not terribly useful for GET, but it is useful for HEAD.  Of course, this would be a breaking change\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/305821071","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24644#issuecomment-305821071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24644","id":305821071,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTgyMTA3MQ==","user":{"login":"m1kola","id":509198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTE5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/509198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1kola","html_url":"https://github.com/m1kola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1kola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1kola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1kola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1kola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1kola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1kola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1kola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1kola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1kola/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-02T15:28:00Z","updated_at":"2017-06-02T15:28:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think this should be mentioned in the [Breaking changes in 5.4](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/breaking-changes-5.4.html#breaking-changes-5.4) document and/or fixed, because `HEAD` request returns `404` for this endpoint in Elasticsearch 5.3 (I guess it works in the same way in all 5.* versions except 5.4 and higher).
