What is happening here is that `ips` is already defined in `type` but not in `anytype`. For that cases, we have some logic that tries to borrow the mapping definitions from existing types, but it only works for types that are supported in templates currently (numbers, date and string), so it fails with ip addresses.\n\nI will open a PR soon, but you can work around the problem by defining your ip field in the `_default_` mapping so that it will be used by all types.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/225521039","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18740#issuecomment-225521039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18740","id":225521039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTUyMTAzOQ==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-13T08:41:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T08:41:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually this was fixed by #17882 so I just backported it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/225522125","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18740#issuecomment-225522125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18740","id":225522125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTUyMjEyNQ==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-13T08:46:39Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T08:46:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This will be addressed in the upcoming 2.4.0 release.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/225610548","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18740#issuecomment-225610548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18740","id":225610548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTYxMDU0OA==","user":{"login":"esamudio","id":6547184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDcxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6547184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/esamudio","html_url":"https://github.com/esamudio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esamudio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esamudio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esamudio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esamudio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esamudio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esamudio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esamudio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esamudio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esamudio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-13T15:10:07Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T15:10:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jpountz  Thanks for the update!
