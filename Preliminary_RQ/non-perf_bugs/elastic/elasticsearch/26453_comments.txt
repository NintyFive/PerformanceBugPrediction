the behavior is currently described in the documentation as  \r\n\r\n> Starting with version 1.5.0 incompatible settings are ignored.\r\n\r\nAnd this was how it worked until 5.0.0 when #15278 changed it to fail the restore if at least one setting cannot be applied to the current cluster state instead of ignoring it. @s1monw, do you remember if this was a conscious decision and we just forgot to update the docs or it is a bug and we need to revert it to just ignore the settings we don't
