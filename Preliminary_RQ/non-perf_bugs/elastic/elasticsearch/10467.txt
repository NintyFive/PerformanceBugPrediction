I want all such id fields to be \"not_analyzed.\" The id fields always have an '_id' suffix and these fields can appear at arbitrary levels in the document hierarchy. I'm trying to come up with a dynamic mapping template to address this so that any field of the form \"__id\" regardless of the nesting depth will be marked as \"not_analyzed.\" I don't think there's a way to specify this as a single path_match.  In practice, I suppose the nesting will never go deeper than let's say, 5.  So I could define 5 path_match patterns like *_id, *.__id, _._.*_id...etc. Although experience shows that the moment I do this, we'll find the need to go to 6 levels ;-). \n\nIdeally, you'd be able to specify a path in ANT-like syntax e.g., *_/__id.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
