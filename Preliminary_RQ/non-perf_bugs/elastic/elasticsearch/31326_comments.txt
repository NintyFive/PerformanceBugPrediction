We test docs snippets nowadays so if some code doesn't compile we should have caught it.\r\n\r\nOn deprecating, we consider this an internal API, are you using it from a plugin? See #28972 for the PR where this was changed, the replacement is `Strings.toString(XContentBuilder)`. We don't generally go through deprecation for this type of changes, as the java compiler helps users finding out where they have to adapt their code. cc @dakrone","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/397260432","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31326#issuecomment-397260432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31326","id":397260432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzI2MDQzMg==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-14T11:20:42Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T11:20:42Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/397263872","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31326#issuecomment-397263872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31326","id":397263872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzI2Mzg3Mg==","user":{"login":"brackxm","id":1204681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDQ2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1204681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brackxm","html_url":"https://github.com/brackxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brackxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brackxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brackxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brackxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brackxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brackxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brackxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brackxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brackxm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-14T11:36:08Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T11:36:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for providing the replacement.\r\nThe compiler does help in finding the problem, not in providing a solution.\r\nA deprecation with comment with the replacement would have helped.\r\n\r\nI would not consider an method mentioned in the documentation internal.\r\nIt is mentioned here\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/current/java-docs-index.html","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/397336783","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31326#issuecomment-397336783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31326","id":397336783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzMzNjc4Mw==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-14T15:28:17Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T15:28:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@brackxm thanks for the link, I didn't realize we used this method in the documentation.
