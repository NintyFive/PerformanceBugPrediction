There are two possibilties to solve this.\n- Do not use the standard analyzer (which might make sense, as you do not want to remove stopwords in name fields most of the time) for the field\n- Use the `analyzer` parameter of the query in order to change it, see http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/match-query/\n\nNote that the first solutions applies at index time, where the second solution applies at query time.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
