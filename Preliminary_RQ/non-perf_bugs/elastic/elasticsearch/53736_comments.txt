Going to close this as a duplicate of: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50109\r\n\r\n@ajacob agreed!  That's pretty much the direction we are thinking as well.  In the most recent comment of that thread (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50109#issuecomment-578264809) we suggested an extra flag on `extended_bounds` which lets you indicate that unbounded ranges should be \"truncated\" at the provided limits.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this would also fix a normal complaint with `extended_bounds` that it creates more buckets than expected, even for normal field types.  E.g. people expect it to work as a hard threshold, when in reality it's a `max(extended_bounds, data bounds)` situation.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
