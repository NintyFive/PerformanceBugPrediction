And also that there maybe other things in same situation, I hope somebody else can commit them here too.\n\nAt first, for the request builders, there are SearchRequestBuilder, CountRequestBuilder and DeleteByQueryRequestBuilder which are sharing a group of methods with same name due to the completely same functions. Thus, currently, I have to define 3 methods for the separated 3 types if I want to add some common search define on the request(especially for adding routing by common logic).\n\nSecondly, for the QueryBuilders and FilterBuilders, they are in 99% similarity logically and they are in 99% similarity in the real source but there are only separated interfaces for each other of query and filter. Hence, I have to define 2 methods for the separated 2 types if I want to create a common query define for some common business data structure.\n\nI believe both of the above situations can be addressed by defining higher level interfaces.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
