I believe this was broken sometime when moving stuff to test-resources\n- rest resources are applied in an inconsistent way: you get a test-resource folder named `target/dev-tools/rest-api-spec` which means resources are rooted under `/api` and `/test`\n- on the other hand plugin rest resources are situated under `src/test/resources` with resources rooted under `rest-api-spec/api` and `rest-api-spec/test` and so on: totally inconsistent.\n\nI am willing to fix all this up, so that it works from IDEs everywhere intuitively out of box, because I do think its important, but it is a significant amount of work and I don't want to just have to do it again in a few weeks because something like gradle is introduced. Things like IDE support are not tested by jenkins so I give a 100% chance I would have to redo everything again.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/148807225","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14109#issuecomment-148807225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14109","id":148807225,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODgwNzIyNQ==","user":{"login":"dweiss","id":199470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQ3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/199470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dweiss","html_url":"https://github.com/dweiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dweiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dweiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dweiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dweiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dweiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dweiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dweiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dweiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dweiss/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-16T18:59:50Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T18:59:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm... these tests do work for me out of the box on 2.0.0.rc1.
