When Kibana recieves the POST request from the idP (with browser as the mediating agent), elasticsearch has already logged user out of the system, i.e. tokens are invalidated. That is, in terms of workflow, both the HTTP-Redirect and the HTTP-POST requests come into play at exactly the same position. \r\n\r\nFor HTTP-Redirect, Kibana simply ignores it. So as a minimal effort, the HTTP-POST binding can be supported in the same way, i.e. just add a POST route to logout for Kibana and ignore the incoming request.\r\n\r\n~IIUC, handling the `LogoutResponse` from the idP makes it possible to achieve chaining logout from other SPs, e.g. another Kibana instance that is using the same SAML session. This could be a valid use case.~ (edit: This is incorrect. The `LogoutResponse` is sent back to the initiating SP at the end of single logout. The cascading (front-channel) single logout is realised with a series of `LogoutRequest` sent from the idP, which I think we already support via the `/_security/saml/invalidate` API.)\r\n\r\nIn summary, this issue by itself can be fixed trivially. A more involved fix on the elasticsearch side can be leverage for both this issue and #40901.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
