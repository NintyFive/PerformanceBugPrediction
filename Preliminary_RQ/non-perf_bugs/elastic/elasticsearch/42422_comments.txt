Is just didn't get around to look into this further.\r\n\r\nThe search results order is the same for me. However, I would argue that elastic.co should be the very first hit.\r\n\r\nThe underlying problem I really see is that in the field we too often encounter clusters with all nodes having all roles (default) and `minimum_master_nodes: 1` (default) (I am aware that this problem will go away with ES 7).\r\n\r\nIn terms of the docs, I find that the actual recommendation of running three dedicated master-eligible nodes is missing. I feel that other recommendations (run dedicated master-eligible nodes in the first place) are hidden between the lines (within what you have quoted). I would like these recommendations and best practices to be more explicit.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to read is something like the following:\r\n\r\n> ## Dedicated master nodes\r\n> \r\n> In larger deployments, we recommend running three dedicated master-eligible nodes and removing the `master` role from all remaining nodes of the cluster. This is important for the stability of the cluster. (Then go on to also mention `minimum_master_nodes` for ES <= 6). (Maybe give some more explanation as to why this is so important).\r\n> \r\n> (Add in here: excerpt from the docs that you posted)\r\n> ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/499094180","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42422#issuecomment-499094180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42422","id":499094180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTA5NDE4MA==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-05T13:57:47Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T13:57:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @fkelbert, I see what you mean.
