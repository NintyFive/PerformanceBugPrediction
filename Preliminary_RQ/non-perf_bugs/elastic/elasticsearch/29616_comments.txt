The cluster health API with indices specified will wait for up to a default timeout of 30s for those indices to exist in the cluster state. While the cluster health API has the ability to specify a different timeout, the cat health API does not. This is a larger issue: #9375\r\n\r\nAs such, there is no issue here and I am closing this one in favor of #9375.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
