The current behavior is not to include tokens that are shorter than the min_gram setting.  For example when the min_gram is set to three, tokens that are less than three characters are not emitted.  This is forcing users to use very small settings to make shorter tokens searchable.\r\n\r\nThere is also a `preserveOriginal` setting but setting this to true does not change the output.  However, while this would solve the shorter token problem, it would also include tokens that are greater than the max_gram size which may not be desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"astefan","id":893749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/893749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan","html_url":"https://github.com/astefan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
