There is already some tension about the verbosity of the responses that I would like not to increase.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/374076124","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23858#issuecomment-374076124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23858","id":374076124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDA3NjEyNA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T01:26:10Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T01:26:10Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-search-aggs","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/399228766","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23858#issuecomment-399228766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23858","id":399228766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTIyODc2Ng==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T20:16:02Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T20:16:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"discussed it FixItFriday and agree with @jpountz arguments.
