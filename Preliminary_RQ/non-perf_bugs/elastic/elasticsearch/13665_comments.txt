Any slash that should not be used as a path separator in a uri should be properly escaped, and it is wrong to try and make distinctions between the different slashes on the server side depending on what surrounds them, that heuristic is not going to fly (in fact it didn't :) )\n\nWe are going to revert the initial fix then, the solution to this problem is to escape the '/' in the url like this: `curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/<logstash-{now%2Fd}>/animals/1'`. That is going to work and didn't require any fix in the first place.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
