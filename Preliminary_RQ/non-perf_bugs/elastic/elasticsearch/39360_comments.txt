We can not implement every feature that appears useful, nor every feature asked for by popular demand. We have design goals and a development philosophy, and we try to orient our efforts towards features that meet our goals consistent with our philosophy. For this one, it can be done entirely client side, with doing it on the server adding no value whatsoever. Yet, doing so would increase the surface area of our APIs. Among other constraints, we aim to add surface area to our APIs only when they add significant value, and are complex to do client side. A feature that we say yes to is hard for us to ever take back; we have to maintain it at the expense of other features. This one does not cross those thresholds for us.
