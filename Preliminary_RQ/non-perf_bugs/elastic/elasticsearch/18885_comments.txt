It checks reference equality instead of logical equality, which is an issue since the data might go over the network, so reference equality does not work.\n\nThis has been fixed in 2.0+ thanks to the cleanups in #12127 but I cannot backport it since it has some bw breaks. I will open a PR shortly.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/226198314","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18885#issuecomment-226198314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18885","id":226198314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjE5ODMxNA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-15T14:08:57Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T14:08:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed via #18893.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
