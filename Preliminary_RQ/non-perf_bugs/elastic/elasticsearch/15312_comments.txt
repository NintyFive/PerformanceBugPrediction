What's happening is that index creation fails as locks cannot be obtained for allocating shards (I'm not sure why that is). \n\nThat's a good question and probably the source of this trouble\n\n> What this entails is that the PrimaryShardAllocator does not treat these unassigned shards as \"new index creation\" anymore, but requires that shard data is available before assigning them.\n\nI think this will be fixed by #15281 or a follow up where we wouldn't need the allocatedPostIndexCreate() flag for primary allocations as the activeAllocaitonId will tell us.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/162888260","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15312#issuecomment-162888260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15312","id":162888260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Mjg4ODI2MA==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T14:02:22Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T14:02:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"and
