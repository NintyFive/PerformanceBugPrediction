This optimization is only applied if time fields for `date_histogram` and `sync` are the same. It wasn't possible to generalize #54254 for different time fields.\r\n\r\nThe refactoring in PR #58744 however makes this possible, that means it is a step towards solving this problem with a follow up PR after #58744 has been merged.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
