the 2.x branch, the `TransportNodesAction` class defines two methods:\n\n```\n    protected String[] filterNodeIds(DiscoveryNodes nodes, String[] nodesIds) {\n        return nodesIds;\n    }\n\n    protected String[] resolveNodes(NodesRequest request, ClusterState clusterState) {\n        return clusterState.nodes().resolveNodesIds(request.nodesIds());\n    }\n```\n\nwhich basically return all the nodes in the cluster (`resolveNodes`) and just the nodes IDs received as parameter (`filterNodeIds`), respectively.\n\nThe constructor, though, does the following:\n\n```\n            String[] nodesIds = resolveNodes(request, clusterState);\n            this.nodesIds = filterNodeIds(clusterState.nodes(), nodesIds);\n            ImmutableOpenMap<String, DiscoveryNode> nodes = clusterState.nodes().nodes();\n            this.nodes = new DiscoveryNode[nodesIds.length];\n            for (int i = 0; i < nodesIds.length; i++) {\n                this.nodes[i] = nodes.get(nodesIds[i]);\n            }\n            this.responses = new AtomicReferenceArray<>(this.nodesIds.length);\n        }\n```\n\nSo, the list of nodes - `this.nodes[i] = nodes.get(nodesIds[i]);` - is being built considering the result of `resolveNodes()` method (meaning all the nodes), not on the filtered list of nodes (the result of `filterNodeIds` method), which should be the desired behavior.\n","closed_by":{"login":"brwe","id":4320215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjAyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4320215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe","html_url":"https://github.com/brwe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
