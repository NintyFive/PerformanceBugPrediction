I think this happens because method valueOf is overloaded and first method in the overloaded method list uses long[] as method parameter.\r\nI added java.util.BitSet class to whitelist for painless.\r\nExpected: script execute the method so that instance of BitSet is created.\r\n\r\nI found the issue #18385 and it should be fixed. I suspect that this fix was added to ES 5.x\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Create a painless script that does \"BitSet.valueOf(some_byte_array)\"\r\n 2. Run script\r\n 3. Get exception that byte[] cannot be cast to long[]\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
