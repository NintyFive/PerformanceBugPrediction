Defaults to 2.\n\nOur documentation on the above parameter is quite light today.  A lot of users are interpreting the above option as one that affects relocation of shards in general.  But in reality, the above only affects the relocation of shards due to imbalancing (based on weight calculations), but will not affect shard movements that are triggered by a shard not being allowed to stay on a node (eg. via the .require, .include, .exclude parameters of shard allocation filtering that is often used by the curator).  It will be nice to add documentation around this. \n","closed_by":{"login":"abeyad","id":1631297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzEyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1631297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad","html_url":"https://github.com/abeyad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
