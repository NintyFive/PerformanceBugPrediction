We are using `ESIntegTestCase` for our unit tests, and it looks like it does not have the proper file permissions for our test directories. The only way we found so far to be able to run unit tests is to specify our own policy at runtime using `-Djava.security.policy=my_policy`.\nYou can find more information in my post on discuss: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/permission-denied-error-in-plugin-for-es-2-2-0/40915/4?u=renaud1\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/197280392","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16427#issuecomment-197280392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16427","id":197280392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzI4MDM5Mg==","user":{"login":"mrgambal","id":1752944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTI5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1752944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrgambal","html_url":"https://github.com/mrgambal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrgambal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrgambal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrgambal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrgambal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrgambal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrgambal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrgambal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrgambal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrgambal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-16T11:49:26Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T11:49:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rjernst this issue is a duplicate for #16459 and it has been already fixed in v2.2.1.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
