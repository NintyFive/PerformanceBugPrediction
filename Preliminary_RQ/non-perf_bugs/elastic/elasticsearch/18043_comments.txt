This is still certainly possible. Some folks brought it up when I started work on the `_reindex` API and I said \"I'll do it after index and create are done\" and I never did.\n\nI'm busy doing other stuff and will probably try and work on \"reindex from a remote cluster\" before I pick this up, but I'll get it eventually.

I grew to love it being a plugin because:\n1. I can be sure that nothing depends on it. It is a \"dead end\" as far as code goes. That makes it easier to reason about.\n2. When you change only it you can usually just run a small-ish number of tests. This is kind of a result of point 1 but it still lovely.\n3. It serves as an example of how you can add fairly extensive functionality in a plugin. You can point people at it and say \"plugins can make whole new actions and stuff!\" This is a bit of a cheat because I changed core to make writing the plugin easier, but it is still nice!\n\nSo when it came time to \"merge\" it to core I just made it into a module so it was shipped with core by default and still super self contained.\n\nI think if you wanted to move delete-by-query to reindex's infrastructure you'd just implement it in the reindex module. It really isn't conceptually any different from reindex.\n\nBTW, I'd be really excited if `_delete_by_query` just ended up being the same thing as `_update_by_query` with `op_type` set to delete. Reindex could reuse that! It'd be cool! I think.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
