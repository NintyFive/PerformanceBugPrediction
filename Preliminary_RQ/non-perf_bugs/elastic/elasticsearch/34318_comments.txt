The PAC data provides the security identifiers (SIDs) for the principals groups, but the SIDs are not really usable by themselves. Instead we need to resolve the SID to the group DN, which would require native calls using something like JNA or an LDAP query. If we're going to be using LDAP anyway, it makes more sense to use lookup realms and we can resolve the groups that way.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
