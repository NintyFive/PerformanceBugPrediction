There is indeed a bug in the validation since we should accept copying between two fields that are under the same nested object. However your mapping has another problem which is that it copies to a multi-field, which is not necessary since multi-fields are already populated with the value of their parent field. I'll fix the issue and improve the error message in case of multi-fields.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/331874926","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26763#issuecomment-331874926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26763","id":331874926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTg3NDkyNg==","user":{"login":"osthus-co","id":4667239,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjcyMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4667239?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osthus-co","html_url":"https://github.com/osthus-co","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osthus-co/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osthus-co/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osthus-co/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osthus-co/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osthus-co/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osthus-co/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osthus-co/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osthus-co/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osthus-co/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-25T13:07:12Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T13:07:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for the explanation and the fix.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/406197584","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26763#issuecomment-406197584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26763","id":406197584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjE5NzU4NA==","user":{"login":"aliabbas-2012","id":2234215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzQyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2234215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aliabbas-2012","html_url":"https://github.com/aliabbas-2012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aliabbas-2012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aliabbas-2012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aliabbas-2012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aliabbas-2012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aliabbas-2012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aliabbas-2012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aliabbas-2012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aliabbas-2012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aliabbas-2012/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-19T08:28:27Z","updated_at":"2018-07-19T08:29:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"is this fixed on 6.3 current version I am facing same error in following mapping\r\n``PUT twitter/_mapping/doc/\r\n{\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"priority\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\r\n      \"copy_to\": \"teams.priority\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"teams\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"nested\",\r\n       \"properties\":{\r\n          \"id\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"integer\",\r\n            \"index\": true\r\n          },\r\n          \"priority\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"integer\",\r\n            \"index\": true\r\n          }\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n  \r\n``","performed_via_github_app":null}]
