It is an optimized query mode used internally when only a single shard is involved.  In fact, we're going to remove the ability to set `query_and_fetch` in the REST API - being able to specify it provides no advantage at all.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/74207452","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9606#issuecomment-74207452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9606","id":74207452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MjA3NDUy","user":{"login":"dobariya","id":10497122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk3MTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10497122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya","html_url":"https://github.com/dobariya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-13T05:32:12Z","updated_at":"2015-02-13T05:32:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @clintongormley \n\nYes that make sense.Please let me know if search type=scan will be a good practice to implement for the above mentioned code?
