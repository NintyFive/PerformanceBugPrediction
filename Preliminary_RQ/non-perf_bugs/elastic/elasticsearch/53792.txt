version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): 6.8.6 / 7.6.0\r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\nTrying to change the value of `index_in_parent` seems to succeed, but doesn't.\r\nI would expect that it is working as designed that that value cannot be changed, but I think it's a bug that no error is returned when trying to change it.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n```\r\nPUT /parenttest\r\n```\r\n```\r\nPUT /parenttest/_mapping/_doc\r\n{\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"email\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"keyword\"\r\n    },\r\n\r\n            \"user\" : {\r\n                \"type\" : \"nested\",\r\n

parenttest\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Expected behaviour:*\r\nThe third `PUT` returns an error explaining that it's not possible to change the value of \"include_in_parent\"\r\n\r\n*Observed Behaviour:*\r\nNone of the calls throws an error.\r\nThe second `GET` returns exactly the same data as the first.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
