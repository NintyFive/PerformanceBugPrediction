We have released a low level REST client that allows to communicate with Elasticsearch via http and requires minimal dependencies. We are working on a high level REST client that helps with building requests and reading responses, but that one will still depend on Elasticsearch, at least in the beginning.\r\nSee https://www.elastic.co/blog/state-of-the-official-elasticsearch-java-clients .\r\n\r\nWe would like to minimize the dependencies needed by the high level REST client as well, but we are now focussing on getting out the high level REST client and have its requests and responses compatible with the java API that many users have used up until now. Later, we will work on further improvements, but it will take time to have the high level client completely independent and with a minimal set of dependencies. We certainly won't to this for the `TransportClient` which is going to be replaced by the high level REST client.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
