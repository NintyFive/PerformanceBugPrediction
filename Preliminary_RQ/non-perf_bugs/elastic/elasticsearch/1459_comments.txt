You would return this field for every search hit and use for display only if no highlights are found.

Yes it looks like a duplicate of #1171 , where we are trying to add support for returning non highlighted fragments in case there's nothing to highlight. The tricky bit there is how to generate the excerpt. Returning the first sentence seems like a good idea but it should not be the only option available, as it wouldn't respect the expected length of the fragments.\n\nClosing this one, I would suggest folks to have a look at #1171 and move the discussion there. Feedback is appreciated!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
