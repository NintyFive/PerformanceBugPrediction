I want to make sure we're catering to the BI user _in addition to_ the Java developer.  The Java developer I expect to be comfortable with plugging our maven repo into their IDE of choice and pulling down the artifacts there.  The BI user/admin I expect to have _almost_ no idea what Java is.  I expect they'll want some kind of single zip containing everything they need to dump into some directory.  I'd love it if we could infer whether the user was using JDBC for BI use case vs for development purposes, which I _think_ we may be able to do (imperfectly) by having a separation of the two URLs.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/384133404","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29994#issuecomment-384133404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29994","id":384133404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDEzMzQwNA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-03T18:28:22Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T01:36:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"*Original comment by @nik9000:*\n\nUntil we bundle all of the dependencies into the JDBC driver maven won't give users a single easy to download spot. So we've decided to build a zip. The process of setting up the zip with dbvisualizer, for example, is to download the zip, unzip it, and point dbvisualizer to all the files in the expanded directory.
