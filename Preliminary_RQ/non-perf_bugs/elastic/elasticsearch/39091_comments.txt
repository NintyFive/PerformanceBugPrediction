For the package distributions, the default is `/var/log/elasticsearch/gc.log`.\r\n\r\n> Can I suggest a new setting of `ES_PATH_LOGS` within the `elasticsearch-env.bat` script, based on `path.logs` in `elasticsearch.yml`\r\n\r\nI would prefer that we not get into the business of parsing `elasticsearch.yml` outside of Elasticsearch itself. *Maybe* someday when we have JVM-based launcher, but most definitely not in a world where we would have to do that parsing in command line scripts.\r\n\r\nNote that there is more complexity to the Elasticsearch logs than merely the `path.logs` settings. Their location can also be controlled through `log4j2.properties`.
