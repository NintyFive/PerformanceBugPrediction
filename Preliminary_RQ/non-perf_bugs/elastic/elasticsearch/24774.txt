This is problematic when attempting to get the next page.\r\n\r\nThis is my post in the forums and an image that shows the problem:\r\n\r\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/t/sort-by-dynamic-fields-and-use-search-after/86275\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/MLi3P\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1. Create an index with a dynamic field mapping\r\n 2. Add some documents that contain a dynamic field and some that do not\r\n 3. Issue a match all query and sort by the dynamic field that was created in step 2 and the UID.\r\n 4. In the last hits, you will see that the `sort` property contains \"Infinity\" in the first position\r\n 5. Use that `sort` value as the `search_after` value to fetch the next page of results\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
