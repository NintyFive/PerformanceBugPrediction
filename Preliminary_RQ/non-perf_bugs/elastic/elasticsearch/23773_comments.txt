That said, those are the internal messages nodes sent to each other (each network request is logged as a task). There are so many of them that this will be a monumental task to go and document them all. On top of it it, they change from time to time and I don't think we're ready to commit to keeping documentation up to date. As said, I would love to have it but I don't think it's realistic for this to happen any time soon. I'm going to close as won't fix.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
