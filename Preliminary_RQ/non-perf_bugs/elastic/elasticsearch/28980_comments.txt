I see the same bahaviour on 5.6.8 using your reproduction example. I also tried 6.2.4 (our latest release) and the filter in the function score query is not accepted. The problem must have been fixed somewhere along the 6.x line. I will try to see if I find an issue that shows which exact version this was fixed.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/386651557","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28980#issuecomment-386651557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28980","id":386651557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjY1MTU1Nw==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-04T16:17:50Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T16:17:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I also checked this on 6.0 and the problem is also fixed there. From the code it looks like in 6.x we always translate the `terms` query to a Lucene TermInSetQuery or something provided by the field mapper (in the field of integer values, we seem to use PointInSetQuery. @TwP I hope you don't mind if I close this issue as I don't think this is something that will be backported to 5.x, and also given that it can be worked around setting a higher `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count`.\r\nThanks again and please reopen if you think this should be dicussed further.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
