Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/358633926","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28293#issuecomment-358633926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28293","id":358633926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODYzMzkyNg==","user":{"login":"hhovhann","id":8037634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzc2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8037634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhovhann","html_url":"https://github.com/hhovhann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhovhann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhovhann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhovhann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhovhann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhovhann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhovhann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhovhann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhovhann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhovhann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-18T12:35:59Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T12:35:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks,\r\nHere is https://discuss.elastic.co/t/creating-an-index-with-mappings-and-analysis-doesnt-work/116048","performed_via_github_app":null}]
