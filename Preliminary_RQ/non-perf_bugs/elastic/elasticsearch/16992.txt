As reported in https://github.com/elastic/cookbook-elasticsearch/issues/441, the init script for [deb](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/distribution/deb/src/main/packaging/init.d/elasticsearch#L146) packaging runs `mkdir` on `$DATA_DIR`. This seems to make it impossible to use the init script for a multivalued `path.data` configuration.\n\nShould we be checking for a comma or doing something else creative with `$DATA_DIR` before calling `mkdir`? Currently, this init script can produce a single directory named `/foo,/bar`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
