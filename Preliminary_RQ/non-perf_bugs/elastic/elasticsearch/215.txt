The idea is that values are rounded into the closest bucket based on the interval provided (for example, for interval `100`, then `1055` will be rounded to `1000`) and then for each bucket the count, total, and mean values are provided.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```\n{\n    query : {\n        \"match_all\" : {}\n    },\n    facets : {\n        \"histo1\" : {\n            \"histogram\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"multi_num\",\n                \"interval\" : 100\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
