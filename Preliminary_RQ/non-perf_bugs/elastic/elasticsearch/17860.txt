This creates some problems when I retrieve the documents by using the NEST CLIENT.\n\nBut NEST is not the issue here.\n\nWhen I execute a scripted update, which makes a arithmetic operation, explodes when the value to read from Elastic is a string.\n\nThe original value is in ES is a number and we execute the update, the result is written as String. Then,  when I execute it again, crashes because cannot perform arithmetic operations over a string.\n\nI would expect that in ES a number is always represented as a number, not as string.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n 1- Create index with mappings:\n\n`\nPUT index1 \n{ \"mappings\": { \"Report\": { \"properties\": { \"workingTime\": { \"type\": \"double\" } } } } }\n`\n\n 2- Create demo document:\n\n`POST index1/Report/1\n{\n    \"workingTime\": 9996\n  }`\n\n 3- Update the document\n\n`\nPOST index1/Report/1/_update\n{\n  \"script\": {\n      \"inline\": \"ctx._source.workingTime = ctx._source.workingTime/1000\"    \n  }\n}\n`\n\n 4- Update (again) the document\n\n`\nPOST index1/Report/1/_update\n{\n  \"script\": {\n      \"inline\": \"ctx._source.workingTime = ctx._source.workingTime/1000\"\n      }\n}\n`\n\n5- Illegal argument exception comes\n\n`\n{\n   \"error\": {\n      \"root_cause\": [\n         {\n            \"type\": \"remote_transport_exception\",\n            \"reason\": \"[Yeti][127.0.0.1:9300][indices:data/write/update[s]]\"\n         }\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"illegal_argument_exception\",\n      \"reason\": \"failed to execute script\",\n      \"caused_by\": {\n         \"type\": \"script_exception\",\n         \"reason\": \"failed to run inline script [ctx._source.workingTime = ctx._source.workingTime/1000] using lang [groovy]\",\n         \"caused_by\": {\n            \"type\": \"missing_method_exception\",\n            \"reason\": \"No signature of method: java.lang.String.div() is applicable for argument types: (java.lang.Integer) values: [1000]\\nPossible solutions: is(java.lang.Object), drop(int), wait(), trim(), any(), size()\"\n         }\n      }\n   },\n   \"status\": 400\n}\n`\n\n6- (extra) \n\nWhen we use as document\n\n`POST index1/Report/1\n{\n    \"workingTime\": 999.6\n  }\n`\n\n, the problem does not happen.\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n\n**Describe the feature**:\n\nMapping Issues / Scripting issues\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
