nanoseconds, got: \" + taskExecutionNanos;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the method that is used to get `taskExecutionNanos` is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    long getTotalExecutionNanos() {\r\n        if (startTimeNanos == -1 || finishTimeNanos == -1) {\r\n            // There must have been an exception thrown, the total time is unknown (-1)\r\n            return -1;\r\n        }\r\n        return Math.max(finishTimeNanos - startTimeNanos, 1);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it looks like that assertion will fail if an exception occurs that results in the total time of a task being unknown.","closed_by":{"login":"williamrandolph","id":3253644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTM2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3253644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph","html_url":"https://github.com/williamrandolph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
