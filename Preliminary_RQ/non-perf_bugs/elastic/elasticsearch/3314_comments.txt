You need to remove old version of the plugin and install appropriate version of the plugin. If you are using elasticsearch 0.90.2, you can do it by running the following commands from elasticsearch home directory:\n\n```\n$ bin/plugin -remove analysis-morphology\n$ bin/plugin -install analysis-morphology -url http://dl.bintray.com/content/imotov/elasticsearch-plugins/elasticsearch-analysis-morphology-1.1.0.zip\n```\n\nIf you still have any problems with it, please open an issue in the [elasticsearch-analysis-morphology](https://github.com/imotov/elasticsearch-analysis-morphology) project.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
