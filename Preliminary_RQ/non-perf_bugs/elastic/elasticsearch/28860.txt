Attempting to start fails with error 4. Logs show: \"The system could not find the environment option that was entered\". Running from console works fine both elevated and non-elevated. JAVA_HOME environment variable is set for the SYSTEM. Rolling back to elasticsearch v6.1.1 alleviates the problem. After upgrading to 6.2.2 the windows service was \"remove\"d and re\"install\"ed. I also tried to delete and re-add the environment variable JAVA_HOME with reboots just for good measure.\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n- Upgrade to Elasticsearch 6.2.2 from Elasticsearch 6.1.1\r\n- remove existing service and install as new\r\n- try to start service\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1.\r\n 2.\r\n 3.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
