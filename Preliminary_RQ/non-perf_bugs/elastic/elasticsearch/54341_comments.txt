edge-ngram tokenizer which only tokenizes on whitespace so that given `hel.o wo/rld` we get the tokens `he`, `he.`, `hel.`, `hel.o`, `wo`, `wo/`, `wo/r`, `wo/rl`, `wo/rld`.\r\n\r\nWhy can't you use a `whitespace` tokenizer and an `edge-ngram` filter?\r\n```\r\nPUT test-index\r\n{\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"analysis\": {\r\n      \"filter\": {\r\n        \"my_filter\": {\r\n          \"type\":

tokens??\r\n\r\nThat configuration is a bit weird, but yes, thats what it does. E.g. \r\n```\r\nUT test-index\r\n{\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"analysis\": {\r\n      \"tokenizer\": {\r\n        \"my_tokenizer\": {\r\n          \"token_chars\" : [\"whitespace\"],\r\n          \"type\": \"edge_ngram\",\r\n          \"min_gram\": 1,\r\n          \"max_gram\": 20\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST test-index/_analyze\r\n{\r\n  \"tokenizer\": \"my_tokenizer\",\r\n  \"text\": \"Quick brown fox\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nreturns two whitespace token. One can argue about how useful that is but the character class is usually used in conjunction with something else.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.
