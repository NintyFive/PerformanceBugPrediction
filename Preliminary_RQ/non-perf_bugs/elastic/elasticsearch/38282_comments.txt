I.e. on 6.3.x -> 6.4.0 (or 6.6.0) transition a change was added that started requiring coordinates as floats in GeoJSON - my code had them as strings and I didn't even realize. What ES returned as error was https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/68149b6058a720ec891974e8a6982c5e480fb9f1/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/mapper/GeoShapeFieldMapper.java#L122  which only let me know of the name of the single shape field in the document and I had to debug the request manually to find the cause.
