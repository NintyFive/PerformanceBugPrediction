Once a day or two I get into a red state with a handful of unassigned shards and have to use the reroute api to get them assigned.\n\nI was able to find the following line from the logs on the master node:\n\n[2014-06-18 20:19:10,644][WARN ][cluster.action.shard     ] [prod-sidekiq2] [1815_2014_18][1] received shard failed for [1815_2014_18][1], node[eMYIqhQTR0S1m4UeRJlLxg], [P], s[INITIALIZING], indexUUID [uHW84Y49Qg2KTZnI9dmLJw], reason [Failed to start shard, message [IndexShardGatewayRecoveryException[[1815_2014_18][1] failed to fetch index version after copying it over]; nested: IndexShardGatewayRecoveryException[[1815_2014_18][1] shard allocated for local recovery (post api), should exist, but doesn't, current files: [segments.gen, _checksums-1399837226100]]; nested: FileNotFoundException[segments_8]; ]]\n\nI found issue #4674, which sounds very similar as I am using multi data paths, but I'm running 1.0.0 so I guess the fix for this got into that release.\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9200\n{\n  \"status\" : 200,\n  \"name\" : \"prod-es3\",\n  \"version\" : {\n    \"number\" : \"1.0.0\",\n    \"build_hash\" : \"a46900e9c72c0a623d71b54016357d5f94c8ea32\",\n    \"build_timestamp\" : \"2014-02-12T16:18:34Z\",\n    \"build_snapshot\" : false,\n    \"lucene_version\" : \"4.6\"\n  },\n  \"tagline\" : \"You Know, for Search\"\n}\n```\n\nAny one have any suggestions as to how this might be diagnosed/fixed?\n\nWould this issue be resolved with an upgrade to 1.0.3 or 1.2.?\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
