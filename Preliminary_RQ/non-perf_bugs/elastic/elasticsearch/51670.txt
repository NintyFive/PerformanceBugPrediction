This leaves a large surface area of binaries and libraries that we don’t need, but exposes us to noisy vulnerability scans (with issues that don’t actually impact the security of the image). We haven’t made much of an effort to slim this surface area down.\r\n\r\nOne reason we chose this image over others (e.g., Ubuntu-derived images) is perceived better support of the JDK, because Red Hat has long been heavily involved in OpenJDK. This reason is a non-factor, now that we use the bundled JDK in the images. There was also a desire to have consistency with other images in the stack. I’m less convinced of the value of this compared to other factors but it is something to keep in our minds.\r\n\r\nNote that a non-goal for this issue is to reduce the physical size of the image. While that is something to consider and will likely result from reducing the surface area of the image, it is separate to this issue to consider reducing the physical size of the image.","closed_by":{"login":"pugnascotia","id":8696382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTYzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8696382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia","html_url":"https://github.com/pugnascotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
