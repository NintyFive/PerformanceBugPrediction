I am using AWS ElasticSearch service.\r\n\r\nInitially, I started development locally on ElasticSearch 7.4 downloaded from the official site. Everything worked fine, until I created an aws ES cluster and deployed my code. It seems that mapping doesn't work as expected on the cloud version  with the following reason:  \r\n```\r\n\"caused_by\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"mapper_parsing_exception\",\r\n      \"reason\": \"No handler for type [dense_vector] declared on field [stext_sbert_nli]\"\r\n    } \r\n\r\n```\r\nI am attaching GET /  information for the cloud cluster.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\" : \"\",\r\n  \"cluster_name\" : \"\",\r\n  \"cluster_uuid\" : \"\",\r\n  \"version\" : {\r\n    \"number\" : \"7.4.2\",\r\n    \"build_flavor\" : \"oss\",\r\n    \"build_type\" : \"tar\",\r\n    \"build_hash\" : \"unknown\",\r\n    \"build_date\" : \"2020-05-05T04:47:22.951128Z\",\r\n    \"build_snapshot\" : false,\r\n    \"lucene_version\" : \"8.2.0\",\r\n    \"minimum_wire_compatibility_version\" : \"6.8.0\",\r\n    \"minimum_index_compatibility_version\" : \"6.0.0-beta1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"tagline\" : \"You Know, for Search\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nI find it frustrating that the cloud managed solutions are advertised to give you the full experience. Even though dense vector was added in 7.1, even on 7.4 I cannot use it... Can you kindly let me know if there's any option I have to enable that feature?\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
