All of our scripts should do that - including `bin/plugin` and any scripts we package as into plugins. I don't know that we should go so far as to automatically add it as part of the build process, but we should really make an effort to source the file in all the scripts.\n\nThis would allow:\n1. We could move all the `/etc/sysconfig` et al handling into it rather than the init scripts and `bin/plugin`.\n2. External packages could have a single place to stick their version of the `/etc/sysconfig` handling.
