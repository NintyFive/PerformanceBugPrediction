it produces no results (and continues to do so no matter how long I wait). If I remove the first refresh it seems ok or if I do\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_cache/clear?id_cache=true'\n```\n\nbefore the search then I will also get a result (as discussed at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elasticsearch/oD8EKEYeZuM).
