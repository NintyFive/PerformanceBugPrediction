Elasticsearch cluster's zen discovery is good for this situation, new node join cluster did not need to restart old node for reloading config, cluster setting such as 'discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes' support dynamic updating by api. But 'gateway.recover_after_nodes' is static, and only used by the master node, when the cluster scale_in and scale_out, how i change the setting? I have to restart old nodes for loading this config.\n\nSo I think gateway.recover_after_nodes should be a cluster setting and support dynamic setting by api.\n","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
