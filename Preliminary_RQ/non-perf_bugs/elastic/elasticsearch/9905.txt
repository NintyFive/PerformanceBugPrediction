In the index there are set of documents in a given structure.\n2. search the index using searchRequestBuilder for the latest timestamp of that set.\n3. performing index update using IndexRequestBuilder with setRefresh=true on the same set with identical documents.\n4. immediately after the indexing I search again for the latest timestamp\n\nThe excepted result is to get newer timestamp on the second search, but occasionally it return same timestamp. \nPutting a sleep of few second between update and search solve the issue. \nIs there other solution for this issue beside sleep ?\nShouldn't the setRefresh=true flag guarantees that the update will be reflected in immediate query after the update ?\n\nThanks,\nUri\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
