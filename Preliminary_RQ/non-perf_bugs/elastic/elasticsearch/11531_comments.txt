There can only be one ongoing flush at a time.  We trigger flushes internally but you can also trigger it externally with the flush API. If there is already an ongoing flush when the external API is called, the API will fail and tell you that with this exception. You can ask it wait for on going flushes before returning by using the `wait_if_ongoing` parameter.  See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-flush.html#flush-parameters\n\nI'm closing this now because it seems that everything works as designed. If something is acting up, please feel fee to reopen.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
