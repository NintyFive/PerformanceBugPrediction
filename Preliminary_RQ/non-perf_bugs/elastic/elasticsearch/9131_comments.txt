I've added it to the plugins page.\n\nDeduplication is, obviously, an intensive and complex process  There is no magic lightweight solution - however you do it, you end up using the techniques that you describe in the issue description.\n\nWhile we provide tools for finding similar documents (eg the more like this API, the significant terms aggregation, etc), it feels like a full deduplication framework should be part of the ETL pipeline, rather than running on every node in an Elasticsearch cluster. For instance, it could be implemented as a plugin to Logstash where you could specify how many workers you want to dedicate to this process.  \n\nThanks for the idea, but I'd suggest opening this on the Logstash issues list instead.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
