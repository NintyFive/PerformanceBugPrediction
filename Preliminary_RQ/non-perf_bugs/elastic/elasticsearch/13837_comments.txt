Most of the tests have been moved back in their original places and converted back again into integration tests while the dependency on Groovy has been replaced by mocked scripts. It's not perfect since some tests would have benefit to be changed into unit or simplier tests but I think that's still a good move.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
