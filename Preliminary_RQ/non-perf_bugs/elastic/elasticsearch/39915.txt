always uses `UTC` as the timezone param for requests sent to the server,\r\nregardless of the `?timezone=XXX` used in the connection string.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug, as all calculations with date/times (eg. scalar functions applies on top of them like DAY_OF_MONTH)  are done with `UTC` timezone, and they potentially give wrong results, and those\r\noperations cannot be translated and fixed in the client JDBC (which still holds the correct timezone passed from the params), as the original information of the exact timestamp is lost.","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
