Furthermore, hard-linking is not the only thing going on behind the scenes (That's just used to put the initial segments into place). There's also a force-merge step that might require substantially more space (eliminating a lot of deletes that have been introduced by the split). The [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/indices-split-index.html) are also clear on this:\r\n\r\n> The node handling the split process must have sufficient free disk space to accommodate a second copy of the existing index.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
