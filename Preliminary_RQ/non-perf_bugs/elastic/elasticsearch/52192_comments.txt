We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. The following seems to work for me when the code from the parent-join module is on the classpath:\r\n```\r\nSearchSourceBuilder sb = new SearchSourceBuilder();\r\nsb.query(JoinQueryBuilders.hasChildQuery(\"type\", QueryBuilders.matchAllQuery(), ScoreMode.Avg));\r\n```\r\nI'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead if the above doesn't work.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
