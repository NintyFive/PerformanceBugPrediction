The branch can be found [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/upgrade/lucene-8). Below is the list of things to be changed/removed for the upgrade:\r\n- [x] Levenstein distance renaming.\r\n- [x] TermContext renaming (TermStates).\r\n- [x] Collectors should implement `scoreMode` instead of `needsScore`. (@jpountz)\r\n- [x] IndexSearcher#createNormalizedWeight has been removed. (@jpountz)\r\n- [x] StandardFilter removal. (@jimczi)\r\n- [x] EarlyTerminatingSortingCollector removal. (@jpountz)\r\n- [x] BoostingQuery removal (replaced with `FunctionScoreQuery#boostByQuery`). (@jimczi)\r\n- [x] Similarity#SimWeight removal. (@jpountz)\r\n- [x] BasicModel removals (`after effects`, `BE`, `D `and `P`). (@jpountz)\r\n- [x] Version#LUCENE_6* removal. (@jimczi #32937)\r\n- [x] TopDocs#totalHits rewriting.\r\n- [x] TopDocs#computeMaxScore replacement\r\n- [x] Explanation#getValue() is a Number instead of a float\r\n\r\n#### Test failures\r\n- [x] `PercolateQueryBuilder#createMultiDocumentSearcher`, `PercolatorQuerySearchIT`: @jpountz \r\n- [x] `FunctionScoreTests#testSimpleWeightedFunction`: produces negative scores (#31927)\r\n- [x] `ScriptedSimilarityTests#testBasics`, `ScriptedSimilarityTests#testInit`: score is called on non-scoring clauses (to get the max score, see ImpactsDISI)\r\n- [ ] `FieldSubsetReaderTests#testFieldNames`, `FieldSubsetReaderTests#testFieldNamesMissing`, `FieldSubsetReaderTests#testFieldThreeFields`: FieldNamesTerms return invalid statistics (e.g. -1) https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/33261\r\n- [x] `TransportTwoNodesSearchIT#testDfsQueryThenFetch`, `TransportTwoNodesSearchIT#testDfsQueryThenFetchWithSort`: new explanation format and message\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\cc @elastic/es-distributed to sync up.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
