A `function_score` query using `script_score` is now failing when using `>` or `<` operators on the `_score`.  Our script worked fine in 1.3, but after upgrading to 1.4.1 it fails with the following `GroovyRuntimeException`:\n\n> QueryPhaseExecutionException[[script_score_test][3]: query[filtered(function score (ConstantScore(_:_),function=script[if (_score > max_val) {0.0} else {_score}], params [{max_val=10.0}]))->cache(_type:my_type)],from[0],size[10]: Query Failed [Failed to execute main query]]; nested: GroovyScriptExecutionException[GroovyRuntimeException[Cannot compare org.elasticsearch.script.ScoreAccessor with value 'org.elasticsearch.script.ScoreAccessor@2553f628' and java.lang.Double with value '10.0']];\n\nNot sure if this is a bug in Groovy or we need to change our script syntax to be compatible.  Here are some sample steps to reproduce.\n\n``` javascript\nDELETE /script_score_test\nPUT /script_score_test/my_type/1\n{\n    \"prop1\" : 5.3,\n    \"prop2\" : 6.7\n}\nPUT /script_score_test/my_type/2\n{\n    \"prop1\" : 9.6,\n    \"prop2\" : 15.4\n}\n```\n\nThe following query fails:\n\n``` javascript\nGET /script_score_test/my_type/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"function_score\": {\n      \"boost_mode\": \"replace\",\n      \"script_score\": {\n        \"script\": \"if (_score < max_val) {0.0} else {_score}\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"max_val\": 10\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nInterestingly, the query works when using the `==` operator.  :\n\n``` javascript\nGET /script_score_test/my_type/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"function_score\": {\n      \"boost_mode\": \"replace\",\n      \"script_score\": {\n        \"script\": \"if (_score == max_val) {0.0} else {_score}\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"max_val\": 10\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlso, using `compareTo` seems to work:\n\n``` javascript\nGET /script_score_test/my_type/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"function_score\": {\n      \"boost_mode\": \"replace\",\n      \"script_score\": {\n        \"script\": \"if (_score.compareTo(max_val) < 0) {0.0} else {_score}\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"max_val\": 10\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe're OK with updating our scripts to use `compareTo` to make everything work, but we'd prefer to use the simpler `<` `>` syntax.  I wanted to file this issue in case it's an actual bug or in case someone else comes across it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
