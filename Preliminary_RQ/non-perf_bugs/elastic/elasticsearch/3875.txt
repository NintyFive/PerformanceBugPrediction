This allows for queries such as:\n\n\"john do*\"\n\"(john OR jane) doe\"~5\n\nThere are some earlier requests to add this to elasticsearch, in which the requester was told by kimchy to write a plugin or open an issue about it. As far as I can find, no plugins were published and no issue was made for this request, so I thought it would be best to open an issue to track the status of this request. \n\nI would be willing to write such a plugin but I don't know anything about the elastic search source code so  I'm afraid I would need a bit of hand holding. \n\nIs there already such a plugin? Are there any plans to add such a plugin? Can anyone help me write this plugin?\n\nSome Links: \nEarlier request:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elasticsearch/g5iK5TqigL0\nLucene: http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_1_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/complexPhrase/ComplexPhraseQueryParser.html\nSolr plugin: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-1604\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
