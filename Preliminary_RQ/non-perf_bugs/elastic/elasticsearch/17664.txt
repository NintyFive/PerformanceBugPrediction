Surprisingly only **part** of requests fallen down with error like this\n\n```\n   {\n    'index': {\n    '_id': '5660f26e5d47ea351743a6bc', '_index': 'contacts_v3.0__1', '_type': 'contact',\n    'error': 'RemoteTransportException[[Sprite][inet[/10.0.102.142:9300]][indices:admin/create]]; nested: IndexCreationException[[contacts_v3.0__1] failed to create index]; nested: FailedToResolveConfigException[Failed to resolve config path [templates/synonym.txt], tried file path [templates/synonym.txt], path file [/etc/elasticsearch/templates/synonym.txt], and classpath]; ',\n    'status': 500\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI index in butches of 1k docs using bulk api of pyes lib.
