We analyzed the problem and it's coming from LocalClientProvider which calls NetworkUtils.getLocalAddress() which in turns is calling InetAddress.getLocalHost(). In this case NetworkUtils stores a NULL localAddress, which makes NetworkUtils.getLocalAddress().getHostName() throw the NPE in:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    protected Settings buildNodeSettings() {\r\n        // Build settings\r\n        ImmutableSettings.Builder builder = ImmutableSettings.settingsBuilder()\r\n                .put(\"node.name\", \"node-test-\" + System.currentTimeMillis())\r\n                .put(\"node.data\", true)\r\n                .put(\"cluster.name\", \"cluster-test-\" + NetworkUtils.getLocalAddress().getHostName())\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the local address seems to be used only as the test name of the cluster, it would be nice to use a different name that is not subject to variations/limitations, i.e. that doesn't depend on some environment setup.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
