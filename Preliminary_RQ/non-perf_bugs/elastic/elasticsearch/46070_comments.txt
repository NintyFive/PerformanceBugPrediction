When a field is not included, that means we defer to the Elasticsearch dynamic mapping logic.\r\n\r\nFor certain aggregations, there is no way for us to accurate deduce their field type. A specific example of this is `scripted_metric`.\r\n\r\nI do not think we will ever include `scripted_metric` fields in this mapping. \r\n\r\nWhy not make the columns that are visible be the fields in the preview objects? We return a set number of them, so iterating through them and picking out the unique field names seems more reliable.

We can definitely fix it on the client side I was just not aware that there's a chance that fields would not be part of the mapping.
