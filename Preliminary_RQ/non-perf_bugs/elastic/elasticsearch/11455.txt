We already allow placeholders to read values from the environment/system properties. During the review, @uboness noted that it would be good to standardize the naming and cleanup the code that prompts the place holders. \n\nThe new changes mentioned in the comments of the PR are:\n- Consolidate code that handles replacing the placeholders to one place. Right now we have it in the `Settings` and the `InternalSettingsPreparer`. This logic is really internal and should not be exposed in the Settings.\n- The system placeholders should follow the same convention and be in the form: `${env::foobar}`\n- We can also introduce a new setting: `config.ignore_placeholders`:\n  This will ignore all placeholder settings:\n\n``` yaml\nconfig.ignore_placeholders: true\n```\n\nwill only ignore `env` placeholders:\n\n``` yaml\nconfig.ignore_placeholders: env\n```\n\nwill only ignore `prompt` placeholders:\n\n``` yaml\nconfig.ignore_placeholders: prompt\n```\n\nwill ignore both the `env` and `prompt` settings:\n\n``` yaml\nconfig.ignore_placeholders: env, prompt\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
