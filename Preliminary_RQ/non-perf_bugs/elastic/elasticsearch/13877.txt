I use some custom Elasticsearch plugins which need to read the value of `ES_HOME` environment variable. I use `System.getenv(\"ES_HOME\")` to read it. I've not set the value of `ES_HOME` environment variable on this machine. When I start Elasticsearch by executing `elasticsearch.bat`, the value of `ES_HOME` is correctly read. But when I install Elasticsearch service and start it using `service.bat install` and `service.bat start`, the value of `ES_HOME` is `null`. If I set `ES_HOME` environment variable on my machine, then there is no problem at all but I want to minimize the dependency on environment variables as much as possible.\n\nThis looks like a bug to me as there is discrepancy in behaviour between two launching machanisms.
