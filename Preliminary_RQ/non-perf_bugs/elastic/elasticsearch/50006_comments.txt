If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. The discussion forums are beter suited to these sorts of troubleshooting and problem diagnosis conversations.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the forums that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
