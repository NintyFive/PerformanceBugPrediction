This is fixed with the new cluster coordination subsystem in 7.0+. The logs have gone on this one, and there are no more recent failures (it's a very rare thing to happen). What happened here I think is that a committed cluster state update got lost, which is possible in the way that the  test operates:\r\n- cluster with 3 master-eligible nodes and 1 data node.\r\n- indexing with mapping updates ongoing.\r\n- current master is partitioned away from the other nodes during a cluster state publication that updates the mappings (and increments the mapping version).\r\n- data node receives a cluster state from the new master that does not take a previously committed cluster state from the previous master into account.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing we can do here.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
