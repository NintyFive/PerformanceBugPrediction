I was fixing a documentation issue (#22007), I looked at the code and discovered that we actually never read what the user entered as a `readonly` parameter when he creates an azure repository.\r\n\r\nSo if someone sends:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT _snapshot/my_backup4\r\n{\r\n    \"type\": \"azure\",\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"account\": \"my_account2\",\r\n        \"location_mode\": \"primary_only\",\r\n        \"readonly\": true\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe repository is not actually defined as `readonly`.\r\n\r\nIt's caused by the fact we are always overwriting `readonly`setting based on `location_mode`.\r\nIf a user sets it to `primary_only`, `readonly` is forced to `false`.\r\nIf a user sets it to `primary_then_secondary`, `readonly` is forced to `false`.\r\nIf a user sets it to `secondary_only`, `readonly` is forced to `false`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
