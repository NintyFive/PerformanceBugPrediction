For example, to install the output of a `gradle release` run, one can use (assuming extracted under `build/distributions`):\n\n```\n build/distributions/elasticsearch-0.15.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/plugin -url build/distributions/plugins/ -install lang-groovy\n```\n\nThe `-url` parameter accepts either a file based location, or a url. For file based location, the structure supported is either a flat dir with the plugin(s) there, or a `plugin-name/plugin-file` structure.\n\nNote, this is a breaking change since now one can only list a single plugin name in `-install`, though it can be repeated several times to install several plugins in a single command.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
