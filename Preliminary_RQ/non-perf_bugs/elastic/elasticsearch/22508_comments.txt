Ideally, this limit could be set per context since I don't think we want people to have a higher limit for search where it doesn't make sense.  I'm also very hesitant to make this a runtime compiler option since it would allow an outsider to pretty much run an infinite loop.  A quick fix would be simply upping the limit to something like 100000 instead of 10000.  But maybe this should be an ES setting per context?
