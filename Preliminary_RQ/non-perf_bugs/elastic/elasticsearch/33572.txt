Bug report -->\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): 6.4.0\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**\r\nIn DocValueFieldsFetchSubPhase.java, we use the deprecation logger inside of a per-field loop, emitting a log message (and corresponding HTTP header) for each `docvalue_fields` item without a `format` parameter in an msearch query.  For users running Elasticsearch behind a proxy, this has been breaking as we can emit potentially many of these headers as Kibana is used normally.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the offending deprecation log message:\r\n`#! Deprecation: Doc-value field [date2] is not using a format. The output will change in 7.0 when doc value fields get formatted based on mappings by default. It is recommended to pass [format=use_field_mapping] with the doc value field in order to opt in for the future behaviour and ease the migration to 7.0.\r\n`\r\n\r\nWe should refactor this class so that a single warning is emitted that enumerates all offending fields.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
