yes, we'd like this. Mostly. But it feels like a fair bit of work to build and would go out of date pretty quickly unless we have some way of automatically checking that it lines up with what our mappings support. And none of us have any good ideas on how to do that....\r\n\r\nGiven that this issue hasn't seen a lot of discussion in two years I'm going to close it. But if anyone has any good ideas about how to keep these up to date then reply and reopen. I'm thinking more of a way to automatically test what we'd write rather than generate code. We *tend* to prefer that sort of thing.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
