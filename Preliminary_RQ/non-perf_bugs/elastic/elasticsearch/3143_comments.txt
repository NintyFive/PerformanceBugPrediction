That's because the java api classes are actually used internally for node-to-node communication, using our own optimized binary protocol instead of json. That means that in most of the cases we create the request builders given the json on the node that receives the request, and we never need to translate requests back to json. There are exceptions, like the `SearchRequestBuilder`, and you can identify the classes that are easily representable in json format as those that implement the `ToXContent` interface. In general we do that only when needed by elasticsearch itself internally.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/24301782","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3143#issuecomment-24301782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3143","id":24301782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzAxNzgy","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-12T08:14:39Z","updated_at":"2013-09-12T08:14:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing this one since as mentioned before `MultiGetRequestBuilder` doesn't easily map back to json and it doesn't make much sense to change this only to have toString method that returns json.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
