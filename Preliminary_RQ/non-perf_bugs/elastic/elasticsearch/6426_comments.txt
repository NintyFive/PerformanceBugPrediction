Can it be that that one of your nodes is on an older ES version? \n\nTo help investigating further: can you elaborate more about your setup? are you using client nodes? is all of your cluster on the same ES version? I assume the gists are just a reproduction of the query generated by FOSElastica, are you sure they are accurate?\n\nCheers,\nBoaz\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/58009219","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6426#issuecomment-58009219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6426","id":58009219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDA5MjE5","user":{"login":"yellow1912","id":374134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/374134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellow1912","html_url":"https://github.com/yellow1912","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellow1912/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellow1912/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellow1912/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellow1912/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellow1912/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellow1912/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellow1912/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellow1912/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yellow1912/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-06T12:22:46Z","updated_at":"2014-10-06T12:22:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I no longer get this with latest version\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
