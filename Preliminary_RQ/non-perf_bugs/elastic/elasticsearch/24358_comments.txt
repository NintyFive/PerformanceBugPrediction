Some of your index file are corrupt as is indicated by messages like `codec footer mismatch (file truncated?): actual footer=0 vs expected footer=-1071082520`.\r\n\r\nWe also reserve Github for bug reports and feature requests only. Please ask questions like these in the [Elasticsearch forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) instead.
