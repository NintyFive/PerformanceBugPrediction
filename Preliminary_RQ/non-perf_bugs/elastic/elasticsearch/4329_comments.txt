I wonder if you could do current request listing without something fancy - just keeping a list per node. But meh, just not being able to make bad queries is more likely I think.\n\nThe lack of a kill feature is still a big whole when you compare it to relational databases - they always have the feature and I've always used it. Its a bit wish list-y though. PostgreSQL's kill works because each connection has process isolation. It makes locking harder but killing easier. With Elasticsearch you'd have to do something like add `Thread.interrupted` all over the place or something.
