You need to increase your heap size (remembering that you should keep at least 50% of your available RAM for file system caches), increase the number of nodes you have or decrease your memory usage.\n\nHaving hundreds of indices on just two boxes uses a lot of resources, especially if you have just used the defaults of 5 primaries per index and most of your shards are pretty empty. Try creating indices with 1 primary shard instead.\n\nAlso, fielddata is a big user of memory, especially when applied to high cardinality string fields.  Clearing the caches won't help here as the fielddata just gets reloaded the next time you run a query which needs it.\n\nEssentially, it's time to scale... either vertically (more RAM) or horizontally (more nodes).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
