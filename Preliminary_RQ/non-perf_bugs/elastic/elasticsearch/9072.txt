Thus I want to implement this feature. I already had a look and it should be easy to implement it by implementing an Hdfs-Directory like in Solr (or even easier use the existing one, as it is simply an implementation of a `BaseDirectory`). As in Lucene 5's Directory APIs the file operations are kept isolated inside the `Directory` implementation it should not be a big problem adding this feature by implementing classes like in `org.elasticsearch.index.store.fs`.\n\nSo I also have a few questions: Is it possible to use Solr's implementation of `HdfsDirectory` (legally, technically,....) and why is this implemented in Solr, not in Lucene itself?\n\nAlso I would like to discuss in what way my contribution would be best implemented in order to be accepted into the project.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
