The handling is different there.  The BinaryFieldMapper still has \"YES\" for \"store\", but the  method loadDocument() in FetchPhase, when the binary \"blob\" field is in the FieldSelector, is indeed returning the binary data, which wasn't happening in 0.19.4.  So - binary field handling looks to have been changed somewhere in the versions post-0.19.4.
