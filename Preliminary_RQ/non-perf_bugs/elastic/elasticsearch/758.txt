The first set of settings include the `index.refresh_interval` and `index.merge.policy` settings. This combination of settings can come handy when doing bulk indexing, and then moving to a more real time indexing. For example, before doing bulk indexing, update the settings:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/_settings -d '{\n    \"index\" : {\n        \"refresh_interval\" : \"-1\",\n        \"merge.policy.merge_factor\" : 30\n    }\n}'\n```\n\nIn the above, we disable refreshing, and increase the merge factor to 30 to decrease the merge operations we will do. Once done, we can go back to normal:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/_settings -d '{\n    \"index\" : {\n        \"refresh_interval\" : \"1s\",\n        \"merge.policy.merge_factor\" : 10\n    }\n}'\n```\n\nBut, since we changed the merge factor, we probably also want to optimize down to 10 (or even 5):\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9200/test/_optimize?max_num_segments=5\n```\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
