Personally I'm a bit conflicted between logging this as INFO or DEBUG in general. However, for document level exceptions like version conflicts and doc already exists, we typically log a trace message as it can be very verbose and also not an error per-se but rather normal API behavior. I think we should follow that standard here too. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
