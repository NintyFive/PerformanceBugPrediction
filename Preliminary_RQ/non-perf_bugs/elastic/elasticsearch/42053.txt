For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /_security/api_key\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"my-api-key\",\r\n  \"role_descriptors\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be more favourable if this parameter could be `null` or omitted altogether and for the behaviour to still be the same as if an empty object declaration `{}` was provided. The .NET client default behaviour is to omit properties that are null (by default), having to specify an empty value requires workarounds\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/blob/41fdbb1532f5c1da49013383bc16ba4503d85d94/src/Nest/XPack/Security/ApiKey/CreateApiKey/CreateApiKeyRequest.cs#L37\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/blob/41fdbb1532f5c1da49013383bc16ba4503d85d94/src/Nest/XPack/Security/ApiKey/CreateApiKey/CreateApiKeyRequest.cs#L50\r\n\r\n- Interactions with the API require a user with the `superuser` role.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/blob/41fdbb1532f5c1da49013383bc16ba4503d85d94/src/Tests/Tests/XPack/Security/ApiKey/SecurityApiKeyTests.cs#L63\r\n\r\n# REST JSON specs\r\n\r\n- The specifications have dropped the `xpack.*` prefix in the filename and specification key name. Not an issue per se, but it is inconsistent with the other APIs in `6.7.0`\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bizybot","id":902768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjc2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/902768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot","html_url":"https://github.com/bizybot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bizybot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
