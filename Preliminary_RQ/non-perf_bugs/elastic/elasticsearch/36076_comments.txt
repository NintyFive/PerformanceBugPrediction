Support for zipping the files would not play well with the incremental nature of the snapshot/restore functionality, which works at the per segment file level. There are other reasons as well why we're not supporting direct backups to Glacier, see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12500#issuecomment-375013311. There are ways however to reduce the number of files (reducing the number of indices, force merging shards, ...).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
