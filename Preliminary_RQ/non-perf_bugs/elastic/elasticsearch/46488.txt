MultiSearchTemplateRequest is mapped via RequestConverters#multiSearchTemplate, this method is missing the line to add Params to the underlying Request, like in other methods: `request.addParameters(params.asMap());`\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Create a MultiSearchTemplateRequest add a request and use a stored script with simple terms aggregation.\r\n2. Use RestHighLevelClient#msearchTemplate(request, RequestOptions.DEFAULT) to get the response.","closed_by":{"login":"henningandersen","id":33268011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjY4MDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/33268011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen","html_url":"https://github.com/henningandersen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
