If the realtime option isn't specified then default depends on the api.\n\nThe get and multi get apis default is based on which has been defined in the `action.get.realtime` setting. The default of the `action.get.realtime` is `true`. But the term vector apis don't have a setting like this and the `realtime` option just default to `true`.\n\nI don't think this setting is actually used a lot and I like to remove it. The main reason for that this cleans up to code and simplifies it. Secondly the behaviour is now inconsistent between apis. Also for the `realtime` and similar options, I think being able to set on a per request level is enough, there no need to have a node level default.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
