Unfortunately, your logs don't tell where the error occured. The fact that a client node failed (as opposed to a data or master node) suggests that it might be because too many shards were queried at once. Can you check how many shards you were querying in total? If you have time-based data, maybe you can shrink old indices?\r\n\r\nI am closing this issue now since out-of-memory errors caused by too many queried shards is something that we are addressing in the upcoming 6.0 release. https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/23253","performed_via_github_app":null}]
