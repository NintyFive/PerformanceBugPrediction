At that point the Java code assumes that `normalize` process failed to start, but it _did_ actually start, just incredibly slowly.\r\n\r\nWhen the next set of quantiles is received the Java code will fire up a new `normalize` process, but because it's for the same job the named pipes will have exactly the same names as the named pipes for the first `normalize` process.  This then opens up the possibility of files existing unexpectedly and/or weird corruption as multiple processes share the same files.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid the possibility of duplicates by adding an extra number into the named pipe file names used by `normalize`.  This number can just be incremented each time the normalizer is called.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
