They currently use the TransportBroadcastOperationAction infrastructure.\n\nTransportBroadcastOperationAction is built to send request for one shard per replication group and send a request per shard it needs (and falls back  upon failure). The above API do not need this fall back mechanism and are commonly sent to many shards at once (for example, `GET _stats` goes to all shards of all indices). This results in an inefficiency where we may send hundreds of requests to a single node (one per every shard it holds). It will be more efficient to group those request per node and use the TransportNodesOperationAction model. \n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
