It made reproducing and understanding this bug incredibly easy, which enabled me to quickly fix the bug. üôè \r\n\r\nI analyzed the situation here and found that we have a bug in how a listener that is waiting for multiple callbacks to complete handles failures. In particular, if they all fail for the same reason (such as the same connect transport exception because they were all waiting for a connection to be established, which failed, which caused the multiple callbacks to receive the same instance of the exception), then we would attempt to self-suppress the exception, which is forbidden. This caused an exception to be thrown, which caused the listener waiting for the multiple callbacks to complete to never be invoked, which meant the client was never notified. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ\r\n\r\nI opened #53262 to address this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/596153062","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53174#issuecomment-596153062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53174","id":596153062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjE1MzA2Mg==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-08T00:46:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-08T00:46:16Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-distributed (:Distributed/CCR)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
