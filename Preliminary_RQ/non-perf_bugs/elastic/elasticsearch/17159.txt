Is _id available at the end of the query phase such that fetch would be redundant when all I want is the _id? Can this be done through the current API? \n\nUltimately, I'm hoping to retrieve doc IDs from a search much faster than what I've seen so far. I've tried all documented ways in all sorts of permutations to get better performance, and I've found no satisfactory results. The best I've achieved was only a 25% speed improvement by, in parallel, querying each of 5 shards individually. An acceptable speed would be 90% faster. It would help a lot to understand whether this is reasonable and why if it is not. It's very difficult to understand why I can be given a) the first 100 results, b) the total count and c) have them sorted so quickly, but retrieving the results is very slow. \n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
