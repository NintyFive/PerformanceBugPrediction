Currently there are a few options:\n- Decrease the refresh interval to < 1s (not recommended given that refresh is expensive and can affect indexing performance if set too low)\n- Make an explicit/immediate refresh call after the upload action\n- Delay the update of the view in the UI to allow the new docs to be refreshed in the index.\n\n@mikemccand noted that there is something called ControlledRealTimeReopenThread in Lucene that handles exactly this use case (but not currently exposed in ES), where most search requests don't have to see the latest change but then one specific search request does.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
