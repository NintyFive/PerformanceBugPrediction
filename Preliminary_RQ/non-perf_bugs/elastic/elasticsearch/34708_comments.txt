I just checked this on 6.4.3 and there still seems to be an issue. It took me a while to notice that the problem is connected to the presence of the `&` ampersand in the query string, without it you get results. Just to clarify:\r\n```\r\nDELETE /unmapped-field-test\r\n\r\nPUT /unmapped-field-test\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"doc\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"title\": { \"type\": \"text\" },\r\n        \"body\": { \"type\": \"text\" }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nPOST /unmapped-field-test/doc\r\n{\r\n  \"title\": \"risk\",\r\n  \"body\": \"impact analysis\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis one doesn't return the above doc:\r\n```\r\nPOST /unmapped-field-test/doc/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"simple_query_string\": {\r\n      \"query\": \"risk & impact analysis\",\r\n      \"fields\": [\"title\", \"title_en_us\", \"body\"],\r\n      \"default_operator\": \"AND\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhile this query does:\r\n```\r\nPOST /unmapped-field-test/doc/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"simple_query_string\": {\r\n      \"query\": \"risk impact analysis\",\r\n      \"fields\": [\"title\", \"title_en_us\", \"body\"],\r\n      \"default_operator\": \"AND\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are still `MatchNoDocsQuery`s in the explanation, but they are all inside other clauses that are or-ed together:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"explanation\": \"\"\"+(+(title:risk | body:risk | MatchNoDocsQuery(\"unmapped field [title_en_us]\"))~1.0 +(title:impact | body:impact | MatchNoDocsQuery(\"unmapped field [title_en_us]\"))~1.0 +(title:analysis | body:analysis | MatchNoDocsQuery(\"unmapped field [title_en_us]\"))~1.0) #*:*\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the example you mention contains a fourth, single MatchNoDocsQuery clause that most likely comes from the `&` dropped by the tokenizer for the other two fields but sticks around for the unmapped field. I will do some more digging.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/439532672","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34708#issuecomment-439532672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34708","id":439532672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTUzMjY3Mg==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-16T21:24:24Z","updated_at":"2018-11-16T21:24:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">     * the query contains a token (e.g. `&`) that is ignored by the standard analyzer\r\n\r\nSorry, I missed that part in the original description, you already stated that clearly.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/439796931","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34708#issuecomment-439796931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34708","id":439796931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTc5NjkzMQ==","user":{"login":"robinroestenburg","id":693266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzI2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/693266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinroestenburg","html_url":"https://github.com/robinroestenburg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinroestenburg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinroestenburg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinroestenburg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinroestenburg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinroestenburg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinroestenburg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinroestenburg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinroestenburg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinroestenburg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-19T07:32:46Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T07:32:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @cbuescher, thanks for taking a look at this one.
