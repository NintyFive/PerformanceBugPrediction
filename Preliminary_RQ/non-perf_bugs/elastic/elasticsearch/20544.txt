We have followed the workaround as suggested on [github #3114](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/3114), but when trying to start the kibana, we found the following error messages on kibana log:\n\n```\n{\"type\":\"log\",\"@timestamp\":\"2016-09-19T06:57:33Z\",\"tags\":[\"status\",\"plugin:xpack_main@5.0.0-alpha5-SNAPSHOT\",\"error\"],\"pid\":25694,\"state\":\"red\",\"message\":\"Status changed from yellow to red - Request Timeout after 30000ms\",\"prevState\":\"yellow\",\"prevMsg\":\"Waiting for Elasticsearch\"}\n{\"type\":\"log\",\"@timestamp\":\"2016-09-19T06:57:33Z\",\"tags\":[\"status\",\"plugin:graph@5.0.0-alpha5-SNAPSHOT\",\"error\"],\"pid\":25694,\"state\":\"red\",\"message\":\"Status changed from yellow to red - Request Timeout after 30000ms\",\"prevState\":\"yellow\",\"prevMsg\":\"Waiting for Elasticsearch\"}\n{\"type\":\"log\",\"@timestamp\":\"2016-09-19T06:57:33Z\",\"tags\":[\"status\",\"plugin:reporting@5.0.0-alpha5-SNAPSHOT\",\"error\"],\"pid\":25694,\"state\":\"red\",\"message\":\"Status changed from yellow to red - Request Timeout after 30000ms\",\"prevState\":\"yellow\",\"prevMsg\":\"Waiting for Elasticsearch\"}\n{\"type\":\"log\",\"@timestamp\":\"2016-09-19T06:57:33Z\",\"tags\":[\"status\",\"plugin:security@5.0.0-alpha5-SNAPSHOT\",\"error\"],\"pid\":25694,\"state\":\"red\",\"message\":\"Status changed from yellow to red - Request Timeout after 30000ms\",\"prevState\":\"yellow\",\"prevMsg\":\"Waiting for Elasticsearch\"}\n{\"type\":\"log\",\"@timestamp\":\"2016-09-19T06:57:43Z\",\"tags\":[\"error\",\"monitoring-ui\"],\"pid\":25694,\"level\":\"error\",\"message\":\"Request Timeout after 30000ms\",\"error\":{\"message\":\"Request Timeout after 30000ms\",\"name\":\"Error\",\"stack\":\"Error: Request Timeout after 30000ms\\n    at /usr/share/kibana/node_modules/elasticsearch/src/lib/transport.js:336:15\\n    at [object Object].<anonymous    (/usr/share/kibana/node_modules/elasticsearch/src/lib/transport.js:365:7)\\n    at Timer.listOnTimeout (timers.js:92:15)\"}}\n```\n\nLooking further on the ES log, I can see the following error messages which seems to indicate it tries to create those indices from the tribe node:\n\n```\n[2016-09-19 16:58:33,210][DEBUG][action.admin.indices.create] [dcmarhel6d] timed out while retrying [indices:admin/create] after failure (timeout [1m])\n[2016-09-19 16:58:33,210][DEBUG][action.admin.indices.create] [dcmarhel6d] timed out while retrying [indices:admin/create] after failure (timeout [1m])\n[2016-09-19 16:58:33,239][INFO ][xpack.security.audit.logfile] [transport] [access_granted] origin_type=[rest], origin_address=[127.0.0.1], principal=[dcma.appservice], action=[indices:data/write/bulk]\n[2016-09-19 16:58:33,239][INFO ][xpack.security.audit.logfile] [transport] [access_granted] origin_type=[rest], origin_address=[127.0.0.1], principal=[dcma.appservice], action=[indices:admin/create], indices=[_data]\n[2016-09-19 16:58:33,240][DEBUG][action.admin.indices.create] [dcmarhel6d] no known master node, scheduling a retry\n[2016-09-19 16:58:33,240][INFO ][xpack.security.audit.logfile] [transport] [access_granted] origin_type=[rest], origin_address=[127.0.0.1], principal=[dcma.appservice], action=[indices:admin/create], indices=[_xpack]\n[2016-09-19 16:58:33,240][DEBUG][action.admin.indices.create] [dcmarhel6d] no known master node, scheduling a retry\n```\n\nWe've tried to set the tribe node to be a data node to see if it will create the indices, but it didn't work although the kibana would start just fine. After reverting the data node to be a tribe node, we still found the same error messages.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Install kibana on tribe node\n2. Follow workaround as stated on github #3114 (pointing kibana to elected master node and create dashboard,search,visualization before repointing it back to tribe node)\n3. Check kibana.stdout and elasticsearch.log\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
