Resetting index settings only works for settings that have a default, but the analyzer section in the settings is entirely user defined and therefore cannot be reset easily. You can add new analyzers to existing ones like [described in the settings update API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-update-settings.html#update-settings-analysis) and you can even overwrite tokenizers and/or filters this way (this is dangerous though and should maybe considered a bug more than a feature, since it silently changes the way text fields are stored for an existing index). All these are merginge operations though, removing and entire analyzer isn't possible. \r\nI understand why this isn't ideal if you never used that analyzer on a field, but this should mostly happen in development situatiosn where re-creation of the entire index isn't a big problem. Just to confirm: is this mostly a cosmetic issue (cleaning up those erroneous old settings) or are you facing this problem in a real production situation where you really need this ability?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/554438176","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48877#issuecomment-554438176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48877","id":554438176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDQzODE3Ng==","user":{"login":"freesinger","id":20896930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODk2OTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/20896930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freesinger","html_url":"https://github.com/freesinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freesinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freesinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freesinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freesinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freesinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freesinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freesinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freesinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freesinger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-15T16:48:50Z","updated_at":"2019-11-15T16:48:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot @cbuescher , I am setting ES in develpment situation, so whether I am capaple to delete my custom analyzer or not does not matter too much.
