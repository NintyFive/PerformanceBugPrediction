There is a cyclic dependency issue when one of these classes is used in a plugin node service/component and this service/component is also used as a dependency in either a transport action or transport action filter. In this case were then unable to start the node and a big guice cyclic dependency error is printed.\n\nThe workaround is to provide `Client` or `ScriptService` via setter instead of constructor. This isn't ideal. I think there is just a mismatch on we think services/components depend on each other and how things are really wired up together with Guice. Specially the only Client in a node is `NodeClient` and that indirectly requires all services/components, but if another services is then having a dependency on `Client` things get tricky and it creates a dependency mess. I'm not sure how to fix this.\n\nIn certain cases the setter workaround doesn't suffice and in order to avoid cyclic dependencies a Guice `Provider` or directly using the Guice injector is used to fetch the `Client` or `ScriptService`. This is hack is just dirty and event worse then the setter workaround.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
