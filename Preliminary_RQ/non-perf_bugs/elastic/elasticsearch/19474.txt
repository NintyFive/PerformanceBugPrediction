This lets you make changes to the feature whilst still being able to test your changes quickly without having to reload whatever dataset each time.\n\nCurrently the `gradle run` command starts up a completely fresh cluster with a blank data directory which I think is absolutely the right default behaviour. However it would be good to have a option such as `--data /absolute/path/to/data/directory` which sets the data directory to your custom path.\n\nBonus points if you can also specify a custom `elasticsearch.yml` file to use so you can enable options like CORS etc. on the cluster.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
