I also was trying this route last night. the only downside is that it requires sending null as field value. it will not handle missing values. I know it is a bigger issue (setting default value for missing values) than this use case and it probably does not make awful lot of sense in context of general default value for missing but in this case it would be very convenient as it will allow 100% transparently without any change of data add a boolean multifield for presence of value providing much simpler queries/aggregations and most likely better performance comparing with missing filter/agg\n\nso I guess my question is would it make sense to consider support of default value for missing values the way it is done for nulls?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/128667433","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12679#issuecomment-128667433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12679","id":128667433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODY2NzQzMw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-07T10:22:56Z","updated_at":"2015-08-07T10:22:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@roytmana I don't think we should add yet another option for this.
