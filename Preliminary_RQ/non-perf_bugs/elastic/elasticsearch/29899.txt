This could unfortunately happen when the DNS query fails for some reason as getHostName will return the IP address and this will not match the `*.google.com` rule. Probably some DNS hiccup, but I'm opening this just to keep an eye on the test and if it doesn't fail again (as it hasn't had before ), it can be closed","closed_by":{"login":"jkakavas","id":10281256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgxMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10281256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas","html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
