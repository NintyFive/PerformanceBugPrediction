This file is sourced during the pre-install script of your RPM package. But: The script checks for a parameter called \"RESTART_ON_UPGRADE\" - the \"ES_\"-prefix is missing and the service won't be restarted during the upgrade process.\n\nWe tried copying the whole parameter in /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch, renamed it to \"RESTART_ON_UPGRADE\" and did a re-install via yum. This time our Elasticsearch node was restarted as expected.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Install Elasticsearch from repository using yum.\n2. Set ES_RESTART_ON_UPGRADE in /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch to true.\n3. Do a upgrade using using yum.\n4. See that Elasticsearch has not been restarted.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
