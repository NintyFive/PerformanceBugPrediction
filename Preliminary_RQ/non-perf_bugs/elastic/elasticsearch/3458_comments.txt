In that case you would get back the documents in the same order you have put the id in your request. Also, get and multi_get are a better fit when using elasticsearch as a storage as they are real-time, while search is only (Near) real-time, which means that a refresh needs to happen in order to make newly indexed documents searchable (a refresh happens automatically every second by default though).\n\nOtherwise, if you do need a query and want to use the search API, can't you just sort your documents by `_id`? The issue you may encounter there is that the [`_id` field](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-id-field.html) is not indexed by default, but you can change its mapping or use the [`_uid` field](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-uid-field.html) instead, which contains type+id and it is indexed by default, thus it can be used for sorting out of the box.\n\nLet me know if this helps and maybe next time (if you haven't done it yet) can you send a question to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/elasticsearch) just to double check that you tried all the options you have? \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/26591217","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3458#issuecomment-26591217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3458","id":26591217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTkxMjE3","user":{"login":"damienalexandre","id":225704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTcwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/225704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre","html_url":"https://github.com/damienalexandre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-18T12:19:37Z","updated_at":"2013-10-18T12:19:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank for the reply :)\n- Multi get api **can't run facets** or other ES Query powerful features - having the feature in the ID's query would allow a lot of possibilities.\n- Ordering by _id/_uid is not a solution, you can have non linear _id (like hashes from an url shortener...), and also I want my documents in the order I request them, it can be random.\n\nPS: Here is the related discussion in the ES ML: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/elasticsearch/QQ8RXyMD4fM/discussion\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/26592845","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3458#issuecomment-26592845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3458","id":26592845,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTkyODQ1","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-18T12:49:57Z","updated_at":"2013-10-18T12:49:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for your quick feeback, I see what you mean!\n\nI think a custom script is the way to go here, as it's really your own logic and not something really common.
