I am still wondering, if there is a problem for you with the current implementation. You can update, you can index (and delete etc..), and it works as expected from the user point of view. I do not fully understand which functionality you are missing compared to other data stores - which must be the reason for this issue. :-)\n\nIf nothing is missing at this point I'd rather close this issue, as the 'append only' design decision is not likely to be changed due to the underlying libraries being used.\n\nAnd yes, this design results in indexing/updating taking more time, but append only storage has several nice advantages like heavy use of file system caches (the mantra being 'query speed over indexing speed' here).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
