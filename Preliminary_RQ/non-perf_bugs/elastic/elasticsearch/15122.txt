I take snapshots to S3 daily.\n\nThe problem is that I can't start a 2.0.0 elasticsearch and use the snapshot to restore because it complains about \".\" character. I checked the fields with \".\" character using  curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_all/_mapping . I know about the logstash de-dot filter but this does not help me as it cannot go back and fix existing data.\n\nHow do I restore my snapshot? If the option is to delete the offending data then I'm ok with it. Could anyone let me know how?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
