Now it says this:\n\n```\nWhile there is no theoretical limit to the amount of data that a primary shard can hold, there is a practical limit. What constitutes the maximum shard size depends entirely on your use case: the hardware you have, the size and complexity of your documents, how you index and query your documents, and your expected response times.\n```\n\nSomethings I've found anecdotally that would be nice to have in there if they are true:\n- Having more total shards then nodes slows down queries quite a bit.\n- While most things parallelize reasonably well highlighting multi term queries and the term and phrase suggester have pretty high per shard costs.\n- If you have more then 500 indexes you should keep each index in fewer shards to keep the cluster state smaller.\n- Shards bigger then a few gigabytes take a long time to copy.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
