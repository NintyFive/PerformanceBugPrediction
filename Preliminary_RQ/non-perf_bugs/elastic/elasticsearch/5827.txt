I am using fake data which should give me very low numbers for the cardinality but it actually seems to be counting the number of rows not the number of distinct items. The numbers are outrageously high.\n\nI tried a precision threshold of 1000 and 100 but it seems to make no difference.\n","closed_by":{"login":"timuckun","id":101559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/101559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timuckun","html_url":"https://github.com/timuckun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timuckun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timuckun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timuckun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timuckun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timuckun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timuckun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timuckun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timuckun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timuckun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
