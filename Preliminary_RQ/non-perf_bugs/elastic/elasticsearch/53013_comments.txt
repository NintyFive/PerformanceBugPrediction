We have as a team settled on `200 OK` for bulk requests successfully processed by the coordinating node, even if some or all of the individual items do not succeed (see e.g. https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28522#issuecomment-363212730 and https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29169#issuecomment-374781738). We recognise  that this means that clients cannot use the status code of the overall response to react appropriately to failures of bulk requests, but there are too many cases where a different status code would also result in the wrong reaction. Choosing the \"worst possible\" code doesn't really work, even where it is well-defined. It turns out to be simpler for all concerned if we uniformly ask clients always to look at the status of each item in a bulk response as we do today.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
