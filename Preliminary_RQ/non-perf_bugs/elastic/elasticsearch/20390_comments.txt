If someone can guide me how to replace that with Tika 1.14 in a build (I don't have much experience with java and its build systems), then I can certainly try to re-test against my body of documents.  I can see from [here](https://github.com/apache/tika/releases), that the latest release is still showing 1.13 ... and that 1.14 is technically still [unreleased](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel).  Is 1.14 expected to be formally released anytime soon, so that if it does fix this problem that it could get rolled into one the 5.0 beta
