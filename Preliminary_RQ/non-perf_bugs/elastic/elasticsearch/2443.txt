I was watching the talk at Berlin buzz words by Shay Banon, and he was speaking about adding routing to a document so it will always end up on the same shard, there a single user wont need an index just for themselves. Now lets say I want to have a rule that every 1000 users I create a new shard, this way I get a new blank shard that i can start putting data into. and there is no migration required. If you want to think about the uses for something about this lets look at game design, when a user starts we are going to need there profile data maybe a log of the things they have done, if I am easily able to add more shards and when I need to add more machines to move the shards to that makes it easy and if the game gets less popular i can just remove nodes and scale donwn.\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
