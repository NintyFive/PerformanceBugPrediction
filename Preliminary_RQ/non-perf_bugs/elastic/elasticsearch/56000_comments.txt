When displaying a list of processors within a pipeline visually, it's more difficult to determine which processor is responsible for which changes without the presence of a processor description. [Here is an example](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-team-planning/issues/65#issuecomment-628688441) mockup that highlights where these descriptions would be used in order to make it easier for users to quickly see information about the processor beyond the processor name and identify the specific processor they intend to edit/delete/etc. \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
