Our logging configuration now is just a thin wrapper around log4j so we'd have to reimplement it if we wanted continuity. I think we're better off telling users \"the logging configuration is log4j 2.x\" or \"the logging configuration is jdk built in\" and then telling them about the 6 or 8 interesting loggers. Then they can use the massive wealth of knowledge on the internet about configuring logging in those environments.
