A quick peek at the link you provided shows, that there is a typo near `search_type=count` at one query, as the ampersand is escaped. Maybe that is the issue.\n\nIf it is not, can you please provide a complete gist for us to reproduce with curl commands (index creation, document indexing and queries), so we can see, where the problems are?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/19904495","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3127#issuecomment-19904495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3127","id":19904495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTA0NDk1","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-24T12:46:07Z","updated_at":"2013-06-24T12:46:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing.
