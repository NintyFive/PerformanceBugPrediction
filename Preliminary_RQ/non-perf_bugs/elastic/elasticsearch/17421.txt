However, the semantics are different and doesn't provide the same functionality as the 2.x implementation.\n\nIn 2.x a plugin would register a listener directly with an IndexShard after creation.  I have a 2.x plugin that uses information about the IndexShard when handling events in the listener.\n\nIn the new implementation, there is a single instance of a given listener used for all IndexShards for an Index.  I don't see a way to get the calling IndexShard in the listener anymore.\n\nWas this an intentional change, or can we get this functionality back in?\nI can provide a PR...\nIf you would like a PR for this, I see two ways to solve.  Register a listener factory in IndexModule, build and attach the listeners just after IndexShard creation.  Or pass the calling IndexShard to the listener on each event call.\n","closed_by":{"login":"oillio","id":205051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTA1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/205051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oillio","html_url":"https://github.com/oillio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oillio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oillio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oillio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oillio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oillio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oillio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oillio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oillio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oillio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
