Running a `query_string` on `nested.foo_alias2` (`\"query_string\": {\"query\": \"nested.foo_alias2: xyz\"}`) seems to indicate that `nested` -> `foo_alias2` definition won.\r\n- `_field_caps` doesn't return a `nested` field of type `object`, only `nested.foo_alias2` is returned. This spawns two additional questions:\r\n    - are `.` dots allowed in fields definitions for alias type of fields? If they are, shouldn't have the same behavior as a normal dotted field definition?\r\n\r\ncc @jtibshirani ","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
