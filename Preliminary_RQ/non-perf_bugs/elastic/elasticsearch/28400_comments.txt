I'm not sure you meant that something in the UI (Kibana) should change or something in Elasticsearch. I suggest you open an issue on our forums at http://discuss.elastic.co under the project that you feel is most relevant and then we can figure out what should go on github and where. I'm going close this now. We can always reopen if needed.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
