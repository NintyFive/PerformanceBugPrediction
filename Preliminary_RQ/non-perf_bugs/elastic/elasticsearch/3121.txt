Unfortunately I don't have a fully reproducible case; this seems to have happened in two cases, (1) a node fails and leaves/re-enters the cluster (2) a percolator shard goes in to a 'recovering' state.\n\nHere's an example of what we see:\n\n```\n~$ curl -XGET 'node1.endpoint:9200/abc/def/_percolate' -d '{\"doc\":{\"foo\":\"bar\"}}'\n{\"ok\":true,\"matches\":[\"some-result\"]}\n~$ curl -XGET 'node2.endpoint:9200/abc/def/_percolate' -d '{\"doc\":{\"foo\":\"bar\"}}'\n{\"ok\":true,\"matches\":[]}\n```\n\nFurthermore, we'll see for the \"docs\" entry in the below calls:\n\n```\n~$ curl -XGET endpoint.node1:9200/_percolator/_status\n\"docs\" : { \"num_docs\" : 8, \"max_doc\" : 8, \"deleted_docs\" : 0 }\n~$ curl -XGET endpoint.node2:9200/_percolator/_status\n\"docs\" : { \"num_docs\" : 8, \"max_doc\" : 11, \"deleted_docs\" : 3 }\n```\n\nSome notes on the occurrence: \n- We're running 5 nodes, and we will see \"matches\": [] across some number of them (2 during the most recent event).\n- The results returned from each node are consistent, meaning that we will receive empty matches repeatedly from the same bad node.\n- Flushing or refreshing do not resolve this.\n- The appropriate documents exist on disk in the machines (maybe expected):\n  `/location/elasticsearch/nodes/0/indices/_percolator/0/index/_0.fdt`\n  contained the same document on both machines.\n\nResolution:\nThe only way we can resolve this at the moment is by deleting the _percolator index and re-submitting entries to it.\n\nThis is running on Ubuntu with java version 1.6.0_27. We have 5 nodes, 3 indices.
