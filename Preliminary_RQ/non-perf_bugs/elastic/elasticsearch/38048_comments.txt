I tried you recreation with Elasticsearch 6.7 and it works as expected. A query with fuzziness AUTO for `inyer` returns the document that contains `interpretation`. Also note that the expansion is limited to the 50 closest terms so if you have a lot of documents and since you use edge_ngrams on this field it is likely possible that the selected terms do not include `inter` in the final query. I am going to close this issue but feel free to reopen if you can find a simple reproduction that exhibits the issue on Elasticsearch 6.7.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
