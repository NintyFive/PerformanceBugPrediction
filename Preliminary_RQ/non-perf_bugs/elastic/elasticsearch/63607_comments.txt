You're right in that this seems to have no effect on closed indices.\r\n\r\nFor the get index alias API, I believe the `ignore_unavailable` parameter targets the optional `<index>` request parameter. Requests that include a missing index in the `<index>` argument still return an error if `ignore_unavailable=false`. I'll update the docs to make this clearer.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
