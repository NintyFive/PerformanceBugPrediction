Nothing has changed regarding the handling of scroll context between 7.3 and 7.5. We fixed a [race condition](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/53449) with the counting of scroll contexts but that was released in `7.6.2`. Note that the number of documents in the index doesn't make a difference here, we always count each shard in the scroll context as an increment of 1. \r\nI advise you to look at the number of open contexts per node and to check that you delete the scroll when it is exhausted. \r\nI am closing this issue because we reserve github for verified bugs and feature requests. If you still see the problem please open a discussion in the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elastic-stack/elasticsearch/6) where it will be easier to diagnose.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
