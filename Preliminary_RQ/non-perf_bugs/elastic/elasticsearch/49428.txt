version:** v7.3.1\r\n**OS version:** Linux 4.4.0-1098-aws\r\n**JVM**: OpenJDK 1.8.0_201 / 25.201-b09\r\n\r\n**Current behaviour:**\r\n\r\nIf I execute a search with an invalid JSON request body, e.g. missing a double-quote:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET blogs/_search\r\n{\"query\":{\"match\":{\"title\":{\"query\":\"open source software,\"minimum_should_match\":2}}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen ES rejects the query with a 500, which indicates a server-side problem.\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour:**\r\n\r\nThe server should respond with \"400 Bad Request\", to indicate a client problem.\r\n\r\n**Impact:**\r\n\r\nThe 500 is problematic because it indicates to clients that they can retry the request, but of course it will always fail.
