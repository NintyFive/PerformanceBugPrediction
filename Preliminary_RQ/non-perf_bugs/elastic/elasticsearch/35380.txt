Yes, I know this is not an officially supported port, however the workaround proposed here is an extension of what is already being done to Logstash and will not break anyone else: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/keystore.html\r\n\r\nFor some reason \"LOGSTASH_KEYSTORE_PASS\" is not an option for ELASTIC, which results in the following error:\r\n**Error deriving PBKDF2 keys.**\r\n\r\nIssue being that the keystore password is empty.\r\n\r\nThis was briefly discussed here, however, no present workaround exists: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32146\r\n\r\nIf you guys have other ideas - please post. We're able to run OpenJDK on Z-linux, however, the performance of that is unacceptable due to lack of native bindings. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
