When we randomly create test filters, we allow creating filters with super low capacity/precision.  This means that no matter what you add to the filters it's pretty much guaranteed to create internal collisions after a handful of values, which means all filters converge to equality quickly.\r\n\r\nWill push a fix with some larger defaults, and some better logging in case this happens again.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/529490079","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46443#issuecomment-529490079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46443","id":529490079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTQ5MDA3OQ==","user":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-09T14:03:00Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T14:03:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @polyfractal !","performed_via_github_app":null}]
