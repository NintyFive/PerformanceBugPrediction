Unfortunately this doesn't work by default because the elasticsearch init script tries to autodetect `JAVA_HOME` and use that instead of the java in the path: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/544ef8cb17014efb72abb2932d227e4f327b1dcb/src/deb/init.d/elasticsearch#L47\n\nWe can override the detected `JAVA_HOME`  in `/etc/default/elasticsearch`, causing the script to fall back to `which java` as desired. Before committing to this approach, we'd like to confirm that this behavior won't accidentally or intentionally change without warning in the future. Can we count on an empty `JAVA_HOME` being respected in future versions?\n\nI'd also like to suggest removing the code that autodetects `JAVA_HOME`, especially for distributions that use update-alternatives. I prefer the behavior of the default elasticsearch binaries: use `JAVA_HOME` if present but don't try to set it.\n\n/cc @spinscale\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
