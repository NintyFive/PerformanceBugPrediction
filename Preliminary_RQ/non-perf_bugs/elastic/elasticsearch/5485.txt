It allows to create buckets and metrics based on the parent docs in the buckets of child documents.\n\nThis aggregation only makes sense inside a `nested` aggregator. Assume a ticket system with where the comments are embedded into the issue document. The `reverse_nested` aggregator would look like this:\n\n``` json\n\"aggs\" : {\n   \"top_commenters_to_issues\" : {\n        \"nested\" : {\"path\" : \"comments\"},\n        \"aggs\" : {\n            \"top_commenters\" : {\n                \"terms\" : { \"field\" : \"username\" },\n                \"aggs\" : {\n                    \"top_tags_to_comments\" : {\n                        \"reverse_nested\" : {\n                            \"path\" : \"comments\"\n                        },\n                        \"aggs\" : {\n                            \"top_tags\" : { \"terms\" : { \"field\" :  \"tags\"}}\n                        }    \n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis aggregation would return top username buckets and per username bucket the top tags. The important constraint that the `nested` and `reverse_nested` add here is that only tag buckets are associated to username buckets that reside in the nested structure.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
