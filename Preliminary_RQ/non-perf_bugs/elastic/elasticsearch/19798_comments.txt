I'd probably also wait for pipeline aggs to be exposed in Kibana since that would be a very good test of the usability of pipeline aggs, but this is something I hope we'll be able to do soon.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't like exposing options about internals like the terms agg execution hint or percentiles implementation. In the case of percentiles, I am wondering whether we could replace the option with something that characterizes the data or the expected accuracy without being implementation specific and would allow us to pick an impl internally.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/237806441","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19798#issuecomment-237806441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19798","id":237806441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzgwNjQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T09:33:05Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T09:33:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Discussed
