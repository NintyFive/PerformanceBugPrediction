I want to be able to search and highlight on this field without getting hits on html.  I added the \"html_strip\" char filter on my index and that effectively removes the hits on html markup.  However when it comes to highlighting the results I get a result similar to this:\r\n```\r\n\"htmlMarkup\": \"<span><span>test123</span></span>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI search on the term: \r\n`\"test123\"`\r\n\r\nmy highlight result:\r\n\r\n` \"<highlight>test123</span></span></highlight>`\r\n\r\n\r\nI would expect when highlighting on the search term \"test123\" that I would get a result like this:\r\n`<highlight>test123</highlight>`\r\n\r\nWhen I add a blank space after \"test123\" ie: \r\n\r\n`<span><span>test123 </span></span>`\r\n\r\nthe result i get is correct: \r\n`\r\n<highlight>test123 </highlight>`\r\n\r\nIf I do not use the  \"html_strip\" char filter than the highlight works correctly and as expected however, then I am able to search on \"span\" and get hits on the html markup itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Query on term that is within html markup on an field with \"html_strip\" char filter, the field must contain no space after term before closing html markup tags end\r\n 2. Notice that the highlight includes the closing html tags\r\n 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
