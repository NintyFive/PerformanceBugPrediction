I think there are two changes here that are causing the differences in the explain output, one that affects which results are returned, and another that shouldn't be relevant:\r\n- In 6.0 there was a breaking change to make `query_string` queries no longer split on whitespace as if it were an operator (#25470). So to produce the same behavior as before, an `OR` operator needs to be explicitly provided: `\"_exists_:(foo OR bar)\"`. It’s worth noting that we ended up re-introducing the ability to split keyword fields on whitespace, as this was a useful option (#30691).\r\n- As you mentioned, since 6.1 we default to using doc values for `exists` queries when they're available (#26930). I don’t think this should affect the semantics of `exists` queries at all.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps explain why the difference is occurring. It would be useful to know: did you raise this issue because it could have potentially been a bug, or do you have a use case where the new behavior is hurting usability?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/413807535","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31297#issuecomment-413807535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31297","id":413807535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzgwNzUzNQ==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-17T09:15:39Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T09:15:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ping @bczifra can you answer the question above?
