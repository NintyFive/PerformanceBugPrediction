How often do you really want to do `DELETE -test-*`  and doing a `+test*` is not needed, because it's inherently \"+\".  You would just do `DELETE test*`\n\nI would offer that because the implications of someone misunderstanding and and its questionable need, perhaps you should consider putting it in a query string option, then it's easier that it's more intentional.  eg to do the command that would now be `DELETE -test-*`, instead do a `DELETE *?exclude=test-*`.  Then it's much more obvious what you're doing but you still have the same power.  \n\nThe truth is that this is really mainly a problem with DELETE, perhaps these changes should just be made here.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/238508094","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19800#issuecomment-238508094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19800","id":238508094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODUwODA5NA==","user":{"login":"yehosef","id":149253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTI1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/149253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef","html_url":"https://github.com/yehosef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-09T09:57:18Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T09:57:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"note - some of this discussion is still relevant even if you remove dashes from the start of queries.
