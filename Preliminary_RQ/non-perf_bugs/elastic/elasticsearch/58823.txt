In general, the default for this value is `null`, meaning\r\n`don't do anything`, but we do not allow `null` to be set explicitly as this value.\r\n\r\nWhen we serialize a field mapper, we allow users to ask for the default values to be emitted even if they\r\nhave not been set.  For `null_values`, this yields a quandary: if we emit the value `null`, then the serialized\r\nmapping cannot be used in a subsequent put mapping request, because `null` is not accepted as a\r\nvalid value; but if we don't emit anything, then it looks as though we're missing a field even though the\r\nuser has asked for all configuration values.  #57666 added tests to check serialization and deserialization,\r\nand stopped null values being emitted, but it's not clear what the right choice is.","closed_by":{"login":"romseygeek","id":1347065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDcwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1347065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek","html_url":"https://github.com/romseygeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
