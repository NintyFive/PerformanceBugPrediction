@jordansissel, which version of elasticsearch were you using? A similar problem (for the NullPointerException you get) was fixed in 0.19.10.\n\nRegarding the high CPU problem, a new API was added to elasticsearch called hot threads, can you issue it if you see high CPU? Its: `curl localhost:9200/hot_threads`. Though I know that HTTP was problematic, maybe if you hit another node in the cluster, it will be able to execute it on the relevant node using the internal 9300 port.\n\nAlso, regarding the Java version, its `1.7.0_03`. I know netty has some problems with \"earlier\" 1.7 releases (because of some NIO bugs), can you try and use a later version?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/20057094","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2430#issuecomment-20057094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2430","id":20057094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDU3MDk0","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-26T15:42:37Z","updated_at":"2013-06-26T15:42:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Stale.
