Everything worked fine until the very last query using the \"minimum_should_match\" to filter out in-appropriate hits.\nIn this example the hit-list still contained \"Milit√§rgeschichte\", which should not be the case for a \"minimum_should_match\" of 80%. Only \"Weltgesundheitsorganisation\" should have been returned.\n\nI executed the example in java, see [java-version](https://github.com/sikron/elasticsearch-examples/blob/master/pocs/ngram/src/test/java/com/skronawi/elasticsearch/examples/poc/ngram/NgramMinShouldMatchScenario.java).
