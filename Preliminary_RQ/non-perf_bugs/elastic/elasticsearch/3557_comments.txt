However for OSGi tools we have it is not so obvious, so we need to mark package org.elasticsearch.common.joda.convert as optional all the time when we try to use elasticsearch.\n\nThe benefit of not shading org.joda.convert will be that all who wants to use joda-convert will be able to use it together with elasticsearch. Currently shaded joda time objects will be unknown for joda-convert since annotation names are not org.joda.convert.ToString but org.elasticsearch.common.joda.convert.ToString. This package does not exist, annotation will be dropped. Code below will not work differently for each instance:\n\n``` java\norg.joda.convert.StringConvert.convertToString(org.elasticsearch.common.joda.time.DateTime.now());\norg.joda.convert.StringConvert.convertToString(org.joda.time.DateTime.now());\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/38875811","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3557#issuecomment-38875811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3557","id":38875811,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODc1ODEx","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-28T00:00:01Z","updated_at":"2014-03-28T00:00:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"coming back to this, we added Joda convert because of this issue #4660, a bit of conflicting requirements....\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/51607999","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3557#issuecomment-51607999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3557","id":51607999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjA3OTk5","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T14:19:33Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T14:19:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"See PR #3558 \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
