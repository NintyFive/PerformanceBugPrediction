The scripts here are just different ways to build an object that self reference itself. And such objects will cause a recursive endless loop in XContentBuilder that terminates in a StackOverflowError if there's no mechanism to avoid it. We don't really catch an exception in #20550, we just prevent to iterate over and over the same object. Sadly it has a cost: keeping references to objects until the XContent is fully built. \n\nFor this issue maybe we could prevent scripts to build such objects (not sure how feasible it is) and/or use something like #20550 for all built object or maybe just objects that are produced or modified by scripts.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/248249159","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20540#issuecomment-248249159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20540","id":248249159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODI0OTE1OQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T09:21:15Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T09:21:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Unfortunately, #20550 seems to have problems - it causes (at least) script errors to be swallowed.
