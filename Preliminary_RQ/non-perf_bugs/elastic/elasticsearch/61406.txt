The value on mips is 65536, but on x86/arm is -1.`\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n I found the reason, in the elasticsearch/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/bootstrap/JNACLibrary.java, RLIMIT_AS is set to 5 when elasticsearch run on MAC_OS_X, otherwise RLIMIT_AS is set to 9. RLIMIT_AS is the system marco definition in resource.h. In resource.h of mips, the RLIMIT_AS is 6, but on x86/arm, the RLIMIT_AS is set to 9. In elasticsearch/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/bootstrap/JNACLibrary.java, we don't have to consider the characteristics of the mips platform. In other words, the default value of RLIMIT_AS has been modify on mips, on x86/mips, RLIMIT_AS is run by default. \r\nso, how should we fix this problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
