It returns the normal 'ok' response but the version number returned is the latest index version.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is; I am writing a very thin wrapper to elasticsearch, and any request into the wrapper after elasticsearch is put onto a messagequeue, if putting on that queue fails I return a specific 'temporary' error and the client is supposed to resend the request. When they resend the request, I didn't want it to fail at elasticsearch, hence this version type of external_quiet....\n\nhere is a pull request for my solution to this problem:- https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/1464\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
