Referring to issue #9726 where in @clintongormley mentioned that if one of the shard takes a longer time to respond, the search context gets expired on other shards which results in this exception. The reason for slower shard could be gc running on that particular node.\n\nwe are talking about 5 minutes here I don't think this is what's happening here....\n\n> The master node printed this exception for 15-20 times and after that logs vanished. Somewhere nearly 12 hours the master got shut down with other nodes in the cluster reporting error \"reason: zen-disco-master_failed\".\n\ndoes the exception happen when the node is shutting down?

My Java client asks for lot of documents from a single query. And this query is fired after approximately 10 seconds each with different parameters. All I can see in my logs are these exceptions for different ID's that ES is trying to locate at the very same instance of time.\nFor the other questions of yours\ndoes the exception happen when the node is shutting down?\nThe exception does not happen at the time of node shut down. In fact, there are actually no logs registered on the node which is getting shut down at the time of shutting down. Other nodes just mention that a node has been removed from cluster.\n\nWhy is your node shutting down at all? \nThat is what a million dollar question for us why ES process running on the node gets itself killed when nothing is reported.\n\nWhich version are you using?\n1.3.2\n you using the shutdown API anywhere? Is it possible that you are shutting down the cluster via the _shutdown API due to some developer using it locally?\nNo, we are not using shutdown API anywhere using the java API. It's a production instance where in we have blocked all these API through sense so no case of some developer shutting it down via _shutdown API. And always it's a random node which gets shutdown and not a specific node.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/151779024","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14330#issuecomment-151779024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14330","id":151779024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTc3OTAyNA==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-28T09:29:02Z","updated_at":"2015-10-28T09:29:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Which version are you using?\n> 1.3.2\n\nI strongly recommend to upgrade there are millions of bugs fixed since they.
