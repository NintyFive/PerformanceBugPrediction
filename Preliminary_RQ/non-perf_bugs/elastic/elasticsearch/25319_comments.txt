Seems like in 5.x the geohash_cell query can only be executed against previously existing indices, but not against old indices. That is why it is still available in the java api, also why we removed it in 6.x.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that we did miss to list this change among the breaking changes, and we should have deprecated these queries too before removing them which I am not sure we did.\r\n\r\n@nknize can you comment further on what the alternatives are please?\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/375756494","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25319#issuecomment-375756494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25319","id":375756494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTc1NjQ5NA==","user":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-23T18:17:10Z","updated_at":"2018-03-23T18:17:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"geoHashCellQuery was removed in 6.0.
