As discussed in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43453 and implemented in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/48351, this feature is deprecated now and set to be removed entirely in the next major version of Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nI understand that adaptive replica selection _should_ mostly replace this behavior, but due to cross-zone traffic costs and consistency, I would still strongly prefer a shard allocation aware routing if available. \r\n\r\nIf possible, I'd be happy with an \"opt-in\" option that still be available in the next major version of Elasticsearch for searches to be routed based on shard allocation awareness. Another idea would to have more influence on the adaptive replica selection algorithm, to be able to \"weight\" shard allocation awareness within that logic.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
