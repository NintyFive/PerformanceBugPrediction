Instead, the maximum number of documents to be retrieved should be specified for all the current metrics in the \"metric\" section using the \"k\" parameter (named so because Precision is usually calculated for a window size k, so its named \"Precicsion at k\" (Prec@k). \r\n\r\nThe window size should be specified in the metric because this way we can make sure that different queries don't use different \"size\" values to make the results comparable. I just realized this isn't mentioned in the documentation so far, so thanks for pointing this out. I will add proper usage examples for the \"k\" parameter to the docs.\r\n\r\nFor now, you can use e.g. \r\n```\r\n\"metric\": {\r\n    \"mean_reciprocal_rank\": {\r\n      \"k\" : 20\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a result window of 20.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/375340623","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29205#issuecomment-375340623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29205","id":375340623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTM0MDYyMw==","user":{"login":"paweloque","id":1042717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1042717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paweloque","html_url":"https://github.com/paweloque","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paweloque/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paweloque/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paweloque/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paweloque/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paweloque/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paweloque/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paweloque/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paweloque/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paweloque/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-22T15:08:36Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T15:08:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cbuescher Thanks for your reply and helping me!
