The reason that this is due to #24723 is because `/{index}/_alias` use to be specially handled by the get indices API but now it's handed by the get aliases API on the endpoint `/{index}/_alias/{name}` (so with these requests `name` would default to empty which acts like `_all`).\r\n\r\nIt's not obvious what the right outcome here is. We had the two endpoints before:\r\n - `/{index}/_alias`\r\n - `/{index}/_alias/{name}`\r\n\r\nIt really should have been the case that the former was always handled by the latter. Their behaviors were inconsistent which is why changing the former to be handled by the latter has this outcome. That is, on 5.4.1 today you can see the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n21:28:56 [jason:~] $ curl -XGET localhost:9200/logstash-0/_alias?pretty=true\r\n{\r\n  \"logstash-0\" : {\r\n    \"aliases\" : { }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n21:33:39 [jason:~] $ curl -XGET localhost:9200/logstash-0/_alias/_all?pretty=true\r\n{ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tend to think the latter behavior is the one that we should maintain as that's how *all* other alias requests were handled except for ones that did not specify any alias name. What is the need for the empty list of aliases if none exist for an index when this can also be inferred from no key matching the index being in the response?
