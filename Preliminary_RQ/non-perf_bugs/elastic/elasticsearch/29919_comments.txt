discussed in the @elastic/es-security team meeting and agree that it's not a good idea to do this (by default) in the `_authenticate` API as it is used for a range of purposes and shouldn't be considered to be a \"login\" interface.\r\n\r\n@skearns64 / @joshbressers Is this still a problem we want to solve?\r\nIf so, it seems like we'd want some way for Kibana to call \"authenticate this user and but don't use the cache\" when first validating the password.\r\nIt may be that we want to solve that alongside other questions about how Kibana manages \"login\" (like tracking failed passwords, etc) and drive it from a Kibana issue.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/410724838","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29919#issuecomment-410724838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29919","id":410724838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDcyNDgzOA==","user":{"login":"joshbressers","id":1692786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTI3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1692786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbressers","html_url":"https://github.com/joshbressers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbressers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbressers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbressers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbressers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbressers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbressers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbressers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbressers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbressers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-06T14:21:35Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T14:21:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
