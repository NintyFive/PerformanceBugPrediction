reading the [rolling upgrade process](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html#rolling-upgrades), you can see that we wrote:\n- disable allocation\n- upgrade node1\n- upgrade node2\n- upgrade node3\n- ...\n- enable allocation\n\nThat won't work as after a node has been removed and restarted, no shard will be allocated anymore.\nSo closing node2 and remaining nodes, won't help to serve index and search request anymore.\n\nWe should write:\n- disable allocation\n- upgrade node1\n- enable allocation\n- wait for shards being recovered on node1\n- disable allocation\n- upgrade node2\n- enable allocation\n- wait for shards being recovered on node2\n- disable allocation\n- upgrade node3\n- enable allocation\n- wait for shards being recovered on node3\n- disable allocation\n- ...\n- enable allocation\n\nI think this documentation update should go in 1.3, 1.4, 1.x and master branches.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
