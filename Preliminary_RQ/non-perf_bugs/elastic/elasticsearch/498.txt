Time limited search comes to the rescue in returning whatever results it has at the moment along with a flag indicating it was incomplete (debug info can say which shards fail to return in time).  So instead of 2,492,222 results you might end up with 2,300,190 but your app survives to query another day.\n\nLucene has a time limited hit collector for this purpose, so its ready to go!  (its there since at least 2.4 http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/api/org/apache/lucene/search/TimeLimitedCollector.html)\n\nIt can be configured at the index level for a default, and overridden in a specific query (i.e. allow more time for a more complicated query).\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
