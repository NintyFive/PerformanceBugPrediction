The parameter [is always sent](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v7.0.0-beta1/x-pack/plugin/watcher/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/watcher/support/search/WatcherSearchTemplateRequest.java#L317) irregardless if it is defined inside the search template (defaulted to true). So in 7.x a user can explicitly set it to false it per watch, but if they do nothing it will always be sent with a `true` value.  \r\n\r\nThis means that both `6.7` and `7.0` monitoring will always use the scalar value irregardless of where the watch originated. #38387 will change this behavior before 8.0.\r\n\r\nAlso, tested locally and 6.7 data -> 7.0 monitoring cluster with alerts works (lots of deprecation notices...but that is expected)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
