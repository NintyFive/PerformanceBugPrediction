For highlighting and suggestions there are only methods to retrieve the current builder and use it to customize the query.\n\nThe clojure client Elastisch relies on the methods that accept Maps. That is why there doesn't seem to be support for highlighting and suggestions using the native client in Elastisch, only for the REST API.\n\nBesides the problem with the clojure client I also think it would be nice to have a consistent interface.\n\nRelated issue in Elastisch:\nhttps://github.com/clojurewerkz/elastisch/issues/82\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
