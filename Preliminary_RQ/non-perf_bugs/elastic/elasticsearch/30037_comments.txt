Client side filtering can be problematic, because you may end up filtering out all or most of the items that come back from a graph API call, even if there are other valid results that _could_ have been returned. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/384137204","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30037#issuecomment-384137204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30037","id":384137204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDEzNzIwNA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-10T18:09:20Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T02:00:39Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"*Original comment by @uboness:*\n\nI tend to agree with @skearns64, @markharwood can't we simply extend the filtering support in terms/sig.terms on ES side?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/384137206","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30037#issuecomment-384137206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30037","id":384137206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDEzNzIwNg==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-10T18:09:20Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T02:00:39Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"*Original comment by @clintongormley:*\n\nA list of strings can always be converted to a regex if required - would be good for ES to do this automatically.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/667249268","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30037#issuecomment-667249268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30037","id":667249268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzI0OTI2OA==","user":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T17:43:43Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T17:43:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm going to close this.
