Until we decided to install Marvel :neckbeard: \n\nMarvel is fine, but we restarded the cluster to start the agent... our 70+ shards were not able to start anymore! IllegalArgumentException on all shards, about this field not mapped properly.\n\nI had to close all the indexes, no more logs history :sob: and since 2.0 removed the possibility to delete a Type, no possibility to clean up those bad indexes, I'm stuck with gigabyte of data I can't use because shard won't boot. Anyway.\n\nGlad this is now fixed, and waiting for ES 2.3.2 :neckbeard: :sparkling_heart: \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/235253505","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17567#issuecomment-235253505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17567","id":235253505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTI1MzUwNQ==","user":{"login":"cherweg","id":1556297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTYyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1556297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherweg","html_url":"https://github.com/cherweg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherweg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherweg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherweg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherweg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherweg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherweg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherweg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherweg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cherweg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-26T12:32:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T12:32:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is there any way to recovery the data of an specific type inside of such an index?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
