I want to receive those data, when searching for battles. But I can do it only when I search for tanks:\n\n``` javascript\nGET test/tank/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"nation\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"field\": \"nation\"\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"battles_count\": {\n          \"children\": {\n            \"type\": \"battle\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlthough, I can make such a monster:\n\n``` javascript\nGET replays/battle/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"usa\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"has_parent\": {\n          \"parent_type\": \"tank\",\n          \"query\": {\n            \"term\": {\n              \"nation\": \"usa\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"count\": {\n          \"value_count\": {\n            \"field\": \"_id\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"germany\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"has_parent\": {\n          \"parent_type\": \"tank\",\n          \"query\": {\n            \"term\": {\n              \"nation\": \"germany\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"count\": {\n          \"value_count\": {\n            \"field\": \"_id\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut it's VERY uncomfortable and I must know all the terms of nation field. So, I'm asking for some kind of parent aggregation.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
