Maybe you can elaborate on what you want to do. If you simply want to cache the response, is it really important, if the `took` value is included in the response? I mean, does it matter? If an old took value is sent, because the search response is cached, what does this mean for you? Is that bad?\n\nI am not sure, how your caching is working either. Is that configurable? Or do you simply cache the result of a certain  request with a certain body? Maybe you can use the `X-Unique-Id` header for this (can be specified in the request and is included in the response as well), but I cannot really tell, until I understand your caching strategy (and why you are so focused on some fields :-)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/19942053","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2149#issuecomment-19942053","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2149","id":19942053,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTQyMDUz","user":{"login":"xstevens","id":69216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xstevens","html_url":"https://github.com/xstevens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xstevens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xstevens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xstevens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xstevens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xstevens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xstevens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xstevens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xstevens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xstevens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-24T22:57:06Z","updated_at":"2013-06-24T22:57:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm just trying to do basic HTTP response caching with no knowledge that's it is even ElasticSearch that I'm talking to.

The reason why the \"took\" field is a problem is because the caching mechanism is checking on whether the payload (search result in this case) has changed in the background. So it's invalidating the cache more often than it needs to.
