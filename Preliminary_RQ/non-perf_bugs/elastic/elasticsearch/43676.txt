and health is green, but now I want to integrate user login and I got this error\r\n\r\n>Failed to determine the health of the cluster running at http://192.168.1.142:9200\r\nUnexpected response code [503] from calling GET http://192.168.1.142:9200/_cluster/health?pretty\r\nCause: master_not_discovered_exception\r\nIt is recommended that you resolve the issues with your cluster before running elasticsearch-setup-passwords.\r\nIt is very likely that the password changes will fail when run against an unhealthy cluster.\r\nDo you want to continue with the password setup process [y/N]N\r\n\r\nI have tried to\r\n>curl -XGET 192.168.1.142:9300\r\n\r\nAnd the response is:\r\n>This is not an HTTP port\r\n\r\nAnd If I try to 9200, it response with `missing authentication token for REST request[/]`\r\nI think it's reasonable because now I'm using login and is asking for user/password\r\n\r\nIf you can this is my other issue which is in Elastic Forums [LINK](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/trobling-with-https-configuration/187557) and ref this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","closed_by":{"login":"henningandersen","id":33268011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjY4MDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/33268011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen","html_url":"https://github.com/henningandersen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henningandersen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
