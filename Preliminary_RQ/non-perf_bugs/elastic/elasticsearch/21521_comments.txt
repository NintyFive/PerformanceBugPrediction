Handling lambdas as first-class citizens with a def type proved to be too complex for the benefit.  Lambdas really are just sugar, so I would hope that a user will be able to come up with a work around if they need something this complex in a script.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/261499418","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21521#issuecomment-261499418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21521","id":261499418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTQ5OTQxOA==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T10:29:53Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T10:29:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with @jdconrad  that there is quite some complexity here. I also think we don't have enough data-points in terms of user feedback if this is really needed and if there are situations were we can't work around.
