The exact same package, `shadow-utils-4.6-5.el7.x86_64`, failed again in a CentOS 7 Docker image on a Debian 8 CI worker in https://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+7.x+multijob-unix-compatibility/os=debian-8&&immutable/299/console\r\n\r\n```\r\n11:54:25 Error unpacking rpm package 2:shadow-utils-4.6-5.el7.x86_64\r\n11:54:25   Updating   : 2:shadow-utils-4.6-5.el7.x86_64                              1/2 \r\n11:54:25 error: unpacking of archive failed on file /usr/bin/newgidmap;5d948f8a: cpio: cap_set_file\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1738233 gave me a hint that the problem might be that the kernel of the Debian 8 host does not support the `cap_set_file` syscall that the CentOS 7 Docker image is trying to use.  But that would be quite weird because CentOS 7 uses a 3.10 kernel whereas Debian 8 has a 3.16 kernel, so you would think that the newer host kernel would support all the syscalls that the older container userland wanted to use.\r\n\r\nThen I found https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/6980 which sounds like the same problem on a different package.  There is an idea to fix it in https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/461#issuecomment-318786850.
