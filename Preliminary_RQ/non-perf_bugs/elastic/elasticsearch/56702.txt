is a small memory leak in `org.elasticsearch.repositories.s3.S3Service`'s handling of `S3ClientSettings`.\r\nIf you use a repository definition that includes any setting override in the `Settings` in `RepositoryMetadata` like e.g. `endpoint` then the cached settings instance will never be removed from `org.elasticsearch.repositories.s3.S3Service#derivedClientSettings` when closing the repository even though it's not used by any client any longer.\r\n\r\nA reproducer test for the issue would be:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public void testCachedClientsAreReleased() {\r\n        final S3Service s3Service = new S3Service();\r\n        final Settings settings = Settings.builder().put(\"endpoint\", \"http://first\").build();\r\n        final RepositoryMetadata metadata = new RepositoryMetadata(\"first\", \"s3\", settings);\r\n        final S3ClientSettings clientSettings = s3Service.settings(metadata);\r\n        final AmazonS3Reference reference = s3Service.client(metadata);\r\n        reference.close();\r\n        s3Service.close();\r\n        final AmazonS3Reference referenceReloaded = s3Service.client(metadata);\r\n        assertNotSame(referenceReloaded, reference);\r\n        referenceReloaded.close();\r\n        s3Service.close();\r\n        final S3ClientSettings clientSettingsReloaded = s3Service.settings(metadata);\r\n        assertNotSame(clientSettings, clientSettingsReloaded);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last line currently fails, because even though no client remains that uses the `clientSettings` instance the cache still finds cached settings for the given metadata.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is practically a non-issue and has been around ever since at least 6.8.x without any one noticing. We should still fix the logic in `S3Service` to properly clean up the settings cache at some point.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
