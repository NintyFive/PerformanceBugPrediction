I think most users don't know if a community plugin is available on github or maven or something else. \n\nHere's what I've done in #9998: \n\nI updated the plugin manager to add a notion of [plugins repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/9998/files#diff-196560d7540091985eaa960c6472daafR27). Each repository can have multiple URL patterns (the defaults are [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/9998/files#diff-9030409020becbc44b2a241180305d0fR528)). An URL pattern is used to convert the user input like `elasticsearch/marvel/latest', 'elastic/marvel' or 'marvel' into a final URL that will be tested. If the URL works, the plugin is downloaded and installed. Otherwise it will try the next pattern. When all patterns are tested and failed, it can try another plugins repo or fails the install.\n\nBecause URL patterns are tested in order and plugins repositories can be chained, and because default URL patterns for our download service are:\n\n```\nhttp://download.elasticsearch.org/[organisation]/[name]/[name]-[version].zip\nhttp://download.elasticsearch.org/[organisation]/elasticsearch-[name]/elasticsearch-[name]-[version].zip\nhttp://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/[name]/[name]-latest.zip\n```\n\nthe following commands will work:\n\n```\nbin/plugin install marvel                                          (match the 3rd pattern)\nbin/plugin install elasticsearch/marvel/latest          (match the 1st pattern)\nbin/plugin install elastic/marvel/latest                     (match the 3rd pattern)\n```\n\nThere are default plugins repositories defined for sonatype, github and maven. A fixed URL or an URL pattern can explicitly be defined with the --url option. \n\nAnother nice thing I'd like to add once the PR is merged is the ability for users to define their own plugins repository in configuration like bintray, jcenter or a shared filesystem (with a pattern like file:///path/to/my/plugins/[name]-[version].zip). It could help a lot with deployments where there's no external access.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/86420393","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10254#issuecomment-86420393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10254","id":86420393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NDIwMzkz","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-26T09:32:54Z","updated_at":"2015-03-26T09:32:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tlrx
