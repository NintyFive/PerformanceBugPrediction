For instance, in a single node cluster, maybe you want to assign a primary and a replica to the same node on different disks (and perhaps there's a way to optimize keeping them in sync since they are on the same node).  In another use case, you have a machine with a 1TB NVMe and a 10TB magnetic spinner and need to assign the most active shards to the NVMe before re-allocating them to the magnetic drive when they cool down.\r\n\r\nNote, this is similar to #43518 and https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17213#issuecomment-383974707 but specific to disk level allocation.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
