guys,\n\nI have a situation where i'd like to remove common words based on a cutoff frequency and a low frequent term minimum_should_match.\n\nThe common terms query is just perfect for this job!\n\nBut i would also like to have a \"fuzziness\" on low frequent terms and only on low frequent terms. \n\nUsing the query string query don't give the expected results because words like \"and\" would match words like \"brand\", \"band\", ect... with a fuzziness of 0.6.\n\nI think adding a fuzzy features to common terms query would do the job.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThank you\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
