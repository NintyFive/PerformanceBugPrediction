The PR should be ready on Monday morning. I think we just didn’t consider it necessary originally. It certainly fixes the collision cases we’ve seen.\r\n\r\nThe biggest question is now what happens if someone upgrades from a version with the old IDs to a version with the new ones. I haven’t yet checked if this makes duplicate results likely in any situation.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
