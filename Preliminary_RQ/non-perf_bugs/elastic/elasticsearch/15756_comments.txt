We will provide a fix for the next release. If you can't wait for the next release, you might try the following before upgrading to 2.x (try it first on a test cluster, and make backups before proceeding): Close indices. Update settings of indices by changing PathHierarchy to path_hierarchy. Open indices. That should be it. You can then upgrade to 2.x.\n\nExample (tested on 1.7.4):\n\n```\n\n# This is the example index we start with\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:9200/myindex/ -d'\n{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"analysis\": {\n      \"analyzer\": {\n        \"path-analyzer\": {\n          \"type\": \"custom\",\n          \"tokenizer\": \"path-tokenizer\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"tokenizer\": {\n        \"path-tokenizer\": {\n          \"type\": \"PathHierarchy\",\n          \"delimiter\": \".\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"text\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"analyzer\": \"path-analyzer\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n\n# Close index\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:9200/myindex/_close\n\n# Update settings by changing PathHierarchy to path_hierarchy\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/myindex/_settings -d'\n{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"analysis\": {\n      \"analyzer\": {\n        \"path-analyzer\": {\n          \"type\": \"custom\",\n          \"tokenizer\": \"path-tokenizer\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"tokenizer\": {\n        \"path-tokenizer\": {\n          \"type\": \"path_hierarchy\",\n          \"delimiter\": \".\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n\n# reopen index\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:9200/myindex/_open\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/169327924","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15756#issuecomment-169327924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15756","id":169327924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTMyNzkyNA==","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-06T13:51:19Z","updated_at":"2016-01-06T13:51:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed in #15785\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
