I think the root of the problem is that some tests fail with ES_TEST_LOCAL=false on Travis.  They also happen to fail on my laptop which is convenient.  Anyway, the failure represents itself as the test hanging for a very long time.  Eventually the test fails and, at least on travis, logs a ton of errors.  So many that Travis gives up recording them all.  I don't see it fail quite like that, but it still fails.  This causes the failure for me:\n\n```\nmvn test -Dtests.seed=DB99E9BF3586634B -Dtests.class=org.elasticsearch.search.facet.termsstats.ShardSizeTermsStatsFacetTests -Dtests.prefix=tests
