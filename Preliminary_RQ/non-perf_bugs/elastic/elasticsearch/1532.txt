The request should be sent in the following format (indicating the cluster name requested):\n\n```\n{\n    \"request\" : {\n        \"cluster_name\": \"test_cluster\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd the response will be similar to node info response (with node level information only, including transport/http addresses, and node attributes):\n\n```\n{\n    \"response\" : {\n        \"cluster_name\" : \"test_cluster\",\n        \"transport_address\" : \"...\",\n        \"http_address\" : \"...\",\n        \"attributes\" : {\n            \"...\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote, it can still be enabled, with disabled internal multicast discovery, but still have external discovery working by keeping `discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled` set to `true` (the default), but, setting `discovery.zen.ping.multicast.ping.enabled` to `false`.\n## Orinal Request:\n\nI would like to write a client that uses multicast to determine the members of a cluster.\n\nHow would this work?\n1. Send multicast ping with JSON.\n2. Multicast pong with cluster details in JSON\n3.
