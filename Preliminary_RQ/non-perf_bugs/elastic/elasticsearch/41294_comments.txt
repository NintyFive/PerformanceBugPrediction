You're using the `whitespace` tokenizer, which leaves the hyphen intact, so the snowball stemmer sees the phrase `off-white` as a single token and therefore long enough to apply step 5.  If you enter `offwhite` into the demo site you'll see that it gets stemmed.  You can either use the standard tokenizer, which splits tokens on hyphens, or if they're important then you can insert a `word-delimiter` filter which will keep the original token but also break it into constituent parts.\r\n\r\nDon't forget that stemming also needs to be applied at query time - I'm guessing the problem here is that you're indexing the phrase `Off-White` but people are searching for `off white`?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
