Right now it seems like ElasticSearch only supports binding port 9200 to an actual Ethernet interface. The problem with this is that it means any non-privileged user on an ElasticSearch host has access to do destructive things (_unless you're running the Shield plugin_) to the cluster.\r\n\r\nI would like to configure ElasticSearch to bind to a unix file socket, and then be able to control the permissions to that file socket with standard Unix file permissions. From there, we can easily use Apache to provide a reasonable level of authenticated access.\r\n\r\n**Note about plugins**:\r\nI know that there are plugins like https://github.com/sscarduzio/elasticsearch-readonlyrest-plugin that help provide authorization to the REST interface. The problem is that these have to be compiled and managed for each specific version of ElasticSearch, and we're just tired of playing that game. Fronting ElasticSearch with Apache has a ton of advantages (centralized logging being a huge one) ... and its just a common design.","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
