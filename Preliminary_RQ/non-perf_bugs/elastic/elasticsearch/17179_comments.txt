@JamesBromberger for reporting the issue.\n\nI went through the code, looks like it do have the `canned acl`.  I'm a bit confused here, I saw you have two accounts here, looks like your Elasticsearch is using account A, and it is trying to use a bucket  created by account B?\n\nPlease correct me if I'm missing something here. Based on the errors msg, ES complains that it doesn't have the permission to write to the bucket. And I think the feature in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/14297 is for specifying a canned in your request when creating a resource. For example, if you set `log-delivery-write`, it would grant write permission to the Amazon S3 `LogDelivery` group. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/247614344","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17179#issuecomment-247614344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17179","id":247614344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzYxNDM0NA==","user":{"login":"jlintz","id":121029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/121029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlintz","html_url":"https://github.com/jlintz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlintz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlintz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlintz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlintz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlintz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlintz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlintz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlintz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlintz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-16T14:26:19Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T14:26:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm seeing this on ES 2.4.0,  I get an access denied but the repository is still created and I'm able to snapshot to it successfully.
