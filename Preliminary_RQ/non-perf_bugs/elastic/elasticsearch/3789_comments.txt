Once we can, we will publish the first content of the book. The book content will be available publicly, and we will accept pull requests for it, though at the initial beta phase of the book, I suspect we will move fast and things will change quickly. The aim of the book will be to provide context based documentation.\n- The guide: The aim for the guide is to remain a reference guide, with the book covering the more of a context based documentation. We happily accept pull request, but they need to be good, and something that we can feel as a community that we can maintain if the contributor of them goes away. The guide needs a lot more work, for example, having good examples on each analyzer. We have spent a lot of time moving all the current guide to the docs folder under the repo, to make sure it will be properly versioned, and a pull request will now also contain changes to the doc including the code. The guide will remain there and heavily maintained even when the book comes out.\n- The thought around tutorials is to start, under docs (on elasticsearch repo) a cookbook like section. The problems with tutorials is that its another high maintenance section of docs. We want to make sure they won't go out of date. Thats why, btw, we moved to the docs folder in the main repo (and build a whole infrastructure around it for publishing), so it will be versioned, and hopefully more easily maintained by \"moving with the code\". The decision on which cookbook to add will require a lot of thought, to make sure its of high quality and well structured, compared to just one offs here and there that are forgotten.\n  \n  The main reason I am cautious here is the bad experience I had with the old tutorials section, where content got contributed, went out of date, and it fell on me (at the time) to make sure its up to date, because the contributor was not around, was busy, or did not want to contribute any more.\n- There is _no_ thought around overlapping or competing content compared to training. If there is good content, we will add it (one would say that the book and the guide compete with training materials, or blog posts, thats pure nonsense, we went through great lengths to make sure the book will be available online). \n\nI want to stress the point that when something goes into the docs, its going to have to be well maintained so users won't get out of date information. Its important not to confuse documentation for a project with blog posts...\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/25241505","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3789#issuecomment-25241505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3789","id":25241505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjQxNTA1","user":{"login":"lukas-vlcek","id":205174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/205174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek","html_url":"https://github.com/lukas-vlcek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-27T12:28:29Z","updated_at":"2013-09-27T12:28:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Shay,\nI would like apology to you, Elasticsearch folks and rest of the community if I acted offensively.

We decided to use Rivers at some point because they seemed to be a good fit for want we wanted and this meant we needed to dive into this thing... and missing JavaDoc turned out to be a pain because we needed a lot more than simple River `start()` and `close()`.

I think part of Lukas' frustration is that he remembers when the elasticsearch project was a lot more open. Upcoming features were known and feedback was rapid. With the incorporation of elasticsearch the company, that world is now farther away. I personally have not heard about the book and I read almost every e-mail on the list, as well as most of the issues and commits on GitHub. The elasticsearch project is much bigger right now and there is no returning to 2010. The large volume of commits lately demonstrates the need for many new features and goes beyond what one person and open-source can do (for now).\n\nGetting back on topic, the more documentation, the better. :) Shay, you mentioned that both the book and the guide both will be context based. I think that is one of the current issues with the current documentation is that it is too reference driven. For example, many mailing lists can be answered if there was a section on analysis. Deployment options? Another tutorial. Currently the documentation is viewed from the bottom-up, with documentation focused at the module level, when I think it should be from the top-down. Cookbooks are great for power users such as myself.\n\nI would also add that (hosted) versioned documentation is important as well and deals slightly with having out-of-date information. If a user is asking for help about version 0.19, having correct-for-that-version documentation greatly helps.\n\nBTW, Compass had great documentation.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/25581565","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3789#issuecomment-25581565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3789","id":25581565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTgxNTY1","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-02T22:12:01Z","updated_at":"2013-10-02T22:12:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@brusic: Some thoughts:\n- Regarding being more open on features, we always moved quite fast when it came to features. We are also open on the large features planned to 1.0, like aggregations, snapshot/restore, and distributed percolation. Other features are basically coming as they are, based mostly on user feedback (issues, mailing list, ...), and we open issues to reflect them and get feedback. I do take your input, and we will check where we can be more open, sometimes, we do brainstorm on something like Aggregations before opening an issue for it, cause we have no idea how its going to look like, and the issue should include at least first thoughts around it, otherwise don't really have an issue to discuss here... \n- Regarding being open about the book, we simply can't share the plans on how it progress while things are not properly settled. We were open for a few months now that a book is in the works (we mentioned it on webinars, twitter, answers we gave regarding questions on documentation), and we want to have it available for free online, and it will be the basis for our context based documentation. I guess we could have done better with potentially mailing a note to the mailing list as well...\n- The reference guide will remain a reference guide, not context based documentation. I think our projects needs both forms of documentation. For example, understand what analysis is, and then have reference docs with all the features of a specific analyzer. I do think we need to have a full review / fresh look of our current reference docs, and improve on them, including more examples. \n\n@benmccann I disagree that its better to have bad / not working tutorials compared to no tutorials. It creates a lot of frustration for our users (as I experienced). The problem of the need for tutorials is obviously there, and the way I see it, we solve it partially with the book (i.e. what is analysis), and with a curated list of cookbooks in the docs that are well maintained and are part of the code repo to make sure they are properly changed with relevant changes.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/25719246","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3789#issuecomment-25719246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3789","id":25719246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzE5MjQ2","user":{"login":"brusic","id":354105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/354105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic","html_url":"https://github.com/brusic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-04T18:12:39Z","updated_at":"2013-10-04T18:12:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The official elasticsearch blogs (there are two) never get discussed on the mailing list (I am a news junkie, long live RSS!), but they just posted something about the documentation: http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/docs-docs-docs/\n\nNot a fan of O'Reilly despite my bookshelf containing nothing but animal covers at one point, but still excited for the book.
