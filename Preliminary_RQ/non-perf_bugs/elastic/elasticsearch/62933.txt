it's actually a value which means in case of string values that need escaping one would need to use `\"` not `` ` ``.\r\nThat is:\r\n`\"eventType\" where condition` and *not* `` `eventType` where condition`` and by translation, in case of raw strings:\r\n`\"\"\"eventType\"\"\" where condition `.\r\n\r\nThat said, since in most queries the value is not quoted, a dedicated grammar declaration is required to allow declaration without `\"` though my recommendation for generated queries is to always use that.\r\n\r\nFurther more the notion of identifier inside the grammar needs cleaning up. It is currently used for:\r\na. event category checks (as mentioned above)\r\nb. actual identifiers (which raises the question of escaping backticks)\r\nc. function names \r\n\r\nThere is too much overloading and while there is a common base between these types, their characteristics and not separated. This can lead to a case where a function declaration can use backticks which is invalid.","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
