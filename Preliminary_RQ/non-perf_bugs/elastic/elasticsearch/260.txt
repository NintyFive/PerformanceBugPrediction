There is a memory monitor to control if there are memory problems and then do a flush to clean it (on the most expensive shards) as well as auto flush each N (5000) number of operations. Still, this memory can be of good use other than the translog.\n\nA file system based translog will hold the changes on a file. There is no need to flush / fsync it since its not really used for full shutdown recovery (the gateway is there for that) so it should be fast enough.\n\nIt should be used as the default as well for better out of the box experience.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
