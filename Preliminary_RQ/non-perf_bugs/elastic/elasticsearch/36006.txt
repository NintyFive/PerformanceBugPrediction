It would be convienent to have a direct way to pass a collection of nodes as argument of the RestClient.builder method. In some situations, the nodes that will be used by the client can only be known at runtime and you can't use the RestClient.builder(Node â€¦ nodes) method.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I have to do an ugly thing like that (tested code) :\r\n\r\n```\r\nNode fakeNode = new Node(HttpHost.create(\"http://localhost:9200\"))) // Non-sense params\r\nthis.elasticClient = new RestHighLevelClient(RestClient.builder(fakeNode));\r\nthis.elasticClient.getLowLevelClient().setNodes(nodes); // Real nodes\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote : the fake node can have any configuration, it seems it does not matter. The machine I used for the test did not run the ElasticSearch service.","closed_by":{"login":"Zanfas","id":18611220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjExMjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18611220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zanfas","html_url":"https://github.com/Zanfas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zanfas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zanfas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zanfas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zanfas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zanfas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zanfas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zanfas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zanfas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zanfas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
