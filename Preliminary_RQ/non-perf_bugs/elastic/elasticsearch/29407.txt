When the task is done, the user can no longer GET the task, it returns 403. No cluster privilege allows this call for non-superusers.\r\n\r\nWhat should happen:\r\nEither the documentation should be updated with a reference to done tasks, or the cluster/monitor privilege should include non-pending tasks.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the current docs/behaviour is unexpected.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Let a user have cluster/monitor privilege AND sufficient index privileges for index _a_ and _b_ such that the user can reindex _a_ into _b_.\r\n 2. Reindex _a_ into _b_ with `wait_for_completion=false`\r\n 3. While the task is pending/running, `GET _tasks/<returned task id>`\r\n 4. Wait for task completion.\r\n 5. `GET _tasks/<task id from before>`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
