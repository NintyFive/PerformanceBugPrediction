Ideally it should return zero results too instead of failing right?\n\n```\n{\n  \"multi_match\" : {\n    \"query\":    \"this is a test\", \n    \"fields\": [ \"ms*\" ] \n  }\n}\n```\n\nI have a use case where fields are dynamically added to the mapping and users can provide the field name to match search text on. Fields added to the mapping also have a metadata string appended to their names which the user may not be aware about. Hence I need to use wildcards in the field name in a `multi_match` query and there are chances that no field name matches too.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
