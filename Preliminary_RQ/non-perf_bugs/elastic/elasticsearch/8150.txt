For instance:\n- #4272 asks for per-index routing values, which would need to be passed in the body\n- #7298 raises the problem of limited space for index names in the URL\n- #7570 complains about parsing errors being returned from all shards, rather than just one\n- #6719 would allow terms-lookup filters, geo-shape lookup filters, indexed scripts or indexed templates to be fetched just once, instead of by every shard\n\nAll of the above (and possibly more?) could be fixed if we parsed the search request in the body. Should we consider doing this? What are the downsides? Would it be worth making it optional?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
