docId that is checked in the parent bitset should always be smaller than `maxDoc` though in your issue it seems that there is a discrepancy between the reader that is used for search and the one used to fetch the documents. Since this query executes the query and the fetch phase in a single pass this should never happen unless a third party plugin messes with the reader.\r\nI checked a bit what SearchGuard is doing and it seems that the searcher/reader is wrapped in this plugin in order to add a security layer on top of ES search. This is an expert feature and I suspect that the wrapper breaks some assumption in Lucene/ES. \r\nConsidering that the SearchGuard plugin adds a search layer on top of ES, I'd advise to first see if the problem is related to SearchGuard (which I suspect) and open an issue there or to try to reproduce the problem without SearchGuard.\r\nEither case I'll close this issue for now since there is no proof that ES is responsible for this.

This should never happen so the query tree should filter the list of candidates to lookup.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/291997613","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23628#issuecomment-291997613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23628","id":291997613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTk5NzYxMw==","user":{"login":"ojundt","id":3025911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjU5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3025911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojundt","html_url":"https://github.com/ojundt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojundt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojundt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojundt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojundt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojundt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojundt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojundt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojundt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojundt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-05T21:08:21Z","updated_at":"2017-04-05T21:08:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Alright, after some confusion and further drilling down I was able to consistently reproduce the error with the following setup:\r\n\r\nQuery (in query.json):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"function_score\": {\r\n      \"functions\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"script_score\": {\r\n            \"script\": {\r\n              \"lang\": \"painless\",\r\n              \"inline\": \"-1 / doc['value'].value\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPUT 'localhost:9205/twitter/tweet/1?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{ \"value\" : 0.0 }'\r\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9205/twitter/_search?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @query.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"took\" : 6,\r\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\r\n  \"_shards\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 5,\r\n    \"successful\" : 4,\r\n    \"failed\" : 1,\r\n    \"failures\" : [\r\n      {\r\n        \"shard\" : 3,\r\n        \"index\" : \"twitter\",\r\n        \"node\" : \"9D1hkKznR867YomO_6WtgA\",\r\n        \"reason\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"index_out_of_bounds_exception\",\r\n          \"reason\" : \"docID must be >= 0 and < maxDoc=1 (got docID=2147483647)\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"hits\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 1,\r\n    \"max_score\" : null,\r\n    \"hits\" : [ ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you may argue that division by zero is stupid anyway. Agree, but I'd expect a much different error message. Also, if you change `-1 / doc['value'].value` by `1 / doc['value'].value` it suddenly works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"took\" : 10,\r\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\r\n  \"_shards\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 5,\r\n    \"successful\" : 5,\r\n    \"failed\" : 0\r\n  },\r\n  \"hits\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 1,\r\n    \"max_score\" : 3.4028235E38,\r\n    \"hits\" : [\r\n      {\r\n        \"_index\" : \"twitter\",\r\n        \"_type\" : \"invoice\",\r\n        \"_id\" : \"1\",\r\n        \"_score\" : 3.4028235E38,\r\n        \"_source\" : {\r\n          \"value\" : 0.0\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this gives you guys a clear test case :)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
