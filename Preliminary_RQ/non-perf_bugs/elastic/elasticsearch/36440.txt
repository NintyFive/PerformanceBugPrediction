This adds more meaning to the content however breaks the convention that it maps the elasticsearch date type.\r\nOn the upside there's no collision with the SQL types and allows the SQL `date` type if needed.\r\n\r\n2. rename date to `timestamp`\r\n\r\nThis is a variant of 1 however it follows the SQL terminology which might be both confusing and clear.\r\n\r\n3. don't expose ES types in the queries\r\n\r\nPrevent the problem from exposing by not allowing the user to create the ES data types (typically through `CAST` - `CAST ('1' AS KEYWORD)`. This will impact testing and be asymmetric since such types are returned as results. Further more, the confusion around `date` remains since it shows up in the table description.","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
