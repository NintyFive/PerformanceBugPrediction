Motivating use case:  I am working with an index that has specialized binary payloads that need to be accessed from a plugin class derived from AbstractDoubleSearchScript, for custom scoring.  Iterating over payloads leads to TermPosition objects.  The binary payloads in this case may be wider than 32 bits, and so will not fit into `int` or `float`.  And I do not want to use `String`, because the payload data does not represent characters and so I do not want/need character set encoding.  Having ruled out getting this payload as String, float or int leads to the idea of the new method proposed above.\n","closed_by":{"login":"steinar-flatland","id":17234861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM0ODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17234861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steinar-flatland","html_url":"https://github.com/steinar-flatland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steinar-flatland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steinar-flatland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steinar-flatland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steinar-flatland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steinar-flatland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steinar-flatland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steinar-flatland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steinar-flatland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steinar-flatland/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
