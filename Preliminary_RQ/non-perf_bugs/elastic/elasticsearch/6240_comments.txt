In fact I opened one that was very similar several years ago (https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/2309).\n\nI think that there are too many different data models and ways of indexing to be able to support them all with more complex APIs.  The append only use case is different from the update use case.  Multiple indices that exist because you're transitioning mapping is different from multiple indices reflecting time periods. \n\nInstead, we provide the primitives that allow you to do exactly what you need application side.  You can use the primitives to implement your exact model (eg using one alias for search across multiple indices, and one alias for the current write index).\n\nThanks for opening the issue, but we've decided against doing anything more here for now.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62679195","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6240#issuecomment-62679195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6240","id":62679195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjc5MTk1","user":{"login":"yeroc","id":54356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/54356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeroc","html_url":"https://github.com/yeroc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeroc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeroc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeroc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeroc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeroc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeroc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeroc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeroc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeroc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-12T07:14:31Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T07:14:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley I agree that the proposal above was too complex and could be easily satisfied with multiple aliases (no need for the routing etc.) but that still doesn't address the situation where you need to index into multiple indexes while transitioning to a new index.  It sounds like you've only considered the case where users only need to index into a single index (eg. for time-based partitioning of indices).  \n\nThe other use case is where we actually need to write updates into two (or more) indices during index rebuilds.  Right now, we have to query a write-alias for its underlying indices and write to each one individually.  This leaves us open to race conditions (how often do we query the write-alias to get the current list of indices?  If we query too often, we hurt performance, on the flip side we end up writing to an alias we shouldn't be...)  so I respectfully disagree with the statement that the required primitives are in place today for this use case.  \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62708711","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6240#issuecomment-62708711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6240","id":62708711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzA4NzEx","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-12T12:05:57Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T12:05:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yeroc no, I did consider that case as well, and I agree with you that the primitives are not yet in place to handle this easily.

The Changes API enhancement that @clintongormley mentions as an alternative remains open since 2011 with seemingly little to no traction.  It would be great if Elastic would reconsider this ticket as having multiple writable indexes against a single alias seems like a much more achievable solution to this issue.  Sadly, I believe Elastic are much more focused on the APM space than on the core search product.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
