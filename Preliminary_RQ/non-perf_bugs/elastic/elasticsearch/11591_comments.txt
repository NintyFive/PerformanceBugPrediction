One idea is to create _alias_ methods in QueryBuilders such as (or something like)\n\n```\nQueryBuilders.jsonWrapperQuery(String)\nQueryBuilders.jsonWrapperQuery(bytes)\nQueryBuilders.yamlWrapperQuery(String)\nQueryBuilders.yamlWrapperQuery(bytes)\n```\n\netc...\n\nThese methods would simply forward the input to the target method: `wrapperQuery()` so they would only exist for clarity.\n\nIf you can tolerate these extra convenience methods it might make it easier for someone to locate the method they need.\n\nOr maybe there's a cleaner way someone will think of. Or maybe it is just a documentation thing; I found it hard to locate the method I needed. \n\nThanks very much,\nMatt\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/111427812","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11591#issuecomment-111427812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11591","id":111427812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTQyNzgxMg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-12T09:28:08Z","updated_at":"2015-06-12T09:28:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"XContentQueryBuilder is probably no more meaningful than WrapperQuery.
