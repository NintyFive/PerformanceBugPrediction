If you (like me) need to return a word count of a field then this could be useful to you.  I also could get a count of distinct terms but I'm not super sure who'd use it.  I was thinking the api could be something like this:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XPOST \"http://localhost:9200/test/test/_search?pretty\" -d '{\n  \"fields\": [ \"foo._term_count\" ],\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n      \"query\": \"findme\"\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nAnd it'd return `\"foo._term_count\" : 6,` in the results.\n\nIt'd require `term_vector`s to be stored but not offsets or positions.  Since it'd count the terms on each search result it'd be similar to highlighting using the FVH but faster because it does essentially no work other than the term vector scanning.\n\nI don't imagine you'd be able to sort by them.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
