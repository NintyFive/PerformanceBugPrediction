The curl is local, so no network involved. Noticed, if I repeat quickly the same curl, it responds 5 times and the 6th just hangs for hours... I tried to strace the curl and it hangs in a recvfrom syscall, also watched the traffic with tcpdump, and not packets are coming from the process.\r\n\r\nAfter the 6th requests the next 5 requests will get answers and the 6th none again, so the pattern is reproducible.\r\n\r\nthe other nodes work well. the cluster state is green. thread_pools queues are mostly 0     \r\n\r\nex. curl: \r\n`curl localhost:9200/_cluster/state > /dev/null`\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1. \r\n 2.\r\n 3.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\nThere are no messages neither in the es logs or in system logs.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
