In logstash.err, ther is the following trace :\n\nOct 09, 2015 9:58:17 AM org.apache.http.impl.execchain.RetryExec execute\nINFO: Retrying request to {}->http://10.176.61.21:9200\nNoMethodError: undefined method `to_iso8601' for nil:NilClass\n         to_s at /opt/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/1.9/gems/logstash-core-1.5.4-java/lib/logstash/event.rb:109\n  retry_flush at /opt/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/1.9/gems/logstash-output-elasticsearch-1.0.7-java/lib/logstash/outputs/elasticsearch.rb:729\n        times at org/jruby/RubyFixnum.java:275\n         each at org/jruby/RubyEnumerator.java:274\n          map at org/jruby/RubyEnumerable.java:764\n  retry_flush at /opt/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/1.9/gems/logstash-output-elasticsearch-1.0.7-java/lib/logstash/outputs/elasticsearch.rb:724\n     register at /opt/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/1.9/gems/logstash-output-elasticsearch-1.0.7-java/lib/logstash/outputs/elasticsearch.rb:480\n\nLooking at elasticsearch.rb, the application crashes while trying to log an error :\n@logger.error \"too many attempts at sending event. dropping: #{next_event}\"\n\nLooking at event.rb, the to_s function (called when trying to log the event) assumes there is an existing timestamp field. But from the trace I suspect this field does not always exist. So Logstash crashes when trying to call to_is8601 on a non-existing timestamp.\n\nThe fix seems simple : testing if the timestamp field exists before trying to call its to_iso8601 method.\nSorry, I cannot submit a patch since I do not know anything about ruby.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
