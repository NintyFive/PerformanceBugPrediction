You can workaround by creating a copy of default analyzer with a different name, but this change is non-obvious and difficult to notice if you arent looking for it, since it just silently ignores the settings for search_analyzer and uses ones with different results.\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n 1.\n\n```\nPUT test/_mapping/my_type\n{\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"field\" : {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"search_analyzer\": \"default\",\n      \"analyzer\" : \"custom_analyzer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n 2.\n\n```\nGET test/_mapping/my_type\nreturns:\n\"user\" : {\n    \"mappings\" : {\n      \"user\" : {\n        \"_all\" : {\n          \"enabled\" : false\n        },\n{\n  ...\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"field\" : {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"analyzer\" : \"custom_analyzer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhereas you get back both analyzers if you do not set to default\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
