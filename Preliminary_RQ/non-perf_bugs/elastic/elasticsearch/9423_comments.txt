You can't extend it and use another runner. If you are interested in parametrized tests though, the randomized-testing project provides its own `@ParametersFactory` annotation that is compatibile with the randomized runner. We use it in `ElasticsearchRestTests` if you want to look at an example.\n\nI don't see where we could document this to be honest, it's more something to be aware of since we use randomized-testing.
