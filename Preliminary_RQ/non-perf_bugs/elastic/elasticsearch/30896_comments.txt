Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. \r\nI'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. If it turns out there is some functionality missing after discussing this in the forums, I encourage you to re-open this issue here, maybe with a link to the previous forum discussion. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
