The documentation for 6.x has been updated reflecting the fact that we are removing the ability to have multiple doc types in a single index. In the future there will be no such thing as doc types when indexing documents or modifying mappings so we have updated the documentation to reflect the changes and have made the doc types `_doc` everywhere. So although the document in the referenced link represents a user, its doc_type is `_doc`.\r\n\r\n/cc @jpountz @elastic/es-search-aggs ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/372705067","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29016#issuecomment-372705067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29016","id":372705067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjcwNTA2Nw==","user":{"login":"pschhikara88","id":10423836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDIzODM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10423836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschhikara88","html_url":"https://github.com/pschhikara88","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschhikara88/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschhikara88/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschhikara88/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschhikara88/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschhikara88/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschhikara88/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschhikara88/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschhikara88/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pschhikara88/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T15:25:37Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T15:25:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @colings86 .
