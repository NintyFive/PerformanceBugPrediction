Might be that one is using the JVM shipped/differently configured with your IDE, while the other one is using the one configured in JAVA_HOME. You can see the elasticsearch version in the node infos, by accessing `http://localhost:9200/_nodes?jvm=true`\n\nYou can easily ensure the above, by creating an embedded elasticsearch instance in the java application you create the `TransportClient` in like this\n\n```\nNode node = NodeBuilder.nodeBuilder().node().start()\n```\n\nApart from that, you seem to be pretty sure, that you use the same, so I guess your code sample is pretty small and you can put it up somewhere, and we can try to reproduce it? Seems really strange to me, if all versions are the same (JVM the same, elasticsearch the same, etc).\n\nDoes this happen with an empty elasticsearch (as in no data) cluster as well?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/25777236","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3835#issuecomment-25777236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3835","id":25777236,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Nzc3MjM2","user":{"login":"phrone","id":5619266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTkyNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5619266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrone","html_url":"https://github.com/phrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-06T21:29:30Z","updated_at":"2013-10-06T21:29:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oh, god, this is so embarrassing.. \nI got mislead by having the desired version of jdk checked in Eclipse's installed jre's and thinking this forces the IDE to use it when launching apps.
