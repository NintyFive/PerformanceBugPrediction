It would certainly be very helpful for me :-)\n\n**Describe the feature**:\nAllow configuring a ES cluster with specific time zone so that it is used instead of UTC when converting JSON time to epoch and when converting it back to string representation. This will allow applications targeted to a single time zone to work without having to always use complete date/time representation or convert dates (without time zone) to UTC before sending to ES for ingestion orqueries  \n\n**Rationale**\nWhen many \"consumers\" that are mostly use local time communicate with ES it is not easy to ensure that all of them convert local date/time to UTC or use full date/time with timezone when issuing their queries so it is quite possible that some will send local dates without time zones and get incorrect results. Also for applications that use large number of dates (time is not desired) having to send them in full date/time/zone form could noticeable increase _source size. \nI am not sure if using long date format with time (always 00:00:00 for this cases) would have any effect on bucketing\n\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/t/storing-dates-in-elastic-best-practices/57496\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
