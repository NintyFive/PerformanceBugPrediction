I used to work for a US based telco so I've implemented this kind of thing in the past but I don't know a tone about it once you get out of NANPA.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a super reasonable thing to do with Elasticsearch in an ingest processor, but I don't think this is a thing we're interested in implementing as part of Elasticsearch, at least not in the near future. If you are interested in implementing it as an open source plugin then ping me once you've put it somewhere and I'd be happy to review the code and just talk shop about telco stuff.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
