Beside Maven central / Sonatype, adding private repos should also be possible, to convince organizations that ES can rely on a self-controlled plugin ecosystem.\n\n@lukas-vlcek thanks for the hint to https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-apps :) I have opened a showcase of an ES 0.20.1 patched version, using a tool `bin/app` as a replacement for `bin/plugin` to show how a Maven repo dependency mechanism can be used from within an ES node startup.\n\nJust a note because github is now excluded: for small \"github blobs\" (around 1 MB or so?), some plugin zips could still be downloaded from within the repo area of github, via a HTTP GET from https://raw.github.com so I think it would also be nice to still include github, for example see https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/2477\n\nI find it very useful, as hinted to me by @kimchy, to offer the plugin mechanism also to non-Java folks and to make the plugins more polyglot in the future.\n\nBy re-using existing repo infrastructure out there, the core team won't have to monitor download.elasticsearch.org for availability and packaging policies - less janitor duties means more focusing on Elasticsearch core development :)\n\nThere are the ruby gems and the python easy_install repos out there. Of course, perl has CPAN (but does not run within a JVM).\n\nMaven 3 is getting more and more polyglot and is no longer Java-centric. \n\nAnyway, there is still work to do for real polyglot solutions. Smarter people than me were already busy with this. One approach showed how to package JRuby gems in a jar for Maven \n\nhttp://blog.nicksieger.com/articles/2009/01/10/jruby-1-1-6-gems-in-a-jar/\n\nand another one is for standalone Jython scripts\n\nhttp://mavenjython.sourceforge.net/\n\nThere is also a method for translating the POM into other languages - the Maven-specific polyglot approach\n\nhttps://github.com/tobrien/polyglot-maven\n\nI think it is not so relevant for ES plugin repo substitution to the missing github download right now, but it shows the power and flexibility of the Maven 3 core.\n\nSo I am optimistic there will be some usefulness in an unobtrusive Maven repo distribution method that may be valuable also for ES polyglot plugins.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/11723417","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2507#issuecomment-11723417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2507","id":11723417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzIzNDE3","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-28T02:03:15Z","updated_at":"2012-12-28T02:03:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've got my answer in the 0.20.2 release note:\n\n> Another change includes how plugins are downloaded.

So you can simply publish it to sonatype (or maven central through it), and it will download it from there. I guess in any case as a plugin developer you would like to provide the plugin on maven repo, so the current solution would work nicely there as well.\n\nLast, we might also end up allowing for people to upload plugins to `download.elasticsearch.org`. We will see. Its not a big effort on our end, assuming that maven is not enough, we can definitely do that.\n\nLets see how this solution evolves, and see what is left needed, and we can tackle it then.
