Currently, any failure or exception without ignore clauses in the pipeline results in a failure to index the document, and an error status code returned to the sender.  There should be an option to allow for pipeline failures, quit on the first failure that doesn't have explicit failure actions, and index the document as is.\r\n\r\nThere are some merits to failing closed with pipelines, but overall there's a general expectation that Ingest nodes will operate like Logstash; failures are tagged and sent through.  Blocking data streams on pipeline failure has the possibility of bringing down entire pipelines.  This is exacerbated by pipeline-to-pipeline communication, which can block on all data streams.
