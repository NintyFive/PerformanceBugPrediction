Due to the fact that it uses scripts it is slow (when compared to other aggregations) especially as the complexity of the scripts increase. It also is not able to support certain functions, for example, you cannot sort a terms aggregation by the `scripted_metric` aggregation.\n\nI think we should therefore move the `scripted_metric` aggregation to a plugin (not a module) so when users reach for it, it is a more explicit that this is an expert level aggregation\n","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
