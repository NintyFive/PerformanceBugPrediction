As the faulty instance recovered around five shards, the other instances seemingly lost connectivity to the faulty instance (ping timeouts) and they started leader election again. As they continued recovery, the faulty instance was still not able to respond to all requests within the timeouts, and left/rejoined the cluster a few times because of this. The leaving/rejoining caused the recovery process to take a lot longer time than expected because the faulty instance would be assigned shards for recovery, which seemed to block the two other, non-faulty, instances from recovering as fast as they would otherwise.\n\nWe caught on on this recovery fairly quickly, but decided to let it run for a while in order to see if we could at least get some stack traces and maybe some other relevant information to aid in a post-mortem. All in all, ElasticSearch coped rather well with the faulty host, except for this ArithmeticException and that it kept reassigning shards to the faulty instance, temporarily halting recovery to the working instances, but that might be expected.\n\nAs we replaced the EC2 instance, the issues went away and the cluster is now in a healthy state.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/13585942","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2589#issuecomment-13585942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2589","id":13585942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTg1OTQy","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-14T23:58:06Z","updated_at":"2013-02-14T23:58:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"was the problematic arithmetic failure happened on the faulty node (when you executed it using the local flag)?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/13586147","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2589#issuecomment-13586147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2589","id":13586147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTg2MTQ3","user":{"login":"nkvoll","id":391931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/391931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll","html_url":"https://github.com/nkvoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-15T00:04:12Z","updated_at":"2013-02-15T00:04:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No, the arithmetic failure only shows when asking from node stats for all the instances.
