However, if for some reason (due to a simple matter of programming error in our case ðŸ˜‰) the client is subsequently used, a not very helpful error is provided:\n\n```\norg.elasticsearch.client.transport.NoNodeAvailableException: None of the configured nodes are available: [{#transport#-1}{x.x.x.x}\n```\n\nThis error makes it sound like there's connectivity issues or something to the Elasticsearch cluster, which is not correct. Instead a more useful exception like `org.elasticsearch.client.transport.ClientStoppedException` should be created and thrown in this scenario.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Create a standard `TransportClient` and connect it to an existing Elasticsearch cluster.\n2. Call `stop()` on the client.\n3. Call `admin().cluster().prepareHealth().get()` or something similar on the client and observe the thrown error.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
