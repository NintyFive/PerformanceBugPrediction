I can easily see this timing out on an overloaded CI slave. In fact, if I lower this timeout to three milliseconds, the test sporadically passes and fails, supporting this theory. I do not understand the purpose of the timed wait here, I think that we should do an untimed wait here and let the test fail after the test timeout if for some reason the waiting thread is not unlatched.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/316307093","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25760#issuecomment-316307093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25760","id":316307093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjMwNzA5Mw==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T08:12:48Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T08:12:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Makes sense to me @jasontedor . The timeout was there from the early days (2014!) to prevent the test from running forever, not sure whether we had the suite timeout at the time, or whether this was just paranoia.
