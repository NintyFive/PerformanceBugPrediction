It looks like we only support arbitrary values for time units up to weeks in the TimeValue class.  This will be because above the weeks unit, the duration of time taken is variable so as TimeValue converts the interval to a fixed number of milliseconds it cannot support intervals with variable lengths.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/60364687","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6580#issuecomment-60364687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6580","id":60364687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMzY0Njg3","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-24T09:31:08Z","updated_at":"2014-10-24T09:31:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Relates to #7796\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/158650378","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6580#issuecomment-158650378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6580","id":158650378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODY1MDM3OA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-21T15:08:56Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T15:08:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Related to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14802\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/158688345","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6580#issuecomment-158688345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6580","id":158688345,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODY4ODM0NQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-21T22:41:33Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T22:41:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing in favour of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8939\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
