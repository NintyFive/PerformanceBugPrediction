I asked on irc and Warkholm stated that ES does not in fact recognize when this happens..\n\nI'm not sure where @markwalkom got that idea... aliases are reduced to a unique list of the corresponding indices\n\n```\nPUT t/t/1\n{}\n\nPUT t/_alias/x\nPUT t/_alias/y\n\nGET x,y/_validate/query?explain\n```\n\nreturns:\n\n```\n\"explanations\": [\n  {\n    \"index\": \"t\",\n    \"valid\": true,\n    \"explanation\": \"*:*\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nIt even knows how to combine filtered aliases on the same index correctly\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
