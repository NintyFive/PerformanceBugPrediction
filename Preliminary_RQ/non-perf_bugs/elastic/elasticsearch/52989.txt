I found that the buggy methods of the CVEs are in the program execution path of your project, which makes your project at risk. I have suggested some version updates. Details are listed below:\r\n\r\n1. **Vulnerable Dependency:** org.apache.hadoop : hadoop-common : 2.8.1\r\n\r\n* **Call Chain to Buggy Methods:**\r\n\r\n  * **Some files in your project call the library method org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.checkTGTAndReloginFromKeytab(), which can reach the buggy method of [CVE-2017-15713](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15713).**\r\n\r\n    * Files in your project: \r\n      plugins/repository-hdfs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/hdfs/HdfsSecurityContext.java\r\n    * One of the possible call chain:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.checkTGTAndReloginFromKeytab()\r\n    org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled()\r\n    org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.isAuthenticationMethodEnabled(org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation$AuthenticationMethod)\r\n    org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.ensureInitialized()\r\n    org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.initialize(org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration,boolean)\r\n    org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.get(java.lang.String)\r\n    org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.substituteVars(java.lang.String) [buggy method]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* **Update suggestion:** version 3.2.1\r\n  3.2.1 is a safe version without CVEs.
