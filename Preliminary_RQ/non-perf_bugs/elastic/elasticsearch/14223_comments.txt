Now that we merged both, we have to accept the `minimum_should_match` parameter in all cases and I think the bug is that we don't fail when `min_should_match` is set while we are in a `filter` context.\n\n`minimum_should_match` is currently deprecated so that we can make the `terms` query always generate a Lucene TermsQuery instead of a BooleanQuery when used in a query context, which I think is important for the predictability of the query DSL. Otherwise, queries would have very different performance characteristics when used as a filter or a query, would fail when there are more than 1024 clauses when used as a query and not a filter, etc. This will help remove the inconsistency as well when `minimum_should_match` is finally removed.\n\nI agree the bool syntax is a bit verbose, but I don't think that the terms query should be the solution. Maybe we can find ways to simplify the bool syntax when all sub queries are term queries.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/176903410","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14223#issuecomment-176903410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14223","id":176903410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjkwMzQxMA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-29T18:43:00Z","updated_at":"2016-01-29T18:43:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Min should match hasn't been documented in the terms query since 2.0.
