This happens when a few things line up:\r\n1. Some shards map the field that you are running the `range` on and some do not.\r\n2. You are querying enough shard to kick in the can_match phase (128).\r\n3. Your query matches no docs and we recognize this during the can_match phase.\r\n4. The shards that don't map the field for the `range` sort before those that do map the field for the range.\r\n\r\nAll of that causes us to run the \"Range.Unmapped\" special aggregator which mistakenly doesn't include its subAggs. I'll open a fix for it.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/717220059","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/64142#issuecomment-717220059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/64142","id":717220059,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzIyMDA1OQ==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T12:48:52Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T13:12:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's a bit simpler than that, I just discovered: all you need is for the date_range to target an index that doesn't map the target field. That'll get you the same results. `can_match` comes up on `demo.elastic.co` because it has lots of shards and it makes the results more confusing because, well, some shards *do* map that field so you'd expect not to use the unmapped implementation. But can_match kicks in here to help and we confuse it with a bad aggregator impl.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
