Putting all the trickiness of a distributed master election aside (it's not easy to add these things correctly),  the main thing to realize here that you need to have a good working master at any given moment. Otherwise your cluster is in a big risk. So have a slow master and a fast master doesn't make sense - you need two fast masters etc.\n\nPS. We try to keep github for concrete issues.
