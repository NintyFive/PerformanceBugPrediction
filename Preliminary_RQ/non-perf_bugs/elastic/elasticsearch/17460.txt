the `DiskThresholdDecider` is enabled, it will attempt to see how much disk\nspace is used _after_ a shard has been allocated to a node (to know whether it\nis over the high watermark).\n\nHowever, in the case that a shard is using a custom data_path setting, the\nshard's size _may_ not affect the amount of disk on the node's configured\n`path.data`.\n\nThis can lead to weird things like shadow replicas not being relocated within a\ncluster because all nodes think they don't have enough space for them, even\nthough they do because it's a different filesystem
