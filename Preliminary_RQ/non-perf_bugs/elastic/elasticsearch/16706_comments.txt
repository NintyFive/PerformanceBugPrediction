I used a default index template from https://github.com/joshuar/pingbeat and indeed, the `target_name` is `analyzed`. I reindexed and all is good now.\n\nI will open a ticket or send Joshua a pull request as I don't see the benefit in having a hostname analyzed. It does not look very good on a dashboard :-)\n\nA huge thank you for replying so quickly and helping me with this!\n\nCheers,\n\nMarco\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
