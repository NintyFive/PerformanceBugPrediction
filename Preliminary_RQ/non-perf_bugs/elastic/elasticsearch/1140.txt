Here is an example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"custom_filters_score\" : {\n        \"query\" : {\n            \"match_all\" : {}\n        },\n        \"filters\" : [\n            {\n                \"filter\" : { \"range\" : { \"age\" : {\"from\" : 0, \"to\" : 10} } },\n                \"script\" : \"_score * 3\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"filter\" : { \"range\" : { \"age\" : {\"from\" : 10, \"to\" : 20} } },\n                \"script\" : \"_score * 2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis can considerably simplify and increase performance for parameterized based scoring since filters are easily cached for faster performance, and the script is considerably simpler.\n\nThe query allows (on the same level as `query` and `filters`) to provide `boost`, and the common scripting elements `params` and `lang`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
