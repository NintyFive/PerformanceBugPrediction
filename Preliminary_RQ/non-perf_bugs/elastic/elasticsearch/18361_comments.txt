In fact, for field types other than `attachment`, we throw an exception if you try to add `copy_to` to a multi-field (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/15213).  This isn't something we can fix in mappings, without introducing a lot of complexity which is likely to carry bugs with it.  \n\nThe mapper-attachment plugin is deprecated in favour of the [ingest-attachment plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/master/ingest-attachment.html), so this is not something that we're going to fix, but I will remove the docs claiming that we support `copy_to`.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/219386393","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18361#issuecomment-219386393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18361","id":219386393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTM4NjM5Mw==","user":{"login":"sikron","id":2979076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzkwNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2979076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sikron","html_url":"https://github.com/sikron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sikron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sikron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sikron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sikron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sikron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sikron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sikron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sikron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sikron/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T09:35:11Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T09:35:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hi, thx for clarification!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
