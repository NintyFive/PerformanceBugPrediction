This is something that is being continually worked on, and some progress has been made starting with 5.5.  For this particular issue see (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/5.5/_operators.html#dot-operator).\r\n\r\nMore specifically:\r\n\r\n\"Method calls can be overloaded based on arity in Painless. The same method name can be re-used for different methods as long as the number of arguments differs. This differs from Java method overloading, where only the types must differ. This has an effect on some of the provided reference type methods in the Painless API. Where there are overloaded methods with the same arity for a reference type in Java, Painless chooses a single method to be provided.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done for both practical and performance implications.  The chosen method for remove in this case was remove(int).  Whether or not this was the correct decision is debatable, but the remove method you are expecting does not exist in Painless.  The API  available in Painless can be viewed here (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/5.5/painless-api-reference.html).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/320098835","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26035#issuecomment-320098835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26035","id":320098835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDA5ODgzNQ==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-03T21:45:44Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T21:45:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing as this is working as expected.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/320105145","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26035#issuecomment-320105145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26035","id":320105145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDEwNTE0NQ==","user":{"login":"StuAtGit","id":9757762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NTc3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9757762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StuAtGit","html_url":"https://github.com/StuAtGit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StuAtGit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StuAtGit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StuAtGit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StuAtGit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StuAtGit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StuAtGit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StuAtGit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StuAtGit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StuAtGit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-03T22:17:58Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T22:17:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the docs. For anyone else that stumbles into this issue, the quote above was from this link:\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/5.5/modules-scripting-painless-dispatch.html\r\nAnd it's useful.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I would say would be to add a \"Common Issues\" or \"Caveats\" set of examples to the examples section of the documentation. Along with warnings stated clearly, and at the beginning, with their consequences made clear, something like:\r\n\"Be aware that, while Java methods may be exposed in the painless language, that are not called in the same way. For more details see (link to the above quote). This means that you can get unexpected results when calling overloaded functions - the function you expect to be called may not be called.\"\r\n When you're trying to get something simple working quickly, like updating a list, an example is often helpful. As are warnings stated clearly upfront. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
