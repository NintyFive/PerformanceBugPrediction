The CentOS images are needed for us to continue publishing to Docker Hub (at least for the official images in /library). There is a [requirement](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#repeatability) (from Docker) that any official images are built on top of a Docker official base image. There isn't an official UBI image and neither Red Hat nor Docker intends to produce one at this time. Hope this helps.
