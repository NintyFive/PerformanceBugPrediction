For example, the [Snapshot and restore page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/modules-snapshots.html) says this:\r\n\r\n> The chunk size can be specified in bytes or by using size value notation, i.e. 1g, 10m, 5k.\r\n\r\nThe wording implies that if the value is just a number, it will be treated as bytes. Actually a number+unit is required, so to specify something in bytes, the user must input `1024B`.\r\n\r\nThis wording appears in multiple places: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/search?q=%22specified+in+bytes+or+by+using+size+value+notation%22&unscoped_q=%22specified+in+bytes+or+by+using+size+value+notation%22\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"wchrisdean","id":53786748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg2NzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/53786748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchrisdean","html_url":"https://github.com/wchrisdean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchrisdean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchrisdean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchrisdean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchrisdean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchrisdean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchrisdean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchrisdean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchrisdean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchrisdean/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
