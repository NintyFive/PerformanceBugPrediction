A separate PR will be opened by @gtback to develop an automated solution that reads through the ES configuration settings code and pulls tagged content for supported settings into a Cloud settings page.\r\n\r\nThis automated approach reduces maintenance overhead and ensures that we generate the full list of Cloud settings without having to manually build the page. When this automated solution is complete, we will build a complete list of Cloud settings, and also share the solution with the Kibana team so that they do the same.\r\n\r\ncc: @nrichers for visibility","performed_via_github_app":null}]
