Flush the heap buffer to FileChannel.\r\n2. Fsync the file contents to disk.\r\n3. Write checkpoint file and flush it to disk.\r\n\r\nFor durability against JVM crashes, which are more frequent than hardware crashes etc., flushing the heap buffers(both translog and checkpoint) to page cache is sufficient. Fsync is primarily needed for protection against hardware failures.\r\nBecause of the tight coupling between the above 3 steps, I cannot choose to have a per request sync to page cache and an asynchronous fsync to disk. Hence, I can either get durability against both types of crashes or none of them, even though the probability of both is different.\r\n\r\nI am proposing a new flush type that ensures the flushes to page cache and not to disk so that the guarantees are decoupled. The disk flushes can continue to happen asynchronously. Users can choose to use any of the flush depends depending on the durability requirements. \r\n\r\nSince time taken to write to page cache is negligible, we can gain significant indexing performance and reduce disk I/O costs without an impact to durability against more frequent JVM crashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
