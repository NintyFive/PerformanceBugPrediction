This was a super normal thing to do back in 1.x days but I believe we moved most of the parsing was moved to the coordinating node in 2.0. What we have now is a neat hack to keep things working but ultimately it isn't something we want to keep forever. And I think we've accidentally kept it for a long, long time now.\r\n\r\nSo, do we plan to retire these decay functions some day?
