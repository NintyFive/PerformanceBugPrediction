However, in 7.x it causes deprecation warnings and needs to be removed altogether.\r\n\r\nThe 6.x `DatafeedConfig` class looks like it has a design flaw where some parts of the code allow for the possibility of `null` `types` whereas other parts assume an empty list.  Therefore, in the BWC wire serialization of `DatafeedConfig`, `types` should be sent as an empty list to 6.x nodes rather than `null`.\r\n\r\nAll searches in the implementation of datafeeds that call `setTypes()` when building searches should no longer set any types.\r\n\r\nThere are also references to `types` in datafeed updates.  These need to be removed from 7.x too.","closed_by":{"login":"dimitris-athanasiou","id":9351617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTE2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9351617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitris-athanasiou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
