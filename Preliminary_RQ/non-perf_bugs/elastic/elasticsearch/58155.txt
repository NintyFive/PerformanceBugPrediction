Ideally the subphase would have these properties:\r\n1. It performs all mapping lookups once, for example resolving the source path for a field alias. It should not do this for every hit.\r\n2. If any other stored fields are loaded, like `_id`, then it loads the `_source` in the same 'visit stored fields' call, as opposed to loading it separately. Source filtering only makes one 'stored fields' call, and I've found in benchmarks that it makes a significant difference in timing (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55363#issuecomment-644441380).\r\n\r\nCurrently it is hard for a fetch subphase to do both. It could process all hits at once through `hitsExecute` in order to use some shared state (like mapping information) across hits. But then it has to make a separate 'stored fields' call per hit to load the _source.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if a fetch subphase could hold some state across hits, but also share loaded _source with other subphases. I think the same idea would benefit the 'scripted field' phase.","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
