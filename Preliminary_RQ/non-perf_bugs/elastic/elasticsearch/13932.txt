As an example of this:\n## Querying a non-indexed field\n\n```\nPUT trial\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"document_type1\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"prop1\": {\n          \"index\": \"no\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPOST trial/document_type1\n{\n  \"prop1\": \"sure\"\n}\n\nPOST trial/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"prop1\": \"sure\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis returns:\n\n```\n{\n   \"took\": 13,\n   \"timed_out\": false,\n   \"_shards\": {\n      \"total\": 5,\n      \"successful\": 5,\n      \"failed\": 0\n   },\n   \"hits\": {\n      \"total\": 0,\n      \"max_score\": null,\n      \"hits\": []\n   }\n}\n```\n## Querying a non-existing field\n\n```\nPOST trial/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"prop2\": \"some text\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis returns:\n\n```\n{\n   \"took\": 13,\n   \"timed_out\": false,\n   \"_shards\": {\n      \"total\": 5,\n      \"successful\": 5,\n      \"failed\": 0\n   },\n   \"hits\": {\n      \"total\": 0,\n      \"max_score\": null,\n      \"hits\": []\n   }\n}\n```\n\nBoth cases could return an exception, indicating that the field is not indexed, or does not exist. I've marked this issue as a discussion, since there are some cases such as querying multiple indices that could be a bit tricky to add consistency to the result of mixed results of existing fields on certain indices plus non-indexed/existing fields on other indices.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
