Unfortunately, it is a really hard one to fix in 1.x  A lot of the changes in 2.0 were about cleaning up this kind of stuff.\n\nWe wouldn't be able to fix this in 1.x without backporting half of 2.0, so I'm going to close this as won't fix.\n\nthanks for the good recreation\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
