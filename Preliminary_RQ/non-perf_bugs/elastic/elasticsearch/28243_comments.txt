We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. In particular, it is not detailed enough to be useful as a bug report: you do not say what Elasticsearch version you are using, and the \"steps to reproduce\" do not reproduce this problem on a clean installation of Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Please add a link to the forum discussion below so others can follow the thread. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
