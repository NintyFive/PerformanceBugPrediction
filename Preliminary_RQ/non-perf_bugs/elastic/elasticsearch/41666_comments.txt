Instead, it is being dynamically mapped as text, which causes mapping conflicts when a document contains both of these values.\r\n\r\nWe fixed a bug in #41871 that was preventing values of the form `2019-04-30T07:20:11.01` from being recognized as dates. This fix was released in 7.1.0, and I confirmed that the example above doesn't reproduce in 7.1.0 and later.\r\n\r\nI'll add ping the core infra team in case they have anything to add, and plan to close the issue shortly.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/494189963","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41666#issuecomment-494189963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41666","id":494189963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDE4OTk2Mw==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-20T23:55:17Z","updated_at":"2019-05-20T23:55:17Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra","performed_via_github_app":null}]
