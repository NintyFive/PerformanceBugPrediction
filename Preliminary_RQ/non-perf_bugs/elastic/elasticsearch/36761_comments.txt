taking a better look at the test and how the auto follow coordinator can work, I think that the underlying issue may be caused by a real issue in the auto follow coordinator. \r\n\r\nThe

In the test an auto follow pattern is added, a number of leader indices get created that should get auto followed, the auto follow pattern gets removed, the `logs-does-not-count` gets created (and should not get auto followed), then the auto follow patterns get re-added and finally a number of leader indices get created that should get auto followed.\r\n\r\nWhen the auto follow coordinator removes the auto follower, the auto follower itself doen't know it is deleted yet and may do another auto follow round before it really stops.
