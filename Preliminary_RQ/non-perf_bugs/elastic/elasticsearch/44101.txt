Create a dataset\r\n2. Create data frame transform\r\n3. Create destination index with conflicting mappings\r\n4. Start data frame transform\r\n5. Notice that it finishes without reporting any indexing failures in the `_stats` API, even though ES logs show 100% of the docs have failed to index.\r\n\r\n**Bug:**\r\nThere are 2 issues:\r\n\r\n- the indexer does not fail\r\n- the error count is wrong (we should count the bulk index failure as a whole, not the individual index failures)\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nThe error handling should use the same error handler that we use for search failures, meaning it should classify the issue into:\r\n\r\n- temporary failures (e.g. individual shard failures due to trouble on the node holding the shard)\r\n- irrecoverable failures (e.g. mapping conflict)\r\n\r\nTemporary failures shall be retried, irrecoverable failures will set the state to failed without retry.\r\n\r\nRetry will re-create/re-index the full page **as a whole** but not the individual index requests (which would be very complex).\r\n\r\n/cc @dolaru @sophiec20 \r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43194","closed_by":{"login":"benwtrent","id":4357155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTcxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4357155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent","html_url":"https://github.com/benwtrent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
