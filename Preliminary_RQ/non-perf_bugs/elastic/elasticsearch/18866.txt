Of course, this might not even be technically feasible due to the way Lucene segments are synced during a snapshot. But, I thought I'd ask anyway. I imagine it being an option for the repository (`allow_replicas` or something) which defaults to false. I understand that by enabling such an option, there's a risk that the snapshot process will be snapshotting out of date data. In our case, that risk is acceptable.\n\n**Background:** we run a pretty massive Elasticsearch cluster that is indexing 50k+ events per second (45mbp/s+), all day, every day. The problem is, we run frequent snapshots, and the burden this places on the primary shards can cause our indexing performance to suffer as a result. If the replicas could also be selected as candidates for the snapshot process then it would reduce this pressure.\n","closed_by":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
