My opinion is that this may not really be needed, since it controls internal behavior.\n\nFor clarification and background, I think the overall idea here is standardization of the placeholder naming. Looking at the [replacePropertyPlaceholders](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/settings/Settings.java#L1248-L1299) method, we actually have two different ways of ignoring placeholders, the `shouldIgnoreMissing` method and then a check against completely ignored values passed in to the method, which is a bit of a mess (that I introduced). \n\nThere is a reason for this mess. The prompt placeholders use the format `${prompt::text}`, which matches the format of other property placeholders. Where it differs is the use of `::` as a separator. The preexisting property placeholders use `:` to indicate there is a default value and `.` as a type of a prefix, such as `${env.foo}`. In order to support the `${prompt::text}` format, we cannot use the `shouldIgnoreMissing` method because the value would never be missing, it would always have a default value.\n\nIf we standardize the naming, then we can clean this up and at the same time remove the `replacePropertyPlaceholders` method from `Settings` since it is only useful when preparing the settings and doesn't need to be in that class.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/109305748","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11455#issuecomment-109305748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11455","id":109305748,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwOTMwNTc0OA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-05T14:14:13Z","updated_at":"2015-06-05T14:14:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wondering
