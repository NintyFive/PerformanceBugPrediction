version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): 6.5.0\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: none\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`): \r\n\r\njava version \"11\" 2018-09-25\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11+28)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11+28, mixed mode)\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\nReferencing stored scripts by id does not work inside watcher actions.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n1) Create a stored script\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"script\": {\r\n    \"lang\": \"mustache\",\r\n    \"source\": \"executed at {{ctx.execution_time}}\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2) Create a simple watcher with log action referencing this script:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"trigger\" : {\r\n    \"schedule\" : { \"interval\" : \"10s\" }\r\n  },\r\n  \"input\" : {\r\n    \"http\" : {\r\n      \"request\" : {\r\n        \"host\" : \"localhost\",\r\n        \"port\" : 9200,\r\n        \"path\" : \"/_cluster/health\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"actions\" : {\r\n  \"log\" : { \r\n    \"logging\" : {\r\n      \"text\" : {\r\n    \t \"id\" : \"log-action\"\r\n      }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn logs you will see:\r\n```\r\n[2019-03-19T17:11:06,919][INFO ][o.e.x.w.a.l.ExecutableLoggingAction] [eQ3F5fy] log-action\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-03-19T17:09:05,768][INFO ][o.e.x.w.a.l.ExecutableLoggingAction] [jR_IkMm] executed at 2019-03-19T16:09:05.739Z\r\n```\r\nThis is also reproducible for other actions, such as e-mail. \r\nThe issue is not repoducible in Elasticsearch version 6.4.\r\nThe cause of the issue is most likely the following PR https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/33978. \r\n\r\nIn particular, this fast path triggers\r\n```\r\nint indexStartMustacheExpression = template.indexOf(\"{{\");\r\nif (indexStartMustacheExpression == -1) {\r\n            return template;\r\n }\r\n```\r\nwhich treats `log-action` as a template.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
