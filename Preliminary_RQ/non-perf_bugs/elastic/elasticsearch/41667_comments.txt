But the error happens directly on the reindex request thread and not during a cluster state update task as indicated by above stack trace.\r\n\r\nI would imagine the above exception comes from the rollover. I have not been able to figure out how that could be triggered from reindex and hope you can give a hint on that?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
