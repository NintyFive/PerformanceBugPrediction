However I'm failing to think of a reason why it would be an advantage to have the value set inconsistent across nodes. This is a request to have it made a cluster level and dynamic setting.\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
