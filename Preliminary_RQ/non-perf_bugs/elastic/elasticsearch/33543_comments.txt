All dates are stored as epoch millis in UTC.\r\n\r\nInstead, this appears to be a user question, and we'd like to direct these kinds of things to the forums. If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/419757338","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33543#issuecomment-419757338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33543","id":419757338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTc1NzMzOA==","user":{"login":"veqryn","id":1897829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc4Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1897829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/veqryn","html_url":"https://github.com/veqryn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veqryn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veqryn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veqryn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veqryn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veqryn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veqryn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veqryn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veqryn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/veqryn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-10T00:37:35Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T00:37:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rjernst if this is not a bug, then I would like to make this a feature request that the next version of ElasticSearch have a date datatype that includes location information in it.\r\nFor space reasons it makes sense to keep a timestamp data type (the current date type) that is just a long integer normalized to UTC time, and then have a second data type that is location aware.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/421191014","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33543#issuecomment-421191014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33543","id":421191014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTE5MTAxNA==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T00:14:28Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T00:14:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@veqryn This would be a significant change to the date field type, and require a \"sidecar\" field (to keep the timezone info).

This is about how it is stored to allow searching in Lucene. Date fields are currently numeric fields (long values) and the codec in Lucene for long fields allows several optimizations over just using a binary term (eg range queries). In order to store the timezone along with a date, we would need a first class field type in Lucene which could still use the numeric structure, but store this extra information per document, within a single field. It would not be trivial.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly possible, but since it is trivial to store this information by a user in a separate field, and this does not appear to be a common need (this is the first I have seen anyone asking for it), I think our time is better spent elsewhere in the system. This is all open source, though, and if you find this feature to be important, you could start a discussion and work in Lucene.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
