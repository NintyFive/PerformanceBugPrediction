Moving forward to 1.1, 1.2 and so on, you won't need a full cluster restart. You might need it for 2.0 though as it's a major version that will most likely break backwards compatibility.\n\nAs for your question on tribe node, it uses the internal tranport layer to communicate with the different nodes, thus the same applies. You can mix different minor versions potentially, although not recommended since it's seen as a temporary solution while upgrading only. That wouldn't work with major versions (e.g. 0.90.x with 1.x).\n\nMay I ask you to send this type of questions to the mailing list the next time please as we tend to use github issues for bugs or feature requests?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
