issue is the result of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61016 and upgrading from a version that doesn't understand the voting only master role to one that does.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if we rolling-upgrade a cluster containing a voting only master node, we can get into a situation where if we upgrade the voting-only master first, the other nodes will potentially never pick up the role change unless the voting only master is restarted (since the voting only master will not send the voting_only role to old version masters when joining the cluster).\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem to have any side effects so far, other than breaking the fix for repository verification in #61016. The breakage comes because the voting_only master will stop creating repositories locally as is desired, but the actual master node will still continue to send it repository verification requests, leading to errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"repository_verification_exception\\\",\\\"reason\\\":\\\"[found-snapshots] [[xxxxx, 'RemoteTransportException[[tiebreaker-0000000002][xxxxx][internal:admin/repository/verify]]; nested: RepositoryMissingException[[found-snapshots] missing];']]\\\"}],\\\"type\\\":\\\"repository_verification_exception\\\",\\\"reason\\\":\\\"[found-snapshots] [[xxxxxxx, 'RemoteTransportException[[tiebreaker-0000000002][xxxx:xxxx][internal:admin/repository/verify]]; nested: RepositoryMissingException[[found-snapshots] missing];']]\\\"},\\\"status\\\":500}], headers: [List()], protocol: [HttpProtocol(HTTP/1.1)]\"}]\r\n````\r\n\r\nwhen running repository verification requests, even though the repository otherwise is functioning just fine.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
