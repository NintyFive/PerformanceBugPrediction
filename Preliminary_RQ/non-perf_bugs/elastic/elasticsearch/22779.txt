Recently I have been trying out Shield in an AWS environment. Since this is an elastic environment I was hoping to use our own wildcard SSL certificates as nodes were likely to come and go. During implementation I discovered that the only available settings for `network.host` are for AWS public/private hostnames/IPS which will never match against our certificates.  What would potentially solve this issue is by adding additional network host settings:\r\n\r\n_ec2:privatePtr_\r\n_ec2:publicPtr_\r\n\r\nThat way you could use reverse DNS to determine the full company hostname rather than the Amazon internal/public name. Our automations could then generate these Route53 entries during the launch of the instance.\r\n\r\nOr you could possibly just use tagging to achieve a similar result.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
