This problem is very hard to debug.\r\n\r\nWe should take into account the value of the `cluster.remote.connect` setting during node assignment.  A job whose associated datafeed uses cross cluster search should never be assigned to an ML node that has `cluster.remote.connect: false`.  If this means no suitable ML nodes exist in the cluster then this will result in an error message being generated that explains the problem - it will be clear that either the ML nodes must have CCS enabled on them or else datafeeds cannot use CCS.","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
