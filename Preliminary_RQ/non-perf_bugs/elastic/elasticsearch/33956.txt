This is bad, because all checks that we do in the follow index are bypassed and the follow index is no longer identical to the leader index.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent this situation, the shard follow tasks need to continuously check whether the follow shard is the same shard. I think the best way to do this is to record the history uuid of the follow shard when the shard follow task is started and the pass that down to the bulk shard operations api. In the bulk shard operations api we would then check if the provided history uuid is identical to the current history uuid and if not fail with an error that the shard follow task does not retry (e.g. IllegalStateException).\r\n\r\nNote that in #33954, we plan to no longer retry `IndexNotFoundException` exception and that should fail a shard follow task if it would replicate the documents into a follow shard. However that doesn't help in the case that a shard follow task is idle (because there are no documents to replicate), because when after the idle period, when the shard follow task starts to replicate, the underlying follow index could have been changed.","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
