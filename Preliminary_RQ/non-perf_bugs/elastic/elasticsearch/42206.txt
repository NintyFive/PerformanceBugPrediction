Most importantly, it does not retain `creation_date`, what causes that further ILM processing does not happen at originally planned time.\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/elastic/curator/issues/1347\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Create an ILM policy that will shrink an index in warm phase\r\n 2. Associate a policy to an existing index, which is old enough to trigger warm phase\r\n 3. Observe settings of shrunk index\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"GoodMirek","id":7804468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQ0Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7804468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodMirek","html_url":"https://github.com/GoodMirek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodMirek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodMirek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodMirek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodMirek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodMirek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodMirek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodMirek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodMirek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodMirek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
