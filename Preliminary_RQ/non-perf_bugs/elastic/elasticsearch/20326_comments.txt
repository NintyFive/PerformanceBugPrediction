The one that I noted above about not being able to control the logging level for Elasticsearch only, we've effectively equated `org.elasticsearch` with the root logger. The other is that it's impossible to control the log level for a single class within Elasticsearch, it's package-level only. This can be problematic for large packages, especially as we move to compress the number of packages. \n\n> But not so much in favor of it that I think it is worth spending a lot of time on.\n\nEither way, this would not be a time-consuming change at all. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/244991744","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20326#issuecomment-244991744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20326","id":244991744,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDk5MTc0NA==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T15:37:26Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T15:37:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The more I think about this, the more I'm becoming convinced that the two detriments I've pointed out outweigh the benefits of not having to type `org.elasticsearch` and that we should make this change.
