It is defined in POSIX¹.  If /bin/sh on Solaris doesn't accept this, it's because it's an ancient shell (not surprising, given how ancient most of the tools on Solaris are).  \n\nThat might still be a reason to use backticks, but it's incorrect to call this a bashism.  When working around old shells on systems like Solaris, it's worth noting that's the problem so the work around can be removed when those ancient systems are no longer supported.  (As I understand it, even Solaris has a proper posix sh, it just isn't always /bin/sh.)\n\n¹ http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_06_03\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
