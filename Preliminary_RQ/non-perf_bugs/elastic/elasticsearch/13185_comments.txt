E.g. increasing `index.merge.policy.segments_per_tier` and/or decreasing `index.merge.policy.max_merge_size` should give better indexing throughput, since it tolerates more segments in the index, but it risks exhausting file handles if the node stores many shards and the risk is very dependent on how large the shard turns out to be and whether compound file format was disabled.\n\nAlso, when users change from one profile to another (e.g. THROUGHPUT to SEARCH_PERFORMANCE) suddenly on large shards there could a long running high merging cost for the shard to \"catch up\" to the new settings.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/372874099","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13185#issuecomment-372874099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13185","id":372874099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjg3NDA5OQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-14T01:28:56Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T01:28:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We have stopped documenting these settings in #13199.
