The example that spurred this was dates. \n\nDates are stored in a variety of formats, but are always normalized into a long for indexing. However, when retrieving dates they come back as stringw that need to be parsed into the language's native date object, which requires knowing their format. Field data's normalized long could be parsed into a date object without needing to know the original source field's format.\n\nThe proposed feature would allow the user to specify that they want the field value to be retrieved from field data using the format: __fielddata.fieldname_, much like we support __source.fieldname_.\n\nEg:\n\n```\n{\n    \"query\": { \n        \"match_all\": {\n        }\n    },\n    \"fields\": [\"_fielddata.user.id\"]\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
