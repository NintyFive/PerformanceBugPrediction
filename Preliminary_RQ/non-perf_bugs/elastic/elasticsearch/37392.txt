When you apply this patch to branch [v6.x](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/6.x/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/search/SearchTransportService.java) in [this commit](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/761f4c12e27), you forgot change the execution thead_pool of search related action to the `SAME`.
