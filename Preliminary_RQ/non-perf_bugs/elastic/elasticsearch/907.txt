For example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"fuzzy\" : {\n        \"price\" : {\n            \"value\" : 12,\n            \"min_similarity\" : 2\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWill result in a range query between `10` and `14`. Same applies to dates, with support for time format for the `min_similarity` field:\n\n```\n{\n    \"fuzzy\" : {\n        \"created\" : {\n            \"value\" : \"2010-02-05T12:05:07\",\n            \"min_similarity\" : \"1d\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the mapping, numeric and date types now allow to configure a `fuzzy_factor` mapping value (defaults to 1), which will be used to multiply the fuzzy value by it when used in a `query_string` type query. For example, for dates, a fuzzy factor of \"1d\" will result in multiplying whatever fuzzy value provided in the `min_similarity` by it. Note, this is explicitly supported since `query_string` query only allowed for similarity valued between `0.0` and `1.0`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
