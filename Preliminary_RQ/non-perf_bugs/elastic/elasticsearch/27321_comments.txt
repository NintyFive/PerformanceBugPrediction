Every feature comes with weight added on the system. This one I suspect is being requested because it might have once helped debugging some problem (please clarify if my assumption here is wrong, I don't otherwise see a use to this except for debugging). We can not simply go add features every time something might have one time been useful, it has to have broader usefulness and in general not come with caveats, gotchas, or leniency (we will sometimes use the pejorative \"trappy\"). When we take a feature on, we carry the weight of the code (e.g., maintaining it), we carry the weight of documenting and supporting the feature, and carry the weight of not breaking its use cases (both the intended and unintended ones). The case has to be made then: is the benefit of the feature worth this weight? For this one I am not seeing it. It comes with caveats, and it's logging ephemeral information in a place where we do not normally log ephemeral information. It's trying to solve a problem (log messages might be gone) that is a much broader problem than this specific log message for which the general solution should absolutely not be shove log messages into metadata. Since this is not how we would solve the general problem, I think we shouldn't solve the specific problem here this way either, especially given the caveats about its use.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/343487157","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27321#issuecomment-343487157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27321","id":343487157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MzQ4NzE1Nw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-10T14:27:45Z","updated_at":"2017-11-10T14:27:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We discussed this in Fix-it-Friday and agreed that we should not add this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
