I run a series of configuration tasks to install java then configure elasticsearch and run it. The problem is when the batch script does not find JAVA_HOME it pauses instead of throwing an error and returning an exit code. Because of this I will assume that this batch script is geared towards people who intend to run elasticsearch manually. I propose a similar batch script elasticsearch-headless.bat which can be initiated by other  automated processes. \n\nI realize that there is a service.bat but I would lose too much control if I installed Elasticsearch as a service. The runtime needs to respond immediately if the process crashes for example. \n","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
