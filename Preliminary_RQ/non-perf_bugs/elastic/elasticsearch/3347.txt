In the example above, I index a parent type, \"folks\", and child types \"nice_kids\" and \"mean_kids.\" I put one document in each, a parent record (\"mom\") a nice_kids record (\"nice\") and a mean_kids record (\"mean\").\n\nSearching for \"mean\" in the nice_kids type (or vice versa) appropriately yields nothing. But a has_child query searching for query_string \"mean\" in the nice_kids type (or vice versa) returns the parent, if an alias is used.\n\nThe curl recreation should have the relevant details, but obviously please let me know if there's anything I left out.\n\nThanks for all the hard work,\n-Erik\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
