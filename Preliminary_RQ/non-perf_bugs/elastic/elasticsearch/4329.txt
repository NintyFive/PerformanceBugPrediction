Only really need queries, indexes, updates, bulk updates, and multi search.\n2.  Suggest requests would be nice as well but are not required.\n3.  Should be able to get full request body.\n4.  The request should have free form fields that I can add to the request so I can recognize requests more easily.  I'd put things in there like the ip that caused me to issue the request and the my own identifier for the request type.\n5.  The requests should have some unique identifier on them that lasts for the life of the request and won't be repeated soon.\n6.  I don't need to search this stuff though it might help.\n7.  Needs to return all queries running on the cluster.\n8.  I won't issue the command frequently but when I do I need it to be serviced even if the cluster is under heavy load.  In fact, that is when I'll need it the most.\n9.  This API is useful even without the ability to kill requests but, one day, killing would be nice.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
