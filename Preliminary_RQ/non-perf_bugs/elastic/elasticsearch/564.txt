Others require lower priority since they include large payloads (recovery, bulk), and the rest are, well, the rest.\n\nIntroduce connection pooling between one node and another, with `high`, `low`, and `med`. By default, `high` is set to 1, `med` is set to `7`, and low is set to `2`.\n\nThis mainly comes from the problem of sending big bulk requests on the same channel causing other messages to get delayed.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
