Amongst other(perhaps) things: Using POSTS for getting search results breaks this. And most of the (high-end) features are sadly only available under this premise.\n\nOne side effect of ES not respecting this separation is that it becomes very difficult to put a proxy that exposes the search part of the ES but protects the ES cluster from writes/updates. \n\nHere is a comparison (even if limited): No one would ever dream of an UPDATE statement in SQL to suddenly do what essentially a SELECT does. \n\nI am aware of comments like \"ES is like a DB .. you would never expose a DB so why expose ES to the outside world\". Instead of poking holes into this kind of faulty reasoning let me present a counter example. If some one would write a DB that provides an HTTP interface that respects the HTTP VERBS then I would not have any qualms in exposing it to the outside world. Wait a second there are data stores that actually do that today. \n\nI would encourage the ES team to seriously consider supporting a better HTTP API that allows reuse of things that make the HTTP ecosystem so great like proxies, http-caches etc. \n\nAnd yes you can do GETs with entity bodies in case query-string based API isn't expressive enough. \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
