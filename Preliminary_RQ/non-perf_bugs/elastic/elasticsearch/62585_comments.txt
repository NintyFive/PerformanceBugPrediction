However we don't apply this optimization to `wildcard` and `prefix` queries, only in `query_string`.\r\nSo I don't know what is the step to move from `wildcard(field, \"*\")` to `Like(Source(), Field(\"field\"), \"%\")` but for the search layer, we should be able to optimize the first case,  `wildcard(field, \"*\")`.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
