I was wondering if elastic team would consider an alternative and explicit way to register modules on class path such as a properties files in META-INF or programmatic registration or even giving elastic url(s)/streams for modules/plugins jars/resources so that elastic could load it with a separate class loader as normal. \nCurrently it is very locked down and inflexible that modules (and plugins) can only be loaded from home directory. When we deliver our application to third party for deployment and maintenance it is very odd, error prone and unsafe to deliver bunch of jars and property files to be placed in external directories making sure that during upgrades old stuff get removed and new stuff gets placed in proper directories where the deployers only expect WAR and context files\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
