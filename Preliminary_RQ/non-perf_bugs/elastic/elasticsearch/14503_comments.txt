One is that automatic publish address selection is just address section, does not select the port number: which could happen if someone binds to [::1]:9200 and 127.0.0.1:9201 (something running on the last one). So in this case, things are simply wrong.\n\nThe other is that publish can be manually specified for expert cases, so we have to be careful. Nik is going to look into fixing the code.\n\nAdditionally, going along the path of \"publish host is pretty confusing for most\", more ideas:\n- moving bind.host/publish.host to an expert setting of the docs:  \"network.host\" is preferred.\n- remove warnings about publish host autoselection (in 2.x/master only right now), as we don't want to encourage people specifying it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/153694887","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14503#issuecomment-153694887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14503","id":153694887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzY5NDg4Nw==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T11:39:18Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T11:39:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FYI we have a related build failure: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14513\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
