And perhaps Elasticsearch settings are overwriting things that are important for other services.\n\nSo we don't think we should do anything here.  The good news is that, if another service changes an important setting to a value that is incompatible with running Elasticsearch, we will refuse to start.  This makes it easy for the user to spot that there is a problem and to rectify it using (eg) the symbolic link workaround that you presented.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
