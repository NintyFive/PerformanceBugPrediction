Now we have `default` and `default_search` which, if set, overrides the `default` at search time.\n\nYou don't actually have to specify these analyzers - they are used as defaults. I've tested out various configurations and all seem to work as expected.  Could you provide a simple recreation (preferably with curl) that demonstrates the problem?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/201190189","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16699#issuecomment-201190189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16699","id":201190189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTE5MDE4OQ==","user":{"login":"xavierfacq","id":3774556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQ1NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3774556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfacq","html_url":"https://github.com/xavierfacq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfacq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfacq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfacq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfacq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfacq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfacq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfacq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfacq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xavierfacq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-25T07:55:41Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T07:55:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @clintongormley\n\nI tried to reproduce many times on a fresh new instance, but I can't have the problem again.
