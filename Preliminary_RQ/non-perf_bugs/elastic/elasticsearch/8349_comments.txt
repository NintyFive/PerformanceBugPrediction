Fortunately it doesn't change often, and when it does change, usually it doesn't change much. That said, you're moving from an old version of Lucene.  The only way around this issue is to reindex your data with the new ICU plugin.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/61795045","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8349#issuecomment-61795045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8349","id":61795045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzk1MDQ1","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-05T11:39:08Z","updated_at":"2014-11-05T11:39:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In this case, the change is probably due to the fact that ICU's zh-cn used to default to pinyin ordering (which is a massive ruleset sized in megabytes) and now its radical-stroke based instead.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/61922019","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8349#issuecomment-61922019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8349","id":61922019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTIyMDE5","user":{"login":"mashudong","id":3242209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDIyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3242209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashudong","html_url":"https://github.com/mashudong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashudong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashudong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashudong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashudong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashudong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashudong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashudong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashudong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashudong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-06T03:23:54Z","updated_at":"2014-11-06T03:23:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@clintongormley Thank you very much for your reply.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
