If an include or exclude statement contains a mix of regex (\"pattern\") and exact (\"values\") clauses then this would be a logical OR - a match on the regex clause OR the exact value clause would constitute a match.\n\n@clintongormley you may have some input on this?\n","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
