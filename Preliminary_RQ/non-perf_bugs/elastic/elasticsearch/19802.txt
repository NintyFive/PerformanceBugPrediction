The objective is to automatically _partially_ complete input in a form, and make the filling of forms much faster.\n\nFor example, let's consider the data [\"antibiotic\", \"antidepressant\", \"antidote\", \"circumstance\"]\nIf the user enters \"a\" in my IHM, I would like the completion-suggester to answer:\n<<< all matching suggestions start with \"anti\", some examples are \"antibiotic\" or \"antidepressant\" >>>\nThen the IHM may automatically replace \"a\" with \"anti\" so the user does not have to write all letters.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
