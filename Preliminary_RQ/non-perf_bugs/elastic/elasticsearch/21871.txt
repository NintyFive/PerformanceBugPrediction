Create NEW index\r\n1. Copy  (aka reindex) data from OLD to NEW\r\n1. Delete OLD index\r\n1. Make an alias/link from OLD index name to NEW index\r\n1. Do my stuff\r\n1. Delete OLD index alias\r\n1. Create OLD index\r\n1. Copy (aka reindex) data from NEW to OLD index.\r\n1. Delete OLD index.\r\n\r\n3-4 transition is a race cond. If app is heavily writing to index, you're out of luck. Your index will be constantly created, you won't be able to even make an alias.\r\n6-7 is a potential race condition.\r\n\r\nTo work around the problem, we need aliases to work with existing indexes. \r\nAlso, an index rename functionality should be implemented, so that entire 4-7 would not be needed.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
