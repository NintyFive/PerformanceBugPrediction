For now the temporary solution would be to use the low-level REST client to send the delete by query request. You can probably build the query and some of the request body through the current java API objects, then send the output over to Elasticsearch as a `byte[]`. Unfortunately the response has also to be parsed manually from a `byte[]`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/341083155","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26928#issuecomment-341083155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26928","id":341083155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTA4MzE1NQ==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-01T11:38:25Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T11:38:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We are setting our end goal as possibly feature parity with the Transport Client. It will take time though. That means that we do want to add support for delete by query, as well as many other API that Elasticsearch exposes. We are tracking API completeness of the high-level REST client as part of #27205 , hence I am closing this issue in favour of #27205 .","performed_via_github_app":null}]
