I will push a fix to `0.18` branch, but also to the `elasticsearch-cloud-aws` repo. I will release a version of the `elasticsearch-cloud-aws` in an hour or so, so you don't have to wait for the next 0.18 version to come out (you can just install it from there, which will be the place to install plugins from with `0.19`).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
