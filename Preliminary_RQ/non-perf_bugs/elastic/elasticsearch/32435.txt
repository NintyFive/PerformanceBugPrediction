As we move forward and consider different methods of authorization we should consider having a different backing that could be supported by policies to accomplish ABAC. This also will provide a way for customers that want to implement their own authorization service a way to do so; many large organizations have a single place where authorization rules are kept and there is a desire to be able to reach out to these to make the authorization decisions.","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
