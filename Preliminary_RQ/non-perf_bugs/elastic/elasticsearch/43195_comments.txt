The nodes seem to be freezing during the test, with fault detection of the 2 nodes noticing that the respective other is not responding. This does not look to be anything specific to this test, and rather indicates an infrastructure problem with the CI machines. Given that this is on the 7.1 branch, which is not receiving many updates anymore, makes it even more likely that this is unrelated to the actual code that's running (given that we had 2 reports on the same day, with no prior ones). I'm closing this out as I don't think there's anything we can investigate here w.r.t. the specific test failure.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
