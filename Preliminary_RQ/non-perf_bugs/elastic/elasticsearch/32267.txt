A.k.a Openshift Online or Google Kubernetes Engine. It's not possible to set vm.max_map_count due to lack of permissions using an init-container, unless you run your own kubernetes platform and allow privileged containers. \r\n\r\nAfter some investigation I found that you can use NIO instead of mmap:\r\n`index:\r\n  store:\r\n    type: niofs\r\n`\r\nI tried that but the boostrap checks still fired for the MaxMapCountCheck. I tried setting \"es.enforce.bootstrap.checks\" to false (not ideal) on the container, but it throws the exception:\r\norg.elasticsearch.bootstrap.StartupException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: [es.enforce.bootstrap.checks] must be [true] but was [false]\r\n\r\nLooking at the code the MaxMapCountCheck is hardwired in and the es.enforce.bootstrap.checks logic has some extra assumptions built in.\r\n\r\nIf using niofs should I expect this check to occur?\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal if I could just disable the specific MaxMapCountCheck.\r\n\r\nWilling to tackle a PR if necessary. There are probably several approaches.\r\n\r\nTrying to avoid the possibility of having to run a dedicated kubernetes platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
