Extending an Ajax framework to support JSON is a simple job.  And if not there, then you can do the transformation in an application layer between the browser and Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch shouldn't be exposed directly to users anyway.\n\nNobody else has show interest in this feature since this ticket was opened, so I'm going to close it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/64963166","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2618#issuecomment-64963166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2618","id":64963166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0OTYzMTY2","user":{"login":"roytmana","id":2524911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjQ5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2524911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana","html_url":"https://github.com/roytmana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-29T19:53:29Z","updated_at":"2014-11-29T19:53:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That's ok to close it but itbis not about supporting json of course it is supported it is aboit supporting post not only with query json as post body but as form encoded parameters similar to currently supported get. It should be trivial just by checking for content type of the post to decide whether it is body payload or encoded parameters - really a low hanging fruit making integration easier in many cases\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
