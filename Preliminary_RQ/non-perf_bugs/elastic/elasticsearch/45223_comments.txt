However, in reality I cannot:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.4.2\r\n$ docker run -it docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.4.2 \\\r\n  elasticsearch-setup-passwords -Ediscovery.type=single-node auto\r\nSets the passwords for reserved users\r\n\r\nNon-option arguments:\r\ncommand\r\n\r\nOption         Description\r\n------         -----------\r\n-h, --help     show help\r\n-s, --silent   show minimal output\r\n-v, --verbose  show verbose output\r\nERROR: E is not a recognized option\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom a quick glance at the code, some CLIs extend `EnvironmentAwareCommand`, and some do not. It would appear that simply refactoring environment variable handling won't be enough to make everything \"just work\" under Docker. Given which, do we want to proceed with this work? There's no point doing it without changing the CLI code, because any tools that don't support `-E` options would be broken if there were any ES options in a container's environment.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/557509943","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45223#issuecomment-557509943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45223","id":557509943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzUwOTk0Mw==","user":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-22T12:14:20Z","updated_at":"2019-11-24T23:31:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The `-E` needs to be after the subcommand\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto -Ehttp.host=this.is.not.valid\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalStateException: unable to determine default URL from settings, please use the -u option to explicitly provide the url\r\n\tat org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.esnative.tool.CommandLineHttpClient.getDefaultURL(CommandLineHttpClient.java:161)\r\n\tat org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.esnative.tool.SetupPasswordTool$SetupCommand.setupOptions(SetupPasswordTool.java:267)\r\n\tat org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.esnative.tool.SetupPasswordTool$AutoSetup.execute(SetupPasswordTool.java:128)\r\n\tat org.elasticsearch.cli.EnvironmentAwareCommand.execute(EnvironmentAwareCommand.java:86)\r\n\tat org.elasticsearch.cli.Command.mainWithoutErrorHandling(Command.java:124)\r\n\tat org.elasticsearch.cli.MultiCommand.execute(MultiCommand.java:77)\r\n\tat org.elasticsearch.cli.Command.mainWithoutErrorHandling(Command.java:124)\r\n\tat org.elasticsearch.cli.Command.main(Command.java:90)\r\n\tat org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.esnative.tool.SetupPasswordTool.main(SetupPasswordTool.java:107)\r\nCaused by: java.net.UnknownHostException: this.is.not.valid: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/558824749","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45223#issuecomment-558824749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45223","id":558824749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODgyNDc0OQ==","user":{"login":"pugnascotia","id":8696382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTYzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8696382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia","html_url":"https://github.com/pugnascotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T21:28:34Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T21:28:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @tvernum.
