This was surprising behavior to me because the `post_filter` applies to the collapsed search hits just fine and I did not see anything that said it wouldn't work. However I'm not 100% sure if this would be a bug or enhancement.\r\n\r\nWe use the `post_filter` for the typical faceted navigation use case and we wanted to leverage the new field `collapse` with `inner_hits` to add more variety to our search results. I guess a workaround would be to use a `top_hits` + `filter` aggregation to do the [field collapse](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/search-aggregations-metrics-top-hits-aggregation.html#_field_collapse_example)? Are there any significant performance differences between using the `top_hits` aggregation vs the new `collapse` functionality?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST test-index/test-type/1\r\n{\r\n  \"value\":1,\r\n  \"common\":1\r\n}\r\n\r\nPOST test-index/test-type/2\r\n{\r\n  \"value\":2,\r\n  \"common\":1\r\n}\r\n\r\nPOST test-index/test-type/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"collapse\": {\r\n    \"field\": \"common\",\r\n    \"inner_hits\": {\r\n      \"name\": \"common\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"post_filter\": {\r\n    \"term\": {\r\n      \"value\": 1\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the search result `inner_hits` contains both doc 1 and 2, but I'm expecting to see only doc 1 because the `post_filter` does not match doc 2.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
