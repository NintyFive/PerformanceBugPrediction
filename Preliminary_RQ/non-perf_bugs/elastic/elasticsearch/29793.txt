It is possible to enable or disable ML by editing only the `elasticsearch.yml`. I suspect this is true for some of the other X-Pack features. \r\n\r\nThe reason for questioning how this is documented, was recently raised by @joegallo. Making edits to `kibana.yml` causes an optimize step when Kibana restarts. This can take several minutes to complete and is resource intensive. The only reason to edit `kibana.yml` would be if you wanted to disable the ML UI for only this instance of Kibana.\r\n\r\nIf the administrator only needs to edit `elasticsearch.yml` (which disabled the UI and the back-end) then we should let them know this.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"debadair","id":362578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjU3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/362578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair","html_url":"https://github.com/debadair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
