You have to add this dependency separately. I agree this is confusing developers (there are more confusing things when it comes to shading dependencies into the ES jar and to the optional jars). I assume this is just because ES deployments can be upgraded to a fix version of Lucene without the release of a new ES version.\n\nOf course, you can build your own version of ES, adding Lucene into the shaded jar. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/17216217","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2950#issuecomment-17216217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2950","id":17216217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjE2MjE3","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-30T08:54:29Z","updated_at":"2013-04-30T08:54:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"how can you build something with ES and not have the lucene core jar?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/17242734","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2950#issuecomment-17242734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2950","id":17242734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjQyNzM0","user":{"login":"ash211","id":357170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzE3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/357170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211","html_url":"https://github.com/ash211","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ash211/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-30T17:45:44Z","updated_at":"2013-04-30T17:45:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is a little confusing because the elasticsearch 0.20 used to be all we needed to use ES in a Java application, but now in 0.90 there are other dependencies that must be included.  I guess we never realized that there were other dependencies, since the ES jar seemed to be intended as a standalone mega-jar.  A couple questions then:\n\n1) Are there other dependencies that need to be included besides lucene-core?  The full list of dependencies in the [0.90 pom.xml](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/0.90.0/elasticsearch-0.90.0.pom)?\n2) The Java API seems to be less frequently used than the REST API in all the examples.  I don't think it's a problem to depend on the Java API since the REST API is built atop the Java API, but are there other gotchas we should know about?\n3) Is there a good place to add documentation on building projects using the Java API?  [This page](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/java-api/) is probably the best spot.  Maybe these are just things I would know if I was more immersed in the pom ecosystem.\n\nRegardless, thanks for the help @jprante and @s1monw , good to learn from the experts!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
