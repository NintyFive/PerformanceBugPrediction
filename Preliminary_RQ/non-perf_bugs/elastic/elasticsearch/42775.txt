While @rjernst and I were working on #42771 we found a number of issues with our current usages and customizations around this plugin, mainly around the introduction of the `bundle` configuration and confusing nature of the included `shadow` configuration. Among these problems is that we weren't generating accurate POM files for fatjars.\r\n\r\nWe should go back and revisit all this custom logic in our plugins that is conditional on the presence of the Shadow plugin. It's likely we are making incorrect assumptions here or adding unnecessary logic that has become OBE due to recent changes in Gradle core and the Shadow plugin itself.","closed_by":{"login":"mark-vieira","id":4106672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4106672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-vieira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
