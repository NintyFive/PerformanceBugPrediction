search and especially aggregations will only work on either the new or the old version, but there is a transition period where not all data will be seen.\r\n\r\nWe can introduce a new field type called `alias` which simply points to another field, eg:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT my_index\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"my_type\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"host\": {\r\n          \"properties\": {\r\n            \"source_ip\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"ip\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"sourceIP\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"alias\",\r\n          \"path\": \"host.source_ip\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis field type would work as follows:\r\n\r\n* Attempts to index into the alias field would result in an exception - it is read only\r\n* Queries, aggs, suggestions, scripts (using `doc[]`), highlighting, fielddata_fields, docvalue_fields, stored_fields would just get the data (and mapping) from the specified path\r\n* Source filtering would not work with the aliased field\r\n\r\nThis also works for users who want to expose a nicer name for fields in Kibana","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
