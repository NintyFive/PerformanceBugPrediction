Install gradle 2.14\n2. Checkout `master`\n3. Run `gradle build`\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n\n``` sh\nelasticsearch [master] $ gradle build\n:buildSrc:clean\n:buildSrc:compileJava\n:buildSrc:compileGroovy\nstartup failed:\n/Users/spalger/dev/es/elasticsearch/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/com/carrotsearch/gradle/junit4/TestProgressLogger.groovy: 28: unable to resolve class org.gradle.logging.ProgressLogger\n @ line 28, column 1.\n   import org.gradle.logging.ProgressLogger\n   ^\n\n/Users/spalger/dev/es/elasticsearch/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/org/elasticsearch/gradle/vagrant/TapLoggerOutputStream.groovy: 25: unable to resolve class org.gradle.logging.ProgressLogger\n @ line 25, column 1.\n   import org.gradle.logging.ProgressLogger\n   ^\n\n/Users/spalger/dev/es/elasticsearch/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/org/elasticsearch/gradle/vagrant/VagrantLoggerOutputStream.groovy: 23: unable to resolve class org.gradle.logging.ProgressLogger\n @ line 23, column 1.\n   import org.gradle.logging.ProgressLogger\n   ^\n\n3 errors\n\n:buildSrc:compileGroovy FAILED\n\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\n\n* What went wrong:\nExecution failed for task ':compileGroovy'.\n> Compilation failed; see the compiler error output for details.\n\n* Try:\nRun with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
