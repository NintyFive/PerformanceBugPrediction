As I described above, the primaries move around if I change the number of replicas.  Thus, feels like a bug to me.  In addition, if the primaries can, in fact, move as I've demonstrated, it'd be great to be able to assign them via command.  The \"exception\" case for updates makes this a very desirable feature if it's not a bug and, as I said, I've discovered I'm far from the only one struggling with this issue (eg. #12279, #29436, and many others in the discussion forums).  Feature or bug, this seemed quite the appropriate place for this report and\\or discussion of workaround.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/380003518","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29437#issuecomment-380003518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29437","id":380003518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDAwMzUxOA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T07:33:47Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T07:33:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-distributed","performed_via_github_app":null}]
