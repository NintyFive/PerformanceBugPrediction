is great, but would it be possible to specify a different pattern than just \"{index}-alias\" in the alias name? I have a use case where I have an index per day with the date after it:  \"index_name_20140306\" and I want to add it to an alias \"index_name\" to group them all together for searching.\n\nCan we make the alias name a script field so we can use mvel to calculate the alias name? Or perhaps add more things we can use like the value of a field defined on a template's mapping? \"{field.path}\" perhaps similar to how we can define routing by the value of a field? \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/36849786","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1825#issuecomment-36849786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1825","id":36849786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODQ5Nzg2","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-06T12:00:44Z","updated_at":"2014-03-06T12:00:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @rbraley we had the same discussion in #5180 and decided to merge the PR in as is since we didn't reach a consensus on how to support what you (and other users too) are asking for.
