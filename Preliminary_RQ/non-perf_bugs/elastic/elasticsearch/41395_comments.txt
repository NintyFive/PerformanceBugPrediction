Our feeling is that there is value in having tests on the `docker-compose.yml` files, just to make sure they do what they're supposed to do in the happy path.  However, we felt that adding complex scenarios to catch errors we've already seen has rapidly diminishing returns. Something like a restart test here feels like an expensive regression test, which we didn't think added much value.  If there were a proposal for a test that would catch a class of errors, and not just one specific error we already encountered, that would be worth looking into, but tests that catch single, known issues doesn't provide enough utility for how fragile/expensive it would be.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/488652343","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41395#issuecomment-488652343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41395","id":488652343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODY1MjM0Mw==","user":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-02T12:25:12Z","updated_at":"2019-05-02T12:25:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing per the above comment, @DaveCTurner please reopen if you think this needs more consideration.
