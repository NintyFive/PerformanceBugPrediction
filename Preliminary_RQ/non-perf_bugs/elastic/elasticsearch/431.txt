The json provided to the script is under a var called `ctx` with the relevant seq stream change (for example, `ctx.doc` will refer to the document, or `ctx.deleted` is the flag if its deleted or not).\n\nNote, this feature requires the `lang-javascript` plugin.\n\nThe `ctx.doc` can be changed and its value can will be indexed (assuming its not a deleted change). Also, if `ctx.ignore` is set to `true`, that change seq will be ignore and not applied.\n\nHere is an example setting that adds `field1` with value `value1` to all docs.\n\n```\n{\n    \"type\" : \"couchdb\",\n    \"couchdb\" : {\n        \"script\" : \"ctx.doc.field1 = 'value1'\"\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
