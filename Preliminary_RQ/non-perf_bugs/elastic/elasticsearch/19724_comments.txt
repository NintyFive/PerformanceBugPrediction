I do not think there is a bug in Elasticsearch and I do not think it is worth trying to safeguard against this in the 2.x series. Note that the suggestion to copy isn't even safe, because someone could still concurrently modify system properties while the copy is taking place. The only safe fix is to synchronize the reading of system properties with anyone else that might be setting system properties. I think that this can also arise if your test runner modifies system properties, or if you're doing something like invoking `TimeZone#setDefaultZone` or any other method like that that indirectly modifies a system property. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
