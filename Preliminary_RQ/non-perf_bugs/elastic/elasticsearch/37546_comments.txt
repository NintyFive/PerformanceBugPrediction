Bulk indexing does best effort, indexing all docs that can go in and returning errors for those that conflict.\r\n\r\nIf you did not specify \"conflicts\": \"proceed\" reindex will then terminate afterwards. But all docs in the last batch will have been attempted indexed.\r\n\r\nIf you agree that this explains what you saw maybe we can move to closing this issue?
