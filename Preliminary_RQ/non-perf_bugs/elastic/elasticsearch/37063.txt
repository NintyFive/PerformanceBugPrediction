If `securityClient.prepareInvalidateToken(\"fooobar\")` fails in an unexpected way then that exception will occur inside the `assertBusy` and not stop the test, but it might mean that the token removed was never started. I don't see any evidence of that in the logs though.\r\n2. Due to clock/DST changes, etc. It's possible that setting the token's creation time back by 1 day isn't enough to trigger its deletion (The remover looks for tokens that are 24h old). Setting it back 36 hours would be more reliable.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jkakavas","id":10281256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgxMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10281256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas","html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
