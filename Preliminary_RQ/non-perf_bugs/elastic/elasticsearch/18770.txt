Add an environment variable called JAVA_HOME, and set D:\\Java7u71\\jdk.\n2. Set %JAVA_HOME%\\bin in the PATH variable\n3. Go to the directory path of where the elasticsearch folder is. And run the following command: ./bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/marvel/latest [This is from the \"Get Started\" video]\n   1. I see the following error: ./bin/plugin: line 113: D:Java7u71jdk/bin/java: No such file or directory\n   2.

I am following the video from the link: https://info.elastic.co/2016-03-AB-Test-Getting-Started-ES_Video.html?aliId=43138086 and I am currently running into an issue where the elasticsearch plugin is not properly getting the environment variable name correctly where it is removing all the blackslash. D:\\Java7u71\\jdk\\bin. I would like to also note that the command to install the plugin no longer works and feels like there should have been some kind of comments left below the video or something.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
