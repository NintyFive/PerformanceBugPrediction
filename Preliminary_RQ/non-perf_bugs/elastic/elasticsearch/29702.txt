Sometimes even admins have to be blocked from running it, and only allow super/smarter admins to run it.  With the move to high level privileges, force merge action is now part of a broader manage privilege at the index level.  Perhaps we can create force_merge privilege and remove it from the generic manage privilege so that they have to grant it explicitly for specific users?\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"albertzaharovits","id":4568420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njg0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4568420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits","html_url":"https://github.com/albertzaharovits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
