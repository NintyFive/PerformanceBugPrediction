I turned on debug logging and while I couldn't find a more specific reason this fails I noticed it made ~ 2K requests to S3 until it failed and it stopped at 90 seconds. Is this a configurable timeout?\r\n\r\nIn the past getting a list of snapshots took increasingly long but it eventually responded.
