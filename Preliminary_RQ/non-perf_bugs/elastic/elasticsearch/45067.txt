It would be great if we could add functionality similar with this by combining parts of the SLM and ILM features in ES.\r\n\r\nFor example, if an index had a policy like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"policy\": {\r\n    \"phases\": {\r\n      \"delete\": {\r\n        \"min_age\": \"15d\",\r\n        \"actions\": {\r\n          \"snapshot\": {\r\n            \"policy\": \"my-slm-policy\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"delete\": {}\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nILM would wait until the index entered the delete phase, it would then *wait* until a snapshot from the `my-slm-policy` SLM policy had been taken (it would *not* manually kick off a snapshot, since that could potentially create scores of unwanted snapshots), and then it would delete the index.\r\n\r\n/cc @yaronp68 as you asked me to open an issue for this.","closed_by":{"login":"probakowski","id":3896475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTY0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3896475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski","html_url":"https://github.com/probakowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
