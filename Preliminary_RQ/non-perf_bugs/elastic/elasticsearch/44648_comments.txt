If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nAs such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/513526630","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44648#issuecomment-513526630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44648","id":513526630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzUyNjYzMA==","user":{"login":"SoftCreatR","id":81188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/81188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoftCreatR","html_url":"https://github.com/SoftCreatR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoftCreatR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoftCreatR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoftCreatR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoftCreatR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoftCreatR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoftCreatR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoftCreatR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoftCreatR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SoftCreatR/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-21T06:26:12Z","updated_at":"2019-07-21T06:26:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just did that and i guess, i found the solution (at least, for me): https://discuss.elastic.co/t/cannot-install-v6-on-buster/191505\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
