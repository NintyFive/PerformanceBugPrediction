This would mean inheriting all the settings and mappings. Although, it should not inherit the aliases.\r\n\r\nOne way of solving this is to change the behavior and keep the new behavior behind a backwards-compatible query-param (maybe called `copy_existing`) that defaults to `false`.\r\n\r\nthis flag would be:\r\n- 6.x: log a deprecation warning when using shrink without `copy_existing` setting explicitly configured to `true`. Configuring it to `false` is not allowed.\r\n- 7.0: defaulted to `true`, still disallowed to be `false`, and deprecated\r\n- removed in 8.0","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
