creating a custom aggregation for ML, the current [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/ml-configuring-aggregation.html) specifies that it the datafeed aggregation must start with the `buckets` date histogram as the top level aggregation with the terms aggregation as a 2nd level aggregation.\r\n\r\nFor the use case of doing a top-N aggregation with a derivative as the sub aggregation, we will actually have to create an aggregation with the terms agg being the top level aggregation, i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"aggs\": {\r\n    \"<terms_agg_name>\": {\r\n      \"terms\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"<field_name>\",\r\n        \"size\": 10\r\n      },\r\n      \"aggs\": {\r\n        \"buckets\": {\r\n          \"date_histogram\": {\r\n            \"field\": \"@timestamp\",\r\n            \"interval\": \"5m\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"aggs\": {\r\n            \"timestamp\": {\r\n              \"max\": {\r\n                \"field\": \"@timestamp\"\r\n              }\r\n            },\r\n            \"sum\": {\r\n              \"sum\": {\r\n                \"field\": \"<field>\"\r\n              }\r\n            },\r\n            \"derivative_sum\": {\r\n              \"derivative\": {\r\n                \"buckets_path\": [\r\n                  \"sum\"\r\n                ],\r\n                \"gap_policy\": \"skip\"\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n     ...\r\n     ... so on\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will be helpful to update the documentation with this use case and any other use cases where the `buckets` aggregation does not
