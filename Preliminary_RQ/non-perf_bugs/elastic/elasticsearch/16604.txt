I'm indexing documents (PDF or Word) in french using the excellent plugin \"mapper-attachment\". We are using elastic-search version 2.7 and have installed the plugin corresponding to the right version (at least I hope)\nThe plugin has been installed like that: sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/2.7.0\nEverything works fine except for words with quotes. In french we need to separate words using quotes for exemple \" the attention \" is translated as \" l'attention \". When I index an attachment having the words \" l'attention \" and when I search for \"attention\", it doesn't match.\nWhen I index a regular String using the same analyzer it works fine. \" l'attention \" matches with \"attention\". The french elision filter works fine on regular Strings but not on attachment.\nI hope someone will be able to help me.\nIf needed I can provide you a testcase that shows exactly the problem.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
