working with elasticsearch and 1st, it's an amazing tool, 2nd I would suggest something about histogram aggregation with extended bounds.\nExtended bounds is a good idea but it could be fine if we can force the bounds with, say, a boolean or another method...\n\nFor instance:\nI have these data : [100,101,102,103,104]\nI'd like to create an histogram with an interval of 3.\n\nElasticsearch will produce : \n[ [99,doc_count:2] , [102,doc_count:3] ]\nThe problem is first tick always start from 0 but if I want to start my bucket from 100, I can't...\n\nThen I can't obtain : \n[ [100,doc_count:3] , [103,doc_count:2] ]\n\n(The only solution is to perform a script on each data which will shift my data in the right bucket... then : creepy performances)\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
