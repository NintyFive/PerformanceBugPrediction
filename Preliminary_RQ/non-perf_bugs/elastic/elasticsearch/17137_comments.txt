With logging, you typically generate the index name from the timestamp of the log message, so yes, you do index directly into the index for that month, rather than into an alias.\n\nAliases with logging make sense for read requests, where you want to query the latest index, or the most recent three months etc. \n\nThat said, we have an idea for a more flexible append-only work flow.  We'll be opening an issue to discuss this feature in the near future.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/197672824","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17137#issuecomment-197672824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17137","id":197672824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzY3MjgyNA==","user":{"login":"xmudall","id":3014901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3014901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall","html_url":"https://github.com/xmudall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T03:13:30Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T03:39:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @clintongormley \nI agree with your opinion on logging. I just used logging case as an example for easy understanding. Actually, I have a mail server provides full text searching on mails for users. I split mails by time slot (e.g. per month) to reduce resource usage especially memory (little fielddata, cache, etc.) . I use dynamic template to create index for every time slot. I hope all write/read operation is based on alias so that i can do a zero-downtime reindex if needed. That's why i have this problem.\nCould you please give me any suggestions how to achieve the requirement without an alias based template? Thanks a lot.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/199167186","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17137#issuecomment-199167186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17137","id":199167186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTE2NzE4Ng==","user":{"login":"xmudall","id":3014901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3014901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall","html_url":"https://github.com/xmudall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xmudall/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-21T08:13:01Z","updated_at":"2016-03-21T08:13:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @clintongormley \nAre you there?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
