ignore the parameter and treat as if nothing was sent\n    2 -  treat the empty string as the preference parameter\n    3 - return a friendly error message for it\n\nanyway, the error happens here (https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/routing/operation/plain/PlainOperationRouting.java#L172)\nand it could be easily fixed by either making a check for an empty string before comparing its first character, or changing this line https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/routing/operation/plain/PlainOperationRouting.java#L164 for something like preference.isEmpty(), which also covers the empty string case.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
