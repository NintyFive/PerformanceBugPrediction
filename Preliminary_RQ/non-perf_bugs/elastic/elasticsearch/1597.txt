Also, add specific flags to get only specific stats, by default, returning `indices` stats. The flags are: `indices`, `os`, `process`, `jvm`, `network`, `transport`, and `http`. `clear` can be used to clear all flags and then only apply the ones provided. For example: `_nodes/stats?clear=true&os=true&process=true`.\n\nSpecific REST paths are provided for each stats type, for example: `/_node/stats/process`, and `/_node/{nodeId}/stats/process`. \n\nAs usual, nodeId can be a list of node ids, or a list of IPs, hostnames, or attribute matching, all supporting wildcards.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
