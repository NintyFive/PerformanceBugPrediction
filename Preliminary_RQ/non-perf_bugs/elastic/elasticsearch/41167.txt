It was working great in version 6.4, now t not even picking up the field (returning null) while the field is there and I verified it by using expression.\r\nRegards,\r\nHAK\r\n<!-- Bug report -->\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): 6.7.0\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\nPainless is not getting an existing field from the index while same example doc['filed'].value is working fine on 6.4.
