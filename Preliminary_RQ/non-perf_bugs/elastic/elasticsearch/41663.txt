Bug Report:\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** 7.0.0\r\n**Plugins installed**: []\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`):\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system):\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nThe [docs note](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/02ef53c8533fdb08c5db7af3f2d8ffd5bbe6da67/docs/reference/settings/security-settings.asciidoc) that to use a truststore paired with `active_directory` authentication realm, you should use the configuration suffix `ssl.truststore.password`, but this errors with `unknown setting [xpack.security.authc.realms.active_directory.myrealm.ssl.truststore.password]`\r\n\r\nInstead, inspection of the code, and testing, shows that the property looked for is `truststore.password`, as can be seen at https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/core/ssl/SSLConfigurationSettings.java#L119:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static final Function<String, Setting.AffixSetting<SecureString>> LEGACY_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD_REALM = realmType ->\r\n            Setting.affixKeySetting(\"xpack.security.authc.realms.\" + realmType + \".\", \"truststore.password\",\r\n                    LEGACY_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD_TEMPLATE);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe corresponding `ssl.truststore.path` can be seen to use the ssl prefix in the code (line 107):\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static final Function<String, Setting.AffixSetting<Optional<String>>> TRUST_STORE_PATH_REALM = realmType ->\r\n            Setting.affixKeySetting(\"xpack.security.authc.realms.\" + realmType + \".\", \"ssl.truststore.path\", TRUST_STORE_PATH_TEMPLATE);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Configure an active_directory realm with a truststore + password, as detailed using the documentation properties\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nxpack.security.authc.realms.active_directory.myrealm:\r\n  ssl:\r\n    verification_mode: full\r\n    truststore:\r\n      path: certs/cacerts.jks\r\n      password: changeit\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Where as currently, 7.0.0 requires this setup instead (contradictory to the docs), but then there is an error loading the keystore (password verification failed), which i can only assume is because the password is not being picked up - manual keytool verification works)\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nxpack.security.authc.realms.active_directory.myrealm:\r\n  ssl:\r\n    verification_mode: full\r\n    truststore:\r\n      path: certs/cacerts.jks\r\n  truststore:\r\n    password: changeit\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
