not sure why using that API internally would be a reason to not separate the jars.  \n\nmany libraries ship their code in multiple jars.  once you add the new jar to your classpath everything will work as before.\n\nthen a client application can add a jar of ~100kb instead of 11mb.\n\nan even better approach would be to extract all the API into interfaces (which is probably already set up that way), and add a jar named elasticsearch-api-x.y.z.jar for applications that need to interact with ES without caring about implementation details.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/292766080","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2360#issuecomment-292766080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2360","id":292766080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Mjc2NjA4MA==","user":{"login":"MingleiLee","id":10842104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQyMTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10842104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MingleiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/MingleiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MingleiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MingleiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MingleiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MingleiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MingleiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MingleiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MingleiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MingleiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MingleiLee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-09T05:55:43Z","updated_at":"2017-04-09T05:58:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
