An early (unreleased) implementation of our logout code used POST because we already had the signature checking code for POST, but we switched to Redirect to conform with the interop profile.\r\n\r\nHowever, we've started to see one popular IdP send `LogoutResponse` messages using the `HTTP-POST` binding, and we already have most of the necessary code for handing `HTTP-POST` so we probably can support it in addition to the (preferred) `HTTP-Redirect` binding.\r\n\r\nNote: This will require a change in Kibana as well, because the Kibana `/logout` route currently only supports `GET` .\r\n\r\nRelates: #40901","closed_by":{"login":"ywangd","id":2344308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDQzMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2344308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd","html_url":"https://github.com/ywangd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
