Thank you so much!\r\n\r\nShould someone else stumble across this issue before the next patch release, here's a client-side workaround if you're not wanting to patch the server directly. The bug is that when a \"from\" date (via `gt` or `gte`) is specified, a \"to\" date (via `lt` or `lte`) is erroneously expected as well. We can work around by attaching an `lte` range check with a large value exceeding all your real date values. The year 9999 seems to work even with strict date formats. Thus, as an example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"range\": {\r\n      \"created\": {\r\n        \"gte\": \"2016-01-01\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan be worked around with:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"range\": {\r\n      \"created\": {\r\n        \"gte\": \"2016-01-01\",\r\n        \"lte\": \"9999-12-31\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null}]
