It was added to speed up `exists` query but now that doc values are iterable we don't need this extra field for this kind of query and we can save the cost at indexing time.  If you need to access all fields in a document you can implement your own `field_names` field and populate it with the key present in the json document.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
