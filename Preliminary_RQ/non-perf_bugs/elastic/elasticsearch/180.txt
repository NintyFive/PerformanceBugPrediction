There is a restriction for number of buckets though, so creating a bucket for metadata, and 2 buckets per shard does not make sense.\n\nEverything should be stored under the same bucket. With the option, on the index leve, to store it on a different bucket if configured.\n\nSadly, this breaks backward... . So a reindex should be done.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
