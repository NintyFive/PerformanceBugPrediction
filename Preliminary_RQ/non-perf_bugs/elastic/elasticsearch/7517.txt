DailyRollingFileAppender keeps creating files and has no limit on the # of files created.  \n\nSeems like it will benefit admins if we implement the default logging appenders to use **rollingFile** (org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender) with sensible defaults for **MaxBackupIndex** and **MaxBackupIndex** parameters (so that there is a cap on the # and size of log files created). And admins can adjust them based on their preference.\n\nOr if we desire daily logs, use a custom DRFA with MaxBackupIndex option?\nhttp://wiki.apache.org/logging-log4j/DailyRollingFileAppender\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
