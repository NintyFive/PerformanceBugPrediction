In other words, a datafeed would work fine on the `date_nanos` type providing every timestamp was an exact number of milliseconds since the epoch, i.e. nanoseconds since the epoch was a multiple of 1000000.\r\n\r\n#51180 fixes the case of a fractional number of milliseconds since the epoch.  (And note that the smallest possible ML `bucket_span` remains 1 second, and anomaly detection will still operate on summary statistics at the bucket level regardless of the underlying timestamp accuracy.)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/604957839","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49889#issuecomment-604957839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49889","id":604957839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDk1NzgzOQ==","user":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-27T11:48:58Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T11:48:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I believe this is fixed in 7.7 and above by https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/59017","performed_via_github_app":null}]
