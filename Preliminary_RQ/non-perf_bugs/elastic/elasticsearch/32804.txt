This can lead to users getting into problems such as [1]  where they forget to, or don't realise they need to, provide a `combine_script` and/or `reduce_script` causing weird looking results in the response. I can't think of a reason why you would not want a `combine_Script` and/or `reduce_script` so I think we should make both of these mandatory. If someone does have a use-case where they don't need one of these scripts, it should be trivial to write a script that passes the input state straight to the return value.\r\n\r\nI think the `init_script` should remain optional however, since I can see use cases where no set up is required before collecting documents.\r\n\r\nIn terms of bwc I think we will just need to add a deprecation warning if the scripted_metric agg is supplied without a `combine_script` and/or `reduce_script` warning the user that these scripts will be required in the next major version.\r\n\r\n[1] https://discuss.elastic.co/t/scripted-metric-aggregations-sorting/143719/4","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
