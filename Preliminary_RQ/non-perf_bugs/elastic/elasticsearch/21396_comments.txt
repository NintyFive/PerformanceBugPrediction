Because your shards might contain different distributions of documents with different sizes, you should expect to see some variation in disk usage from this method of shard distribution at the data path level.  So this is normal.\n\nSee also the explanation in the [2.0 Breaking Changes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/breaking_20_multiple_literal_data_path_literal_striping.html)\n\nClosing this issue as it is expected behaviour :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/259062206","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21396#issuecomment-259062206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21396","id":259062206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTA2MjIwNg==","user":{"login":"wenma","id":17975837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTc1ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17975837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenma","html_url":"https://github.com/wenma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-08T07:06:48Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T07:06:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@joshuar I see. now, I want to rebalance data manually,  is there a possible way to solve the situation ?\nmoreoverï¼ŒI think ES should rebalance data automatically in shards level on one ES node. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
