I am using below snippet with elastic search 6.0.0 client library\r\n\r\n`GetAliasesResponse r = client.admin().indices().getAliases(new GetAliasesRequest(\"aliasTemp\")).actionGet();\r\n    ImmutableOpenMap<String, List<AliasMetaData>> indexMap = r.getAliases();`\r\n\r\nindexMap contains index as key and values will be alias, My expectation is this indexMap would only have those indices as key which are actually associated with specific alias (\"aliasTemp\"). in this case index should be index A and index D only.\r\n\r\nBy searching with alias\"aliasTemp\" I am getting all the indices(i.e Index A, index B ,index D)as key in indexMap. But values are only present for index A and index D . Index B map value have empty list .\r\n\r\nIn elasticsearch 5.3.1 client api, above code works perfectly ,but with In elasticsearch 6.0.0 , these map contains all the indices as key.It should not contains all indices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"antitech","id":34387619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Mzg3NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/34387619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antitech","html_url":"https://github.com/antitech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antitech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antitech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antitech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antitech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antitech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antitech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antitech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antitech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antitech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
