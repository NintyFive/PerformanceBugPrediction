The jdbc plugin was used in this case. Since the import operation will be executed regulary I need to generate a document_id in order to avoid duplicated and redundant data. To get rid of this problem 2 approaches were adopted. \r\n\r\nThe first one consists in:  \r\n 1) Creating a new filed called Id, populate it with data coming from other attributes (table columns).  So it will play the role of a composite ID. In elasticsearch's Words, it consists in creating a field by concatenating multiple dynamic fields\r\n2) Setting the newly created field as a document_ID. \r\n\r\nBelow is the logstash config file that was generated to this purpose \r\n[sample.txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/2169483/sample.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first declared dynamic field will be correctly converted to a value while the others not. The Id that we get has this value \"ValueOfThefirstDynamicFieldWhichIsHost\"%{PORT}%{PID}. \r\nThis results to less records exported  to the elasticsearch as expected. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe second one consists in:\r\n1) Creating a fingerprint field using all the attributes needed.\r\n2) Setting this fingerprint as document_ID\r\n\r\nBelow is the logstash config file that was generated to this purpose \r\n[sample2.txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/2169502/sample2.txt)\r\n\r\nAs result, one and only one record will be exported to the elasticsearch. That means that each time a new record comes, it overwrites the old ones because persumably the same fingerprint will be generated for all records.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to your support and to your ideas. \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
