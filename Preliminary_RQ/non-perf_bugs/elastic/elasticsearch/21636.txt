When searching over _all I would expect highlighting to occur on all fields of the result when using `require_field_match: false`. Example query can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://pastebin.com/sAGczFhU\r\n\r\nMy use case is that nearly every search is done for an exact value or over _all. I could get extreme performance gains by shifting dynamically created fields to Keyword, and then if full-text search is needed, defining them explicitly in the mapping. However, search highlighting is still an important part of our workflow.\r\n\r\nDo I have a misunderstanding of how highlighting works? My interpretation is that\r\n1. We search over _all\r\n2. Hits are selected for highlighting as a postprocessing step\r\n3. Each field is matched against the original search query if require_field_match: false is set to true and the highlighting_query option is unused.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Create a new index with a mapping that sets dynamic fields to type Keyword\r\n 2. Add three new documents with `\"message\": \"Kostya Test\"`\r\n 3. Run the previous query (fixing the date range)\r\n\r\nExpected: There should be highlighted search text extracted from the _source fields that are loaded at highlight-time\r\nActual: No text is highlighted\r\n\r\nThe same can be repeated where the search is an exact match for the field, and no highlighting is done then either.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
