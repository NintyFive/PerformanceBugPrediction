Additionally, your documents likely go to different shards, so they are processed in parallel, the order is not defined.\n\nThe mapping for `title` is created by the document that has a non empty title. And sometimes it occurs before the document with an empty title is indexed (when you have 2 matches), sometimes after (when you have 1 match).\n\nI believe this would be fixed by creating dynamic mappings for empty strings but I'm unsure about side effects it could have.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
