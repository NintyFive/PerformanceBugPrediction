I´m interested at these plugin, too but I´ve got another reason. We are implementing a full text search for a huge customer, which has a difficult approve process for products like elasticsearch. If you want to use a new product or self hosted service you have to fill about ~1000 documents ;-) If you use a already approved servlet engine like a tomcat, jboss or weblogic you can elasticsearch without any problems. At the moment I use ES 1.7.0\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/159102695","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12721#issuecomment-159102695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12721","id":159102695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTEwMjY5NQ==","user":{"login":"roytmana","id":2524911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjQ5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2524911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana","html_url":"https://github.com/roytmana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T23:27:58Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T23:27:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Exactly the same here.
