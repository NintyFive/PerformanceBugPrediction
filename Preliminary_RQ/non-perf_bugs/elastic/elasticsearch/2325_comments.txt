In fact, we're discussing removing support for the `_routing` path in #6730. On top of that, multi-index, multi-type queries with potentially many different analyzer configurations would make this automatic routing a nightmare to implement and debug.\n\nIf you know what field should be used for routing, why not extract it in your application and use it as a routing value to the query?  Seems a lot simpler than trying to get it right within something as complex as the query dsl.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
