I wonder if it is something to do with that Tomcat instance. If you restart it does everything work properly? Like maybe its got a wrong version of Elasticsearch sitting around. But it is weird that is spits out that jar name. I'm not sure, to be hones.\r\n\r\nSince this sounds more like a Tomcat problem I think I should close this so the other repository maintainers don't get emails about it. If you'd like to continue the discussion on https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch I'll look for your post there.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
