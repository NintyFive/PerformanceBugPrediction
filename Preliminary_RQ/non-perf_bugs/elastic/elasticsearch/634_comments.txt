If there is any custom code (and right now I don't need any personally) if the event had the new calculated health value as an attribute that would be nice, to save the lookup.\n\nBut if no-one else is begging for it, I'm happy to close this.\n\ncheers,\n\nPaul\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/49507317","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/634#issuecomment-49507317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/634","id":49507317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTA3MzE3","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-19T11:49:39Z","updated_at":"2014-07-19T11:49:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Done! :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
