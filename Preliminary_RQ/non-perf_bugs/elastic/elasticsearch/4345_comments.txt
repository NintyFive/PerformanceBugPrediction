It was this commit which changed the behaviour: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/commits/dcef69b6d49351668cd74f83fb43890ddbf30c52\n\nIt changed the query from:\n\n```\n\"+text:12 +text:01 +text:2013 +text:12012013\"\n```\n\nto:\n\n```\n\"+(text:12 text:12012013) +text:01 +text:2013\"\n```\n\n(the order of emitted tokens has also changed, but the change in the query resulted from the way stacked tokens are treated)\n\nStacked tokens are considered to be alternatives for each other, as in synonyms.  \n\ni think the only way around this would be to set `generate_number_parts` to `false`\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
