I run the rollover job at 12 am UTC everyday,  and if traffic is coming to elastic search (content to be indexed) and rollover is in progress, then the bulk API is creating the index from the Alias sent as its parameter. However Bulk API does not specify that it would create an index if the index does not exist but the `index `action can create the index if it does not exist (Automatic Index Creation). Hence it might throw they exceptions that source alias is a concrete index while still in the rollover phase.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing how rollover is implemented internally, I could only speculate that rollover is not an atomic operation or there is no locking mechanism. The moderators can close this bug if they decide to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/528990159","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32883#issuecomment-528990159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32883","id":528990159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODk5MDE1OQ==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T19:46:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T19:46:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think with ILM in place and supporting Rollover, this is no longer needed since the instructions there set up a single alias to which to direct indexing.
