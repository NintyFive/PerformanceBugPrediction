Were you somehow overriding ObjectMapper? \n\nPart of the refactorings were to decouple parsing for a single field type, from parsing the entire document. Before, parsing the document was mixed back and forth between \"object\" parsing, and concrete fields. This decoupling meant moving part of ObjectMapper to a new class, DocumentParser, which was dedicated to parsing the actual document.\n\nWhile there is still work left to do with mappings, have you considered moving this logic out of mappings altogether? This seems like something that belongs more at the document construction before sending to elasticsearch, or perhaps with a custom sub-plugin in the future of the upcoming ingest plugin (#14049).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/176313101","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13775#issuecomment-176313101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13775","id":176313101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjMxMzEwMQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T18:11:36Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T18:11:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No further feedback.
