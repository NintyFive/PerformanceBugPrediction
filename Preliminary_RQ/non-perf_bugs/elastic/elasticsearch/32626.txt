A user can sort a list of results by the _id field in kibana and this issues a query that loads all of these values into the fielddata cache, which increases the heap usage, which then causes an OOM and nodes fall over. Is there a way to get _id to stop being loaded into the fielddata, or prevent it from being a sortable index so my users don't accidentally knock out a cluster?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nstep 1) clear the cache on the index we are searching `POST test-2018.08.03.14.00-1/_cache/clear`\r\nstep 2) Confirm the cache is cleared `GET _nodes/stats/indices/fielddata?level=indices` search for your index\r\nstep 3) Run A query over the time that would use that index\r\nstep 4) Now sort those results on the `_id` field\r\nstep 5) Check the size again  `GET _nodes/stats/indices/fielddata?level=indices` search for your index\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
