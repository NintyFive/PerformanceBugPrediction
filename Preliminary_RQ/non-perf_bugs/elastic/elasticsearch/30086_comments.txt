Per https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/21128, we want to:\r\n\r\n> Add CCR metrics collections to ES Metricbeat module\r\n\r\nFor this, some Elasticsearch API(s) need to expose the CCR metrics that would be interesting for end-users to monitor. Do you know which API(s) those might be or what fields in those API responses will carry said metrics? Thanks!\r\n\r\n[EDIT] If it helps, the kinds of CCR monitoring questions we want to be able to answer (thanks @yaronp68 for coming up with these):\r\n\r\n> Does my cluster trust other clusters? And are they really accessible?\r\n> How many indices in my cluster are followers?\r\n> Does replication really happen for my index? And If not why?\r\n> Is any follower index / shard in index lagging behind its leader? And be what number of operations?\r\n> Does the follower lacks resources (Storage / CPU / RAM) to cope with writing the data?\r\n> If the follower index is indeed connected to the leader remote index\r\n> If there is an lag of operations between follower and leader (how many operations behind)\r\n> Consider networking information (num of bytes received and, num of packages dropped / errors) to get an indication about quality of network and the replication load\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/410710636","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30086#issuecomment-410710636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30086","id":410710636,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDcxMDYzNg==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-06T13:37:55Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T13:37:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ycombinator From #32350 we introduced the endpoint `/_ccr/stats` which carries shard level metrics.
