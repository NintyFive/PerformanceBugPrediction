Was running fine with hot node, and rolling 50GB indexes from filebeat, metricbeat, and logstash to warm node.  After a week or so no more indexing and single sign on broke as disk showing full.  However when logged into Elastic.co console showed only 14% disk as did Elastic API commands via Kibana.\r\n\r\nElastic sales engineer confirmed issue, but I haven't been able to find it in Github so raising this issue now.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nUpgrade to 7.6 on Elastic.co\r\nSend data using beats, logstash\r\nDisk shows full even though it isn't.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
