I admit that I found it during testing and it may not be that common in production, but I still think a shorthand could be very handy for scripting tasks.

I don't think many people will want to do it and I think the syntax is confusing. Folks have been asking for some kind of pattern-wise reindex where they can specify multiple source indexes and multiple destination indexes and Elasticsearch just picks the right one. It is still a one for one copy though. We don't have that because we'd have to make assumptions about which index is the right one and I expect we'd be wrong as ofter as we are right. There are two work arounds for that (two reindex commands or using scripts). I think supporting writing to multiple indexes at a time would really confuse the folks that are looking for the pattern-wise reindex. And judging from discuss volume those folks are fairly common.\n\nAlso I don't think the consistency of APIs argument holds water. We have lots of APIs that don't allow you to target multiple indexes at once because it doesn't make sense like index, bulk, and update.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
