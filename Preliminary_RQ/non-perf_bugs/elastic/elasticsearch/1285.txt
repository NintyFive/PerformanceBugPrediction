It can be provided externally via the index request or in the `_source`. If it is not provided externally it will be automatically set to the date the document was processed by the indexing chain.\n## enabled\n\nBy default it is disabled, in order to enable it, the following mapping should be defined:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"tweet\" : {\n        \"_timestamp\" : { \"enabled\" : true }\n    }\n}\n```\n## store / index\n\nBy default the `_timestamp` field has `store` set to `no` and `index` set to `not_analyzed`. It can be queried as a standard date field.\n## path\n\nThe timestamp value can be provided as an external value when indexing. But, it can also be automatically extracted from the document to index based on a `path`. For example, having the following mapping:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"tweet\" : {\n        \"_timestamp\" : {\n            \"enabled\" : true,\n            \"path\" : \"post_date\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWill cause `2009-11-15T14:12:12` to be used as the timestamp value for:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"message\" : \"You know, for Search\",\n    \"post_date\" : \"2009-11-15T14:12:12\"\n}\n```\n\nNote, using `path` without explicit timestamp value provided require an additional (though quite fast) parsing phase.\n## format\n\nYou can define the date format used to parse the provided timestamp value. For example:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"tweet\" : {\n        \"_timestamp\" : {\n            \"enabled\" : true,\n            \"path\" : \"post_date\",\n            \"format\" : \"YYYY-MM-dd\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote, the default format is `dateOptionalTime`. The timestamp value will first be parsed as a number and if it fails the format will be tried.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
