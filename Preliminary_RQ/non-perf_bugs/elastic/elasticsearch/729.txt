Batching based on size as well is important since there might be big docs that will prove problematic to recover.\n\nThe following parameters allow to control peer recovery: \n- `index.shard.recovery.file_chunk_size`: The chunks index files will be broken down to when recovered. Defaults to `100kb`.\n- `index.shard.recovery.translog_size`: The batch size of translog operations. Defaults to `100kb`.\n- `index.shard.recovery.translog_ops`: The number of operations per batch. Defaults to `1000`.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
