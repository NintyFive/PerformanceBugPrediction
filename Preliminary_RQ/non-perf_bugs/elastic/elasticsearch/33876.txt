These searches typically run in the context of the kibana/kibana_system user/role. \r\n\r\nCurrently we'll have privilege problems if we try to execute a search against `apm-*` indices. The most straightforward solution to this would be to grant `read` access to the kibana user for `apm-*` data.\r\n\r\nThe kibana_system role grants `read` privilege to `.monitoring-*` indices. Based on the commit history, that also seems to be for management purposes. \r\n\r\ncc @sqren @makwarth @pickypg ","closed_by":{"login":"makwarth","id":841813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTgxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/841813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/makwarth","html_url":"https://github.com/makwarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makwarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makwarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makwarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makwarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makwarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makwarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makwarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makwarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makwarth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
