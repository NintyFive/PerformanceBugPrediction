We could implement it in elasticsearch, but on the other hand I have the feeling it would be more flexible/efficient/easy to do it from client side. For instance imagine we want to store percentages with a precision of 1%: the client would just have to multiply values by 100 at index time and index them as longs (or ints) rather than floats. And then it would also divide values by 100 when reading the _source or the result of histogram, min, max, terms, percentiles, ... aggregations. I think it is great that elasticsearch would be working directly on the \"compressed\" representation. If we want to do the same thing from within elasticsearch, first we have to figure out the right API to expose such numbers (which proved a bit tricky on the PR), and then either we need to add a multiplication on every doc values read, or we try to add the optimization to not decode every value but this is quite error-prone as we can optimize eg. histogram aggregations to divide post aggregation, but if the field is fed to the scripting API we still need to decode every value. So I'm afraid it would not be easy to expose in a generic way.\n\n(Also, for the record, even if better than regular floats, I think half floats would still be a poor option to index percentages.)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/220349050","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13625#issuecomment-220349050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13625","id":220349050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDM0OTA1MA==","user":{"login":"tsg","id":101817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTgxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/101817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsg","html_url":"https://github.com/tsg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T14:53:32Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T14:53:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The reason I don't like too much doing that in the client is that while we could easily do the conversion to int in Beats, we don't know how the user consumes the data, it might be via the Kibana discover tab or even directly via the Elasticsearch API.
