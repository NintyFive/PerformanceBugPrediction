For instance, if node-to-node TLS is enabled including full certificate verification then it is the hostname of the node's publish address that we are verifying.\r\n\r\nI suspect that #32729 was raised because we hide the hostname of the publish address. This log message was quoted as an example of the problem:\r\n\r\n    [2018-07-02T00:45:20,095][INFO ][o.e.t.TransportService   ] [data-0] publish_address {10.0.0.6:9300}, bound_addresses {10.0.0.6:9300}\r\n\r\nHowever this does not indicate that the hostname is lost. We simply don't show it. The same is true in the output from `GET _nodes`: \r\n\r\n    ...\r\n      \"transport\": {\r\n        \"bound_address\": [\r\n          \"127.0.0.1:9300\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"publish_address\": \"127.0.0.1:9300\",\r\n        \"profiles\": {}\r\n      },\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nSimilar to #32806, I think we should expose the hostname in these addresses to clarify that it's still there and to aid troubleshooting when setting up full certificate verification.","closed_by":{"login":"andrershov","id":600624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDYyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/600624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov","html_url":"https://github.com/andrershov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrershov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
