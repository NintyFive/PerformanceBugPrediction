Although the readable version is easy to read for human beings, it generates a lot of garbage in memory, which is something that we want to disable if not needed.\n\nLet's then add support for a new \"readable_format\" parameter that allows to control whether we want to print out the readable version or not.\n\nThe plan is to keep it backward compatible on 0.90 (the default value will be true , meaning that readable values will be printed out by default). As of 1.0 we'll change the default to false, therefore in order to have readable values printed out you'll need to explicitly ask for them.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
