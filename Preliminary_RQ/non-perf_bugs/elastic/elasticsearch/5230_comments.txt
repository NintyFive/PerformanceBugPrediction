If you need to extract specific fields from the `_source`, you can use [source filtering](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-source-filtering.html) which was added exactly with this goal in mind and is way more flexible as well.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
