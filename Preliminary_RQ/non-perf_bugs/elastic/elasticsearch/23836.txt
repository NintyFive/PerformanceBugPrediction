We should certainly fix the docs, but we really need to prevent these from using so much memory like we do with aggregations or the NFA -> DFA construction.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, setup the index like the documentation does:\r\n```\r\nPUT /example\r\n{\r\n    \"mappings\": {\r\n        \"doc\": {\r\n            \"properties\": {\r\n                \"location\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"geo_shape\",\r\n                    \"tree\": \"quadtree\",\r\n                    \"precision\": \"1m\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany of the examples are surprisingly slow. The `linestring` example takes half a second. The first `polygon` example takes 4.8 seconds. The second one takes 13 seconds. The next two fail entirely. The `multipolygon` and `geometrycollection` examples takes 21 seconds....\r\n\r\nThe`multilinestring` and `envelope` examples put the 2GB node into a GC death spiral.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
