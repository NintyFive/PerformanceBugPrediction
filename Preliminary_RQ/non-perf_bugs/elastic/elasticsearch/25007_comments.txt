However, the are some complications:\r\n - the transport client is going to be deprecated and removed\r\n - we do not want to entangle the transport client with Netty 4 as other transport implementations can be used\r\n - because of the way in which in plugins are instantiated, we do not have an easy way for a plugin to provide a specific object used to instantiate any of its dependencies\r\n\r\nThis means that to make all of this work:\r\n - we would need to add plumbing to be able to push a shared event loop group down\r\n - we would need to add a rather ugly static method to Netty4Plugin to enable setting the event loop group so that it can be pushed through the plumbing\r\n - this would then enable touching Netty classes before we have a chance to initialize which gets delicate because we go to great lengths to ensure we've initialized everything that we want before any Netty classes are touched as they start initializing\r\n\r\nGiven this, while I think this would be a good change to make, I do not think that it is a change that we should make. The combination of the transport client eventually being removed combined with the costs of making this change are not less than the benefits.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
