This could be a performance issue when the source document gets larger (e.g. many role descriptors or future derived API keys). One possible way to improve it is to check \"primary term\" and \"sequence number\" of the response and only deserialise the source if any of the two information have changed. Doing this also requires more information to be cached in the first read. So there is a balance between storage and speed.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywangd","id":2344308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDQzMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2344308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd","html_url":"https://github.com/ywangd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
