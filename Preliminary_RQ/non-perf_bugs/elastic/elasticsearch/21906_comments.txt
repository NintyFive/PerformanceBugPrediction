As for what I use it for, see this discussion that I started https://discuss.elastic.co/t/terms-stats-api/67508 and this feature request https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21886. Basically I want to get terms statistics (currently for re-ranking capabilities, and also at the moment outside of 'scripting') and the lack of API got me to try TV and artificial documents, where I send the list of terms I wish to get stats for as an artificial document, to all the shards.\r\n\r\nI would love to send a PR, but I'll need to do some work to setup a dev environment. I.e. I don't have an ES fork, not even Gradle installed 😄 , and so I cannot run ES tests, build the code etc. I will start doing that though, cause I wish to be able to contribute to the code (e.g. maybe this terms_stats API), so it seems worth it. In the meanwhile, I think perhaps if you/we implement something like an EmptyTermsEnum which assumes there are no terms to iterate on, and set `topLevelTerms` to such instance, the rest of the code would just work. But, if I want to test it, I need to setup the dev environment...\r\n\r\nAlso, what about that NPE?
