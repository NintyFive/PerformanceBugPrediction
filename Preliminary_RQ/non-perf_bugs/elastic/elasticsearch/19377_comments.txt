Deprecation headers are intended to alert the USER that the request that they have just run uses deprecated functionality (ie it provides the context to the user). As such, the official `Warning:` header is perfect for the purpose.\n\nWe also have deprecation logs, which provide the SYSADMIN with information that users are using deprecated functionality (but with less context).  If you wanted to make graphs out of deprecations, then consuming the deprecation logs would be the way to go.\n\nHowever, making graphs out of how many different types of deprecations there are really doesn't help much.  What you want to know is that there is NO use of deprecated functionality, as it will break in the next major version.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
