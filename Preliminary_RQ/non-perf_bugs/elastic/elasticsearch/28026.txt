Start 5.x\r\n2. Add a persistent cluster setting that is unsupported by 6.x\r\n3. Upgrade to 6.x\r\n4.

You can clear the archived setting with `PUT _cluster/settings { \"persistent\": { \"archived.*\": null } }` but you *must* do this before updating any other settings. It feels like you should be able to deal with the archived settings at your leisure.\r\n\r\nI put together a test that reproduces this by adding [this](https://gist.github.com/nik9000/84320047e828c773ec381eb433d64573) to FullClusterRestartIT.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
