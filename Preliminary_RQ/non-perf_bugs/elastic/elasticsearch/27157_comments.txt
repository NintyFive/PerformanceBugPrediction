The used memory is calculated as the total physical memory on the system minus the free physical memory on the system. The free physical memory on the system is ultimately obtained from `sysconf(_SC_AVPHYS_PAGES)` on Linux which includes only the pages the OS can allocate without flushing the cache or paging to disk. I am closing this as operating as intended.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
