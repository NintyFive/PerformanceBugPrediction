Example use cases include:\r\n\r\n1. An organization with multiple clusters, each under a different administrator, could set `\"administrator\": \"joe@example.com\"` to quickly identify the owner of each cluster.\r\n2. An organization with different clusters for Testing and Production could set `\"environment\": \"test\"` in the Testing cluster and verify in a test runner that this property is correctly set before running tests against that cluster.\r\n\r\nWe will address this by allowing users to use the [Cluster Settings API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-update-settings.html) to set arbitrary key/value pairs with a specific key prefix.  For example, if the key prefix is `cluster.metadata`, the example keys above would be `cluster.metadata.administrator` and `cluster.metadata.environment`.\r\n\r\nThese settings have no semantic meaning to them from Elasticsearch itself, and only serve to store information users wish to associate with their cluster.","closed_by":{"login":"gwbrown","id":1522844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjI4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1522844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/gwbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
