I read that the groovy team was consulted, but is there really nothing that can be done? I saw this article from a few years back, though I am not familiar with the java SecurityManager:\n\nhttp://www.chrismoos.com/2010/03/24/groovy-scripts-and-jvm-security/\n\nWould be great to have a way to do arithmetic and basic loops etc. in scripts. I'm using groovy for a scripted metric agg, and I don't see any way to do that anymore other than storing 4 separate groovy scripts on each node (init/map/combine/reduce). I would even say that groovy scripting would be great even if no classes were supported other than a predefined list used for these basic calculations. I understand the dynamic nature might make it impossible to ensure security, but if it could be done with severe limitations, I'd still say it's tremendously valuable.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
