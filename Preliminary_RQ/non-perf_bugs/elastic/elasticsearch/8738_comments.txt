If a shard is already allocated then it will only be moved off that node if there is somewhere else to put it.  I'm guessing that either you're running with just two nodes, or you have some other setting which is preventing allocation.\n\nTry using the cluster reroute API with `explain` to understand why your shards are not being moved.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/65212126","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8738#issuecomment-65212126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8738","id":65212126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MjEyMTI2","user":{"login":"cregev","id":7669819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Njk4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7669819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cregev","html_url":"https://github.com/cregev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cregev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cregev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cregev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cregev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cregev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cregev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cregev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cregev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cregev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-02T10:43:52Z","updated_at":"2014-12-02T10:43:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok  found the problem it was a setting issue.\n\nThanks,\nCostya.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
