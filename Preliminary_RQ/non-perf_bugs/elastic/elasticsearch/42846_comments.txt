Therefore not all shards can be active, so the all condition in wait for active shards all can not be met. The request times out waiting for this to happen, which per the previous, is expected. If you have additional questions, please use the forums as we reserve GitHub for bug reports and feature requests.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
