you implement an ingest factory which implements `Closeable`:\n\n``` java\npublic static final class Factory extends AbstractProcessorFactory<MyProcessor> implements Closeable {\n    @Override\n    public void close() throws IOException {\n        logger.debug(\"closing my processor factory\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `close()` method is never called which could lead to some leak threads when we close a node.\n\nThe `ProcessorsRegistry#close()` method exists though and seems to do the right job:\n\n``` java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    List<Closeable> closeables = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (Processor.Factory factory : processorFactories.values()) {\n        if (factory instanceof Closeable) {\n            closeables.add((Closeable) factory);\n        }\n    }\n    IOUtils.close(closeables);\n}\n```\n\nBut apparently this method is never called in
