Also quoting [Memory Compaction v8](https://lwn.net/Articles/384150/) (note: that source is almost 8 years old now so the information may or may not correct as of today):\r\n\r\n> Memory compaction can be triggered in one of three ways. It may be triggered\r\nexplicitly by writing any value to /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory and compacting\r\nall of memory. It can be triggered on a per-node basis by writing any\r\nvalue to /sys/devices/system/node/nodeN/compact where N is the node ID to\r\nbe compacted.
