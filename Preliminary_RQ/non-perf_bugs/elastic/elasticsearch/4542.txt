The fields option is supported in various apis (get, search and explain).\n\nThe behaviour when it comes to array fields with a single value is inconsistent between apis, between source and stored fields. Based on the previous an array field is either serialised as a single value or an array containing a single value.\n\nDoing the right thing here is difficult because the field option works on both _source and stored fields. The _source contains the meta information (json) to serialise field values correctly, but this information isn't available in stored fields. The plan is to make fields always return an array for both _source and stored fields and in all APIs with the goal to be consistent. Also the `fields` option can only serialise leaf fields, this to be further consistent between stored fields and _source. Metadata (`_id`, `_routing`, `_parent` etc.) fields are always single values, for this reason in the response the metadata fields are never wrapped in a json array.\n\nIf better serialisation is required for _source, the source filtering feature should be used instead: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/search-request-source-filtering.html\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
