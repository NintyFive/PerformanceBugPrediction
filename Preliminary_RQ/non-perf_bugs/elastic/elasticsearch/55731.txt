This works for all configuration parameters we have so far tried, with the exception of the `processors` setting.\r\n\r\nProviding an environment variable of `processors:2` does not seem to be picked up. On my dev machine this is still showing as `24` everywhere, and the threadpools remain too large.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is a known limitation, or if I need to provide that setting some other way. For various reasons, it would be pretty difficult to use the in-built docker CPU limiting to achieve this so I'd rather use the native ES way if possible.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
