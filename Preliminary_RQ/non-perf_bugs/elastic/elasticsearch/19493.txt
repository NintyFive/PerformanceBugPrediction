The output tokens are subsequently concatenated to form a suggestion.  Only one value can therefore be loaded by this process. In order to load multiple input values for a suggestion, users are currently required to list multiple inputs.\n\nThis ticket proposes allowing a configuration option to cause each token to be consumed as a separate suggestion - rather than concatenating to form a single output.  Whilst this would need to be used with caution, as it may lead to a \"bloated\" FST structure, it would mean users could utilises the full capability of the analyzers chain - splitting out multiple possible inputs for matching.\n","closed_by":{"login":"gingerwizard","id":12695796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk1Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12695796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gingerwizard","html_url":"https://github.com/gingerwizard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gingerwizard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gingerwizard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gingerwizard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gingerwizard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gingerwizard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gingerwizard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gingerwizard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gingerwizard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gingerwizard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
