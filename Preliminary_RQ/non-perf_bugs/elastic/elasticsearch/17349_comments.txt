In 6.1 its \"index format changes\" in that it uses docvalues and encodes slightly differently into the BKD. In 6.1 it uses two-phase iterator for all operations (this is currently very important for performance, the 6.0 version would have performance regressions to users.) Also it gets an efficient sort comparator that does not need to do kagillions of haversin comparisons. But, it still has some known bugs around corner cases and other sandiness, so there is still work to do. I think we can get it cleaned up for 6.1\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/376232666","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17349#issuecomment-376232666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17349","id":376232666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjIzMjY2Ng==","user":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T16:44:59Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T16:44:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"closing in favor of #16749 ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
