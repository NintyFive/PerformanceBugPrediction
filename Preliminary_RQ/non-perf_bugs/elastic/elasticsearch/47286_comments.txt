closer inspection, all the failures occur when the old version in the BWC test is earlier than 6.6.0.\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure that the problem lies in this setup code in `MlConfigIndexMappingsFullClusterRestartIT`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Before\r\n    public void waitForMlTemplates() throws Exception {\r\n        List<String> templatesToWaitFor = XPackRestTestConstants.ML_POST_V660_TEMPLATES;\r\n        XPackRestTestHelper.waitForTemplates(client(), templatesToWaitFor);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt needs a change similar to the one made in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/47112/files#diff-2ce666ebd3338dbd6cc08ba88d6e86d2L71-R77 but with 6.6.0 instead of 7.4.0.\r\n\r\nPreviously when the BWC version was older than 6.6.0 an `AwaitBusy` in the test setup would never meet its objective but then carry on after 10 seconds (leading to a slowdown of 10 seconds in the test).  Now the `AssertBusy` fails the test in this case.\r\n\r\n#47112 has exposed this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/536572673","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/47286#issuecomment-536572673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/47286","id":536572673,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjU3MjY3Mw==","user":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-30T13:56:18Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T13:56:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed by #47289","performed_via_github_app":null}]
