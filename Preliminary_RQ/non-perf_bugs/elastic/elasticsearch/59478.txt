You have to consult a single terms index rather than many. You have a single posting list to walk. If you are doing phrase queries you only have one positions list to load too. It saved us quite a bit of disk IO.\r\n>\r\n> It's important that this really is only something that you want for `should` clauses, no `must` clauses. `must` can do some \"leap frogging\" tricks that'll save quite a bit of time. But you often want to do a bunch of `should` clauses for a search box.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see this information captured in our docs somewhere, possibly in the [copy_to docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/copy-to.html) or maybe on a dedicated page in some sort of \"Pro tips\" context. Users of the Kibana mappings editor would be able to discover this content from the UI (there's already a link), which will help anyone who is trying to make a decision about how/whether to use `copy_to`.","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
