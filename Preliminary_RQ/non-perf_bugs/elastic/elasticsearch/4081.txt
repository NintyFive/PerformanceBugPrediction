So given the following documents:\n\n```\nPUT /index/foo/1\n{\n    \"count\": 1,\n    \"foo\": {\n        \"count\": 1\n    }\n}\n\nPUT /index/bar/2\n{\n    \"count\": 1,\n    \"foo\": {\n        \"count\": 1\n    }\n}\n```\n\n.... the field `foo.count` could resolve to `foo.count`, `foo.foo.count`, or `bar.foo.count`, depending on which is found first.\n\nField resolution should be unambiguous. Field names should be grouped by type and sorted in descending order by number of `.`. So the above mappings should result in:\n\n```\nbar:\n    foo.count\n    count\n\nfoo:\n   foo.count\n   count\n```\n\nThen if no type is specified (or multiple types are specified), go through the groups in alphabetical order.\n\nThis would result in the following resolutions:\n\n```\nfoo.foo.count   => (foo) foo.count\nfoo.count       => (foo) count\ncount           => (bar) count\n*.foo.count     => (bar) foo.count\n*.count         => (bar) count\n*.*.count       => (bar) foo.count\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
