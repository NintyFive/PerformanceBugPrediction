Occasionally I see the following DEBUG stack trace (few of them are logged sequentially) in the log file. No search requests are failing around the same time though. There was nothing wrong with the cluster too when this exception was logged. Is this exception harmless? If not, what are the repercussions? I did some digging around the same exception on the internet and in the Issues list of Elasticsearch but I found most of those issues were related to `scan` and `scroll`. We don't use `scan` and `scroll` search requests.
