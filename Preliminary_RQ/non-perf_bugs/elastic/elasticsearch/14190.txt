Some arguments can be provided directly to the builder, but they become part of the inner source object. \n- confusing behaviour (especially after #13859) e.g. in `client.prepareSearch().addSort(sort).setSource(source)` the setSource wipes the sort criteria that was added in the first place.\n\nAfter #13859 we parse queries on the coordinating node, but the rest of the `SearchSourceBuilder` is still streamed as json bytes array to the data nodes and parsed once per data node. Once we have refactored all of the search sections (listed in #10217) all of the parsing will happen on the coordinating node, and it will be the right time to revise the `SearchRequest` object structure. It might very well be that the `SearchSourceBuilder` object is not needed anymore and all of its getters/setters can be collapsed to the `SearchRequest`/`SearchRequestBuilder`. Anyways we should have a single consistent way of settings things to the `SearchRequestBuilder` rather than the confusing multiple options that we have now.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
