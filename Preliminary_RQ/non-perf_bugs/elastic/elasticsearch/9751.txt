The next day, Kibana 4 is throwing errors on the Discover tab and nothing works. Overnight, the oldest index was intentionally deleted by cron.\n\nIf I then delete all my scripted fields, Kibana 4 starts working again. I can re-add them, continue on my merry way.\n\nI couldn't find any errors in the node service logs.
