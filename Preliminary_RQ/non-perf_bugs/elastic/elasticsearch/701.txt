I have set the default analyzers to use the ngram tokenfilter. This is my elasticsearch.yml file:\n\n```\nindex:\nanalysis:\n    analyzer:\n        default_index:\n            tokenizer: standard\n            filter: [standard, stop, mynGram]\n        default_search:\n            tokenizer: standard\n            filter: [standard, stop]\n\n    filter:\n        mynGram:\n            type: nGram\n            min_gram: 1\n            max_gram: 10\n```\n\nI created a new index and added the following document to it:\n\n```\n$ curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/test/newtype/3 -d '{\"text\": \"one two three four five six\"}'\n{\"ok\":true,\"_index\":\"test\",\"_type\":\"newtype\",\"_id\":\"3\"}\n```\n\nHowever, when I search using the query `text:hree` or `text:ive` or any other partial terms, ElasticSearch does not return this document. It returns the document only when I search for the exact term (like `text:two`). \n\nI have also tried changing the config file such that default_search also uses the ngram token filter, but the result was the same. \n\nAm I doing something wrong here? If so how do I correct it? If not, why is it not returning the expected result?\n\nThanks in advance for your time and help.\n","closed_by":{"login":"asleepysamurai","id":578033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/578033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asleepysamurai","html_url":"https://github.com/asleepysamurai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asleepysamurai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asleepysamurai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asleepysamurai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asleepysamurai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asleepysamurai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asleepysamurai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asleepysamurai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asleepysamurai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asleepysamurai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
