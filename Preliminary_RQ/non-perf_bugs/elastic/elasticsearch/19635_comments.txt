We reserve github for confirmed bug reports and feature requests.\n\nAlso, please read [how snapshots work](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html)  carefully. In particular:\n\n> The index snapshot process is incremental. In the process of making the index snapshot Elasticsearch analyses the list of the index files that are already stored in the repository and copies only files that were created or changed since the last snapshot. That allows multiple snapshots to be preserved in the repository in a compact form.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
