This adds pressure on memory and can lead to long GCs.  maybe you want to reduce the number of buckets to return, or if you want them all I suggest to use composite aggregation to paginate the results (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-composite-aggregation.html).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/393443655","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30991#issuecomment-393443655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30991","id":393443655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzQ0MzY1NQ==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T07:54:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T07:54:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-search-aggs","performed_via_github_app":null}]
