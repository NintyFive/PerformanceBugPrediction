My only worry is that I saw it used in many templates, including by users who only plan on having a single type anyway. So I'm thinking of deprecating in 6.0 since it is the first version to enforce a single type, but only removing in 7.0 in order for existing templates to keep working a bit longer, similarly to how we added a translation layer from strings to text/keyword in order to keep templates working when we released 5.0?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/312837985","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25500#issuecomment-312837985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25500","id":312837985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjgzNzk4NQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-04T10:01:02Z","updated_at":"2017-07-04T10:21:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jpountz  agreed","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/312896836","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25500#issuecomment-312896836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25500","id":312896836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjg5NjgzNg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-04T14:50:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-04T14:50:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jpountz @colings86 actually i think we should deprecate in 5.6 and remove in 7.0.
