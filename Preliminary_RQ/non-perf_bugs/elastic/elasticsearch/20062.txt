Most developers here use intellij, but intellij and eclipse have different defaults. The matter is further complicated by a couple issues:\n- Lucene uses the eclipse order (java imports first), so those who work on lucene as well are used to that (and at least I have intellij defaults set to match the eclipse defaults for this reason).\n- Gradle+intellij do not provide the ability to customize this, so the intellij project generated for gradle always uses the intellij defaults (whatever that is set to in the users global defaults).\n- It might be possible to generate eclipse and gradle projects with the same settings, but that would require maintaining manually edited intellij xml setting files, like lucene does\n\nI don't have much of an opinion on this, but do think it would be nice if (my) PRs did not often have import statement reordering. But I also don't think just saying \"we must use intellij defaults\" is adequate enough of a policy. IMO the only way saying we use a specific order can work is if we do the work to make the generated intellij project consistent with the eclipse project (in project settings for both).\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
