Here's where my problem comes in, my application is using indices which are returned in the JSON response body of \"_aliases\" (of course the number of investigated indexes is limited but I check the existence of index by this way) . For instance, the result of \"_aliases\" includes indices that are closed, and my application tries to search in these indexes, but an exception will be occurred because the \"alias\"/\"index\" is closed.  Basically yes, I would like if it were an option (which would be specified in the elasticsearch.ini) to ignore/skip the closed indices instead of throwing an exception. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/147631665","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14043#issuecomment-147631665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14043","id":147631665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzYzMTY2NQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-13T07:41:00Z","updated_at":"2015-10-13T07:41:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@onthefloorr This is implemented in 2.0.
