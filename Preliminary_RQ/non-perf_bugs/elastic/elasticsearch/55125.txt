Both, AdoptOpenJDK and Oracle, will now pull from their respective official download sources\r\n\r\n- People will not have to trust “random” binaries on Elastic’s Artifactory server\r\n\r\n- Elastic no longer needs to maintain an external antifactory for JDKs\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mark-vieira","id":4106672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4106672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-vieira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
