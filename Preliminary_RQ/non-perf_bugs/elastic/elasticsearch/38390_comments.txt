I am already working on a solution for read-only engines to not load it by default.\r\n\r\nThanks @s1monw for making this change. While having this as default for read-only engine is good, it is still relevant for read-write engines with low update ratio compared to read. Maybe, we can use the ratio of deleted documents to searchable documents for making that decision?\r\n\r\n>I also don't think we should expose this level of granularity to the user by allowing a setting.\r\n\r\nI totally agree that user should not be exposed to such granular setting. And, as mentioned [here](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/601#discussion_r264373499) earlier, we should add cluster level/index level boolean setting, which if set, puts PK eligible fields offheap. Non PK eligible fields are anyways offheap by default.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
