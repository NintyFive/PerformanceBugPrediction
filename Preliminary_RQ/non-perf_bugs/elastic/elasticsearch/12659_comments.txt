It doesn't make sense to use version numbers with upserts as a version number can never match a missing doc.  Really you want to use the create API here instead.\n\nRegarding scripts, there is nothing to stop you from having the script saved in a file in config/scripts/ and using it in your update command. File scripts don't suffer from the same problems as inline scripts.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
