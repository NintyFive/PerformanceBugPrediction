If reindex-from-remote gets back unexpected data the error message tends to look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"error\": {\r\n      \"root_cause\": [\r\n         {\r\n            \"type\": \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n            \"reason\": \"Required [version]\"\r\n         }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"type\": \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n      \"reason\": \"Required [version]\"\r\n   },\r\n   \"status\": 400\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich looks like a parse error in the request the user sent. This should be some other error, one that makes it obvious that the remote server returned text that doesn't make sense to reindex-from-remote. It should also include the response from the remote.","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
