When server comes up elasticsearch starts correctly, but the PID file is missing. We have configured /var/run/elasticsearch/ and the directory is empty, so we are not able to stop elasticsearch with the init.d script.\r\nIf we stop and start elasticsearch without rebooting the server the PID file will be created correctly. Before upgrading to 6.3.x this was not a issue.\r\n\r\nAnyone has same issue or a idea?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJochen","closed_by":{"login":"joschi99","id":6400595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDA1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6400595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joschi99","html_url":"https://github.com/joschi99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joschi99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joschi99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joschi99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joschi99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joschi99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joschi99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joschi99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joschi99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joschi99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
