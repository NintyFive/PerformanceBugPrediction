According to the documentation (http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html), we have to type this :\n$ curl -XGET localhost:9200/_template/temp*\nBut we have only the template put via this command :\n$ curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/template_1 -d[...]\n\nBut if we have template files in /etc/elasticsearch/templates and there are loaded at the start step, we don't see them if we type the first command line above.\n\nI use the deb elasticsearch 0.90.9.\n\nCan you confirm that or not ?\n\nThank you !\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
