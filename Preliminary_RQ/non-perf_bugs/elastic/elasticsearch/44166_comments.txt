The 7.x commit that was incompatible with the master commit being built was made at 08:59 UTC.\r\n\r\nLooking at the build log the 7.x source was pulled and compiled at 07:50 UTC.  It was revisited later in the build though.  This failure implies that the 7.x source is being re-fetched later in the build process, around 11:45 UTC.  I don't think this used to happen a few weeks ago.  It means the only way to backport changes to wire serialization without causing large numbers of build failures is to disable the BWC tests.  I'm sure it used to be possible to backport such changes more easily.\r\n\r\nLet's see if this problem goes away after master intake build 575.  If it doesn't then all the above analysis is wrong and there's a problem with the ML code rather than branch incompatibility.  So this is still failing in intake build 575 I'll mute the tests but if I'm right then to mute them now will not reduce noise and will just cause more work.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/510498749","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44166#issuecomment-510498749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44166","id":510498749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDQ5ODc0OQ==","user":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-11T14:02:02Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T14:02:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Master intake build 575 passed, and the failures of other builds due to this have stopped since then, so  I think it was just a branch incompatibility problem.
