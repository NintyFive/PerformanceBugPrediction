Currently the language has strict typing making it very similar to Java.  However, given the languages that people are used to this may be an issue, longer term.  It's likely I won't solve this in a week, but wanted to explore the possibility as something to do after the initial release with the need to make sure that it's at least possible with the current design.\n\nAs it stands the following features exist:\n\n1) Native types - boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double, object, string, list, and map including the ability to cast when necessary\n2) Arithmetic operators - multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, precedence ( )\n3) Comparison operators - less than <, less than or equal to <=, greater than >, greater than or equal to >=, equal to ==, and not equal to !=\n4) Boolean operators - not !, and &&, or ||\n5) Bitwise operators - shift left <<, shift right >>, unsigned shift >>>, and &, or |, xor ^, not ~\n6) A language definition specified in a properties file that allows the ability to add more types (Java classes), and serves as a whitelist for all the things available to create and call.\n7) Assignment operations for native types (int x; x = 0;) including increment, decrement, +=, -=, etc.\n8) Control flow - if, else if, else and for, while, do-while using brackets { } and semicolons ; to denote the end of operations/lines\n9) Shortcuts for maps and lists using brace notation such as (int x = (int)map[\"test0\"][0][\"test1\"];) where test0 is an index into a map, 0 is an index into a list, test1 is an index into a map, where the value is casted from object to int.\n10) A string concatenation operator in the form of '..' instead of '+' because '+' leads to ambiguities such as \"string\" + 2 + 2, where in java this ends up being string22 as a string, but I believe this may be confusing\n11) Promotion for numerics is done in the form of the java style where things are upcast as necessary (int -> double, or long -> float, etc.) or require a cast if promotion cannot be done (long --> int, etc.)\n12) Auto-boxing -- since this is using basic types and is written using the JVM, auto boxing is necessary, and will be done when it can be automatically\n\nA small example of the language definition:\nclass.object  = object   java.lang.Object // define java class Object as the type object\nclass.string  = string   java.lang.String   // define string class String as the type string\nmethod.object.string = object string string toString() // define java class Object toString method as string for use on the object type\n...\n\nA small example of what a script will look like:\n\nlist nums = input[\"inner\"][\"list\"];\nint size = nums.size();\ndouble total = 0;\nfor (int count = 0; count < size; ++count) {\n    total += (double)nums[count];\n}\nreturn total;\n\nwhere the automatically generated signature for the script is Object execute(Map<String, Object> input);\n\nNote that this can be thought of as a single static Java method when writing the script.  There is no way to script new functions/methods as if that's necessary, scripting may not be the best choice for the work that needs to be done in most cases.  It may also be possible to add the ability to execute other scripts from the original script to make up for the lack of method calls, but will likely not be included in the initial release.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/149294238","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13084#issuecomment-149294238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13084","id":149294238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTI5NDIzOA==","user":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-19T17:44:54Z","updated_at":"2015-10-19T17:44:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Quick update:\n\n@rmuir has added ES plugin logic for the prototype language.

(While this works in Java, some of the assumptions that need to be made may not be for the best in all situations.)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/151281119","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13084#issuecomment-151281119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13084","id":151281119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTI4MTExOQ==","user":{"login":"eskibars","id":2246002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDYwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2246002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars","html_url":"https://github.com/eskibars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-26T20:50:58Z","updated_at":"2015-10-26T20:50:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jdconrad yes, I was referring to string concatenation\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/154095367","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13084#issuecomment-154095367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13084","id":154095367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDA5NTM2Nw==","user":{"login":"damienalexandre","id":225704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTcwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/225704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre","html_url":"https://github.com/damienalexandre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienalexandre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T15:35:01Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T15:35:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great stuffs! One issue I have with scripting in Elasticsearch is that is really hard to test and debug a script; We need, IMO:\n- a way to play a script against any indexed document (maybe an API `index/type/123/_script`?)\n- a debug mode, maybe integrated in `?explain` to show:\n  - the count of instructions (specially if you limit them)\n  - all the available variables\n  - the return value, un-edited\n- a way to log directly in Elasticsearch logs without playing with Java imports\n- better exceptions: if a script fail, often, we get a QueryExec exception but the actual scripting error is hidden in the stack.\n\nMaybe this new (un-named?) scripting language could fix or at least improve those points :) \n\nCheers from Elastic{ON} Paris! :beers: \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/154126739","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13084#issuecomment-154126739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13084","id":154126739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDEyNjczOQ==","user":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T17:16:41Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T17:16:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@damienalexandre Thanks for the feedback here.
