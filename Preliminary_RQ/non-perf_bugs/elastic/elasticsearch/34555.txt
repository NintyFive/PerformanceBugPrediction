Recently I updated the Elasticsearch version from 6.2 to 6.4 and when this query is executed using the official PHP package, I am getting an error message in my log file which it looks like this:\r\n\r\n[full_stack_trace.txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/2487606/full_stack_trace.txt)\r\n\r\nI have 4 queries in my multi search query, from which only 2 of them are failing (those are the similar ones - one of those two is pasted bellow). The error is logged every time when the \"option group\" / \"option\" top hits aggregation need to be done.\r\n\r\n[query.txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/2487615/query.txt)\r\n\r\nIt is important to mention that this is not the case when I try to execute this query via Kibana. When executed through Kibana I receive correct results. Previously, on 6.2 version, this was not an issue at all.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the problem appears at the last two top_hits aggregations. If I remove them, I receive correct results.\r\n\r\nI had 1 node and 2 shards on my local machine when the problem actually appeared. When I increased the number of shards to 3 or 5, the problem disappeared.\r\n\r\nI checked the the two indexes I am querying in my Kibana monitoring section and this is the strange thing I have noticed:\r\n\r\n> name: index1\r\n    status: Health: green Green\r\n    document count: 550\r\n    data: 211.4 KB\r\n    index rate: 0 /s\r\n    search rate: 0.01 /s\r\n    unassigned shards: 0\r\n\r\nIt is strange that I have only 28 indexed documents in index1 for real, so I am confused how this numbers are counted and what they actually represent?\r\n\r\nI have a workaround for this problem with increasing the number of shards. But it's strange to allocate 5 shards because of two indexes with 28 and 112 documents stored in them in order to make those aggregations working.\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
