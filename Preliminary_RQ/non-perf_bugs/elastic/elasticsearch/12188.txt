The results stream back to the client and the client can close the tcp connection when it has enough results and the server stops producing results. I was wondering if it might make sense to do something similar to Elasticsearch. The advantage it'd have over scan/scroll is that its simpler to reason about when server side resources are in use - only as long as the tcp connection is open to the client.\n\nI don't know enough about the overhead of scan/scroll to know if its worth doing. It doesn't solve the infinite scroll problem either - for that you need an efficient way for clients to poll deeply and this just isn't it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
