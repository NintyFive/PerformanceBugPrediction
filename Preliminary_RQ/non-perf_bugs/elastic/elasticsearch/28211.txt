version**: `Version: 6.1.1, Build: bd92e7f/2017-12-17T20:23:25.338Z, JVM: 1.8.0_144`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: `[analysis-icu, analysis-phonetic]`\r\n\r\n\r\n**JVM version**: `java version \"1.8.0_144\"`\r\n\r\n**OS version**: `Darwin Kernel Version 17.3.0`\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nDaitch-Mokotoff analyzer returns only one token when it should return multiple.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n        \"analyzer_daitch_mokotoff\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"custom\",\r\n          \"tokenizer\":

'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{\r\n  \"analyzer\": \"analyzer_daitch_mokotoff\",\r\n  \"text\": \"CHAUPTMAN\"\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should return 573660 (ch sounding like tch) and 473660 (ch sounding like kh) but instead only returns 473660.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"tokens\" : [\r\n    {\r\n      \"token\" : \"473660\",\r\n      \"start_offset\" : 0,\r\n      \"end_offset\" : 9,\r\n

feature in the phonetic plugin is not usable.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
