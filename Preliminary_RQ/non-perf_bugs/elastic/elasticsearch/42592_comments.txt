For instance `mappings` do accept comments but a GET _mappings will return the schema without the comments while the comments in `_source` documents are preserved in search response if the source is not filtered. However it can be useful for users to have their comments in the original file, for instance in version control, so we agreed that we could document this support with the current limitation. We also said that comments are not in the JSON specification so being lenient is acceptable but we don't want to have an official support for it since it would complexify the handling in lot of places (order of fields in json, ...).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/539053785","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42592#issuecomment-539053785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42592","id":539053785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTA1Mzc4NQ==","user":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-07T14:58:54Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T14:58:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"[docs issue triage]\r\n\r\nClosing this issue.
