The default configuration file is :\n\n<pre>\n# Unicast Discovery (disable multicast)\n#discovery:\n# zen:\n# multicast.enabled: false\n# unicast.hosts: [\"host1\", \"host2\"]\n</pre>\n\n\nSo I tried with :\n\n<pre>\n# Unicast Discovery (disable multicast)\ndiscovery:\n zen:\n multicast.enabled: false\n unicast.hosts: [\"10......\", \"10.......\"]\n</pre>\n\nBut it didn't worked ! \nWhile looking at http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Unicast-help-td2683463.html I saw that I must enclose these statements in a \"ping\" section and I added unicast.enabled: true.\n\nAnd it works then ! With :\n\n<pre>\n# Unicast Discovery (disable multicast)\ndiscovery:\n  zen:\n    ping:\n      multicast.enabled: false\n      unicast.enabled: true\n      unicast.hosts: [\"10.33.170.156\", \"10.33.171.234\"]\n</pre>\n\n\nAm I wrong or is there a problem with the default config which is misleading ?\n\nThanks for your work !\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
