Also, add indexing stats providing statistics on indexing operation (delete/index).\n\nThe following returns high level aggregation and index level stats for all indices:\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9200/_stats\n```\n\nSpecific index stats can be retrieved using:\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9200/index1,index2/_stats\n```\n\nBy default, `docs`, `store`, and `indexing` stats are returned, other stats can be enabled as well:\n- `docs`: The number of docs / deleted docs (docs not yet merged out). Note, affected by refreshing the index.\n- `store`: The size of the index.\n- `indexing`: Indexing statistics, can be combined with a comma separated list of `types` to provide document type level stats.\n- `merge`: merge stats.\n- `flush`: flush stats.\n- `refresh`: refresh stats.\n- `clear`: Clears default set flags (`docs`, `store`, and `indexing`).\n\nHere are some samples:\n\n```\n# Get back stats for merge and refresh on top of the defaults\ncurl 'localhost:9200/_stats?merge=true&refresh=true'\n# Get back stats just for flush\ncurl 'localhost:9200/_stats?clear=true&flush=true'\n# Get back stats for type1 and type2 documents for the my_index index\ncurl 'localhost:9200/my_index/_stats?clear=true&indexing=true&types=type1,type2\n```\n\nThe stats returned are aggregated on the index level, with `primaries` and `total` aggregations. In order to get back shard level stats, set the `level` parameter to `shards`.\n## Specific stats endpoints\n\nInstead of using flags to indicate which stats to return, specific REST endpoints can be used, for example:\n\n```\n# Merge stats across all indices\ncurl localhost:9200/_stats/merge\n# Merge stats for the my_index index\ncurl localhost:9200/my_index/_stats/merge\n# Indexing stats for my_index\ncurl localhost:9200/my_index/_stats/indexing\n# Indexing stats for my_index for my_type1 and my_type2\ncurl localhost:9200/my_index/_stats/indexing/my_type1,my_type2\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
