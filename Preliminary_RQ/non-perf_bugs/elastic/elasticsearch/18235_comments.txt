You're missing a lot of information here eg size of segments, number of segments, any merge throttling, free disk space, etc etc.\n\nI suggest starting out by providing the above information in a question in the forum instead: https://discuss.elastic.co/\n\nIf you identify an actual bug (which hasn't been resolved in a newer release) then open a ticket here.\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
