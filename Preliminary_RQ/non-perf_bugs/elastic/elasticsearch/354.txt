Thrift should provide better performance over http (hopefully). Since thrift provides both the wire protocol and the transport, it should make using it simpler (thought its lacking on docs...).\n\nThe thrift file is: http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/master/plugins/transport/thrift/elasticsearch.thrift.\n\nSettings are:\n- `thrift.type`: Can be either `threadpool`, `threadpool_framed`, `nonblocking`, and `hsha`. Defaults to `threadpool` (the default on hbase and cassandra).\n- `thrift.port`: The port to bind to. Defaults to `9500-9600`.\n- `thrift.protocol`: Either `compact` or `binary`. Defaults to `binary`.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
