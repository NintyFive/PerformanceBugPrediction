Understand what data users use? Understand how much memory and cpu it took to process the user request? What requests are sent to the elastic? Looking for users who send large elastic requests? Search for specific queries that led to the failure or slow work of the cluster? See the most popular indices and queries to them from important users for us to optimize specific indices?\r\nIt would also be nice to be able to limit resource consumption for specific users in any way.\r\nThat is, it is about linux \"top\" like utility for Elastic because we have multiuser cluster. These are very important questions to meet the needs of users.\r\nWe have more than 100 users, but for example we donâ€™t understand which specific users cause the elastic to work slowly. And also we cannot limit such users so that the other majority of users do not experience problems.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dliappis","id":1754575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTQ1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1754575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis","html_url":"https://github.com/dliappis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
