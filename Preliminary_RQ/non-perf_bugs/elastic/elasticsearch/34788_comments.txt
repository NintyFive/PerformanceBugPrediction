If you can ask your question there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that should be able to help with your question.\r\nAs such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
