It also tends to be less lenient, for instance you wouldn't get any exception in the code above if `from+length` happens to overflow, while `Objects#checkFromIndexSize` would detect it.\r\n\r\nThese bound checks are only available in Java 9 onwards but Lucene already did the work of making those available in Java 8 as well (just not as intrinsics) via the `org.apache.lucene.util.FutureObjects` class. Calls to methods of this class are effectively replaced with calls to `java.util.Objects` if you are running Java 9 or newer.","closed_by":{"login":"pugnascotia","id":8696382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTYzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8696382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia","html_url":"https://github.com/pugnascotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
