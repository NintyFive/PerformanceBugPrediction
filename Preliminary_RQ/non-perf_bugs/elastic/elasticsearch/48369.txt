a `SecurityExtension` that provides a custom realm must fit into the following limitations:\r\n- Have a [no-args constructor](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.5/x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/core/security/SecurityExtension.java#L104)\r\n- Provide one or more `Realm.Factory` instances, [using only a ResourceWatcherService](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.5/x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/core/security/SecurityExtension.java#L40)\r\n- In that factory, [construct a realm](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.5/x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/core/security/authc/Realm.java#L164) from a `RealmConfig` object only\r\n\r\nThat means that the only supporting objects that a realm can easily depend on are:\r\n- ResourceWatcherService\r\n- RealmConfig\r\n\r\nIf it wants anything else, it needs to get acces via the `Plugin` API.\r\nThings that custom-realm-authors have said that they would like to have access to include:\r\n- An Elasticsearch `Client` (which they can get from `Plugin.createComponents`, but then need to save somewhere so the realm can access it)\r\n- The `NativeRoleMappingStore` (as a `UserRoleMapper`, which can be retrieved from Guice, but that's something we're actively working to remove).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
