by @111andre111\r\n\r\nProvide the following information to help us identify and troubleshoot the issue.\r\n- Page URL: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cat-recovery.html\r\n\r\nThere are missing parameters in that documentation which I found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/6.7/docs/reference/cat/recovery.asciidoc\r\n\r\nI got a hint from CSH about a flag of the _cat/recovery with the parameter active_only, but you can't find it there.\r\n\r\nHere you can find a hint about that a little bit:\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-recovery.html\r\nBut even then there is still one parameter missing.\r\n\r\nI had a look into the source code here:\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/6.7/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/rest/action/admin/indices/RestRecoveryAction.java#L54\r\nThere you see three parameters:\r\n- active_only\r\n- detailed\r\n- index\r\n\r\nBut this is even not represented in the \r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/6.7/rest-api-spec/src/main/resources/rest-api-spec/api/indices.recovery.json\r\n\r\nSo to summarise that, for that customer it is not intuitive to find the correct parameters at least for the recovery API.\r\n\r\nBy the way a swagger documentation like this would be very helpful and more intuitive I think https://petstore.swagger.io.\r\nThat would be cool to have something like this.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\n\r\nAndr√©","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
