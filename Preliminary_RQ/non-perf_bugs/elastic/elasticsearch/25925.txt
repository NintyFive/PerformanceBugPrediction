This occurs mainly during night when the instance load is minimal.\r\n![elasticissue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2367953/28659080-5eae6fce-72ae-11e7-9194-d00d70806249.png)\r\n\r\nThe network connection between nodes is working, I was able to connect to the nodes with curl.\r\n\r\nPlease see the log attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n[elastic.log.txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/1179162/elastic.log.txt)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
