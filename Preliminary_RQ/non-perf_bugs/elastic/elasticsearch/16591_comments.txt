However, currently we see this as an undesirable problem rather than a benefit.\n\nAs a workaround, if you do want this effect, you _can_ force merge your index down to a single segment and snapshot afterward. In doing so, then you get the same effect and you only have to download a single file that does not need to be decompressed at the end.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/182572536","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16591#issuecomment-182572536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16591","id":182572536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjU3MjUzNg==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T20:34:10Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T20:34:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Storage may be reduced for upload, download, and storage itself.\n\nthis might not be as much as you wish it would be...
