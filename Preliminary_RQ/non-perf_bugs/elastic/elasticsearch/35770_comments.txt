Since this is an EOL version of Elasticsearch and also because from the cluster configuration you describe this sounds more like a configuration problem than a bug, your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
