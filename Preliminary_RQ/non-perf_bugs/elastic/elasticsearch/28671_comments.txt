Furthermore, `RestoreSnapshotRequest` allows to rename indices when restoring them, so this means that the request may affect a completely different index than what's specified in the `indices` array. We feel that, due to this semantic difference, adding the `IndicesRequest` interface to `RestoreSnapshotRequest` would be misleading. Plugins need to treat this request type with special care, and we think that it would be dangerous to just treat it as any other request that implements `IndicesRequest`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/376512290","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28671#issuecomment-376512290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28671","id":376512290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjUxMjI5MA==","user":{"login":"sscarduzio","id":1327189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjcxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1327189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sscarduzio","html_url":"https://github.com/sscarduzio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sscarduzio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sscarduzio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sscarduzio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sscarduzio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sscarduzio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sscarduzio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sscarduzio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sscarduzio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sscarduzio/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-27T12:48:48Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T12:48:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, makes sense thanks guys for taking a look at this.
