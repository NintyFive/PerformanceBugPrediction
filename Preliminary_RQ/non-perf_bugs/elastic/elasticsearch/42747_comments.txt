We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Would be great if you could also provide the\r\nmappings for those indices.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
