The xContent output of `InternalStats` writes formatted \"as_string\"-fields for \r\nall calculated statistics (min/max/avg/sum) except for the count. Using the Java API and `getCountAsString()` (which is also\r\npart of the `Stats` interface) however, it is possible to retrieve a formatted value that uses the configured formatter \r\n(e.g. a decimal or date formatter).\r\n\r\nIt would be good to either make this consitent by either adding the `count_as_string` output to rest or change `getCountAsString()` so it \r\ndoesn't use the formatter and instead only returns the long as a string. Another option, at least for the parsing in #24239, would be to\r\nremove `getCountAsString()` from the `Stats` interface.\r\n\r\nRelates to #24239 \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
