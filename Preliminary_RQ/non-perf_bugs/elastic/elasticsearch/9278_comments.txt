@grmblfrz \n\nThanks for spotting this.  \n\n> (though I personally would prefer to change the implementation - then 'Flyod' would match 'Floyd' with fuzziness 'AUTO', now I'm needing fuzziness 2)\n\nActually, you can set `fuzzy_transpositions` to `true`, which will mean that swapping `yo` is a single step:\n\n```\nDELETE t\n\nPUT /t/t/1\n{\n  \"text\": \"Floyd\"\n}\n\nGET /_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"text\": {\n        \"query\": \"flyod\",\n        \"fuzziness\": 1,\n        \"fuzzy_transpositions\": true\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo I wonder if the right thing is to change the cutoff from 5 to 4, or to default to fuzzy transpositions?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/70146588","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9278#issuecomment-70146588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9278","id":70146588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTQ2NTg4","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-15T19:33:16Z","updated_at":"2015-01-15T19:33:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mikemccand
