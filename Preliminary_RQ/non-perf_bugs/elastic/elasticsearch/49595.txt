However, one thing that `span` queries support and `intervals` doesn't is fuzziness. Since the `intervals` query is supposed to help in legal and patent search, I have a hard time understanding how this could be possible without fuzziness support. \r\n\r\nI could not find much information about that when browsing the [Github](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/36135) [issues](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29636). Is there any reason why the `intervals` query doesn't support fuzziness? (because [Lucene doesn't](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8284) maybe)? Is it on the roadmap?\r\n\r\nQuoting @jimczi who suggested to open a new issue so that this new feature request could be discussed:\r\n\r\n> I think it's worth opening an issue in Elasticsearch and we'll discuss where the support should land (Elasticsearch or Lucene). As @Mikhail_Khludnev suggested it should be easy to make fuzzy intervals in Elasticsearch using the MultiTermIntervalsSource except that it is not exposed :wink:. Queries that need to check positions cannot handle large number of multi-terms so we have some logic to restrict to those that expand to less than a provided threshold (bounded to 1024). With this protection in place I don't see why we should not expose them more simply in Lucene.\r\n\r\nThe floor is yours, guys!","closed_by":{"login":"romseygeek","id":1347065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDcwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1347065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek","html_url":"https://github.com/romseygeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
