Ideally adding an option of `ignore_missing` or similar would exist and would default to true so that way for the majority of users it just works. The `ignore_failure` option would not work in this scenario because we would still want to fail in the situation where there was a parse error or other unknown error that happened.\n\nThis can be illustrated with the very common/poster-child example of apache log data where we would have the equivalent Logstash config in an ingest node pipeline:\n\n```\nPUT _ingest/pipeline/apachelogs\n{\n  \"description\": \"Pipeline to parse Apache logs\",\n  \"processors\": [\n    {\n      \"grok\": {\n        \"field\": \"message\",\n        \"patterns\": [\n          \"%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"date\": {\n        \"field\": \"timestamp\",\n        \"target_field\": \"timestamp\",\n        \"formats\": [\n          \"dd/MMM/YYYY:HH:mm:ss Z\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"convert\": {\n        \"field\": \"response\",\n        \"type\": \"integer\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"convert\": {\n        \"field\": \"bytes\",\n        \"type\": \"integer\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this situation `bytes` is optional and not present in the case of HEAD/OPTIONS/DELETE requests. If the `bytes` field is not present ideally the pipeline should still work for an end user. See related https://github.com/elastic/beats/issues/2229 for original discovery and background information.\n\nCC @talevy as talked briefly about it earlier this morning\n","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
