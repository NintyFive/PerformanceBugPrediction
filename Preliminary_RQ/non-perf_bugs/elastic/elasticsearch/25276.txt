This should be allowed in the same way when we query the local cluster index name without specifying the cluster name in the index name.\r\n\r\nGET /filebeat-2017.06.*/log/_search  ==> Works & reurns events even though used wildchar in the index name\r\n\r\nGET /remote_cluster:filebeat-2017.06.16/log/_search ==>  Returns events as this has complete index name\r\n\r\nGET /remote_cluster:filebeat-2017.06.*/log/_search ==>  DOESN'T return events as the index name has wildchar\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1. Configure ES with remote cluster as per Cross Cluster Search config\r\n 2. Query the index name with and without wildchar in the  index name from the remote cluster\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
