In the JSON response a status code of 400 is specified and the HTTP status code is 200.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: The HTTP status code is also 400. When indexing data, we don't want to deserialize the response as it's more a fire and forget call. Response gets deserialized only when something went wrong.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nBulk index one or more doc in an index containing invalid character such as `, \\\", *, \\\\, <, |, ,, >, /, ?`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
