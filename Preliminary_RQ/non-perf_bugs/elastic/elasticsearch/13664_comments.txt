No way around it.  What you should do though is to figure out what is causing the OOM and fix that.  The place to get help for that is the forum: http://discuss.elastic.co/.

I also realized that discuss.elastic.co is a better place for such questions. I will post future questions there. At the time I came out with this question, discuss.elastic.co was unavailable (maybe it was taken offline for maintenance). I experience that quite frequently in China during day time (which is roughly night time in the western countries)\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
