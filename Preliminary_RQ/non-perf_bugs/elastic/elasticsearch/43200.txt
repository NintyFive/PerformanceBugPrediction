Doing this for all kinds of randomized query builder\r\nparametrizations requires sometimes non-trivial edge-case handling in either the query builder generation code\r\nor the utility code that codifies assumtions about whether this particular configuration of a builder should be cached\r\nor not (currently implemented on a test-by-test basis by overwriting isCachable()). \r\n\r\nThis has two drawbacks: \r\n\r\n- the \"isCachable()\" code can get quite complex even if the non-caching case is the exception\r\n- we might only rarely check the context cacheable flag because we only run into those cases accidentally\r\n\r\nInstead we should probably remove the cache-flag checks from `AbstractQueryTestCase#testToQuery` and add dedicated,\r\nmore controlled tests for the query builders that need them.","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
