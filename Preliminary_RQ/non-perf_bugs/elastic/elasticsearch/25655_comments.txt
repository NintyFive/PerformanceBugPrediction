You're trying to start Elasticsearch, it thinks its config file should be in `/usr/share/elasticsearch/config` and there is nothing there. This often happens when users install Elasticsearch via a package distribution and try to start Elasticsearch from the command line (`/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch`) instead of via the service. Rather, the package distributions are not meant to be started like this, their configuration is in `/etc/elasticsearch` by default and you should start them via the service.\r\n\r\nWe reserve GitHub for verified bug reports and feature requests, this looks like you just need help and not a bug. For that we would like to ask you to use the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co). I hope you don't mind that I close this then. You can feel free to provide a link here to any topics that you open on the forum.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
