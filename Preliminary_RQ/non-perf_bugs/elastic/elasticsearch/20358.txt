But nothing return. After some researching, I thought the problem was: python timestamp `int(time.time())` is 10 digit, but it is 13 digit in elasticsearch , [official example](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-timestamp-field.html) :\n\n> PUT my_index/my_type/2?timestamp=1420070400000.\n\nso I tried to update the update_time field by multiple 1000:\n\n```\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"inline\": \"ctx._source.update_time=ctx._source.update_time*1000\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUnfortunately, I found all `update_time` become minus. Then I come up with that Java int type is `pow(2,32) -1` , much lower than `1420070400000`.  I guess timestamp field should not be int ? If it is,  the document should  add this tip.\n\nSo I want to update the field value from int to string(I don't want ot change field mapping type, I know change mapping type need reindex, but here only need change value )\n\nBut I can't figure out what script I can use, official script document not mention about this\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
