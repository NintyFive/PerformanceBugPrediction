It's not constantly happening (I assume it is related a bit to the exact time you send it), but it happened reliable enough to reproduce it always within max. 1 minute trying.\r\n\r\nI just used the following request (after injecting the Kibana Flight sample data set):\r\n\r\n```json\r\nGET kibana_sample_data_flights/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"size\": 0, \r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"range\": {\r\n      \"timestamp\": {\r\n        \"gte\": \"now-20m\",\r\n        \"lte\": \"now\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"aggs\": {\r\n    \"foo\": {\r\n      \"auto_date_histogram\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"timestamp\",\r\n        \"buckets\": 1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request returned the following response:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"took\" : 1,\r\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\r\n  \"_shards\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 1,\r\n    \"successful\" : 1,\r\n    \"skipped\" : 0,\r\n    \"failed\" : 0\r\n  },\r\n  \"hits\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : {\r\n      \"value\" : 4,\r\n      \"relation\" : \"eq\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"max_score\" : null,\r\n    \"hits\" : [ ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"aggregations\" : {\r\n    \"foo\" : {\r\n      \"buckets\" : [\r\n        {\r\n          \"key_as_string\" : \"2019-06-25T11:14:00.000Z\",\r\n          \"key\" : 1561461240000,\r\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"key_as_string\" : \"2019-06-25T11:24:00.000Z\",\r\n          \"key\" : 1561461840000,\r\n          \"doc_count\" : 3\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"interval\" : \"10m\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see even though we specified, we need 1 bucket, it generated 2 buckets for us. When playing around with the overall filter it seems that behavior never triggered for me once I had a timerange larger than 30 minutes, but was able to reproduce it rather often with time ranges below 30 minutes (wasn't linked to exactly 20 minutes time range). I tested this mainly on `master`. I was also not able to reproduce that behavior if I didn't use `now` as the upper bound but tried something like `now-1440m` to `now-1420m`.\r\n\r\ncc @polyfractal ","closed_by":{"login":"pcsanwald","id":163306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/163306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald","html_url":"https://github.com/pcsanwald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
