Supports both multicast and unicast discoveries with pluggable support (for simpler cloud integrations).\n\nBy default, the multicast discovery is enabled. Multicast settings:\n\n```\n# discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: Is multicast discovery enabled. Defaults to `true`.\n# discovery.zen.ping.multicast.address: The IP address to send the multicast packets on.\n# discovery.zen.ping.multicast.port: The port to send the packets on. Defaults to `54328`.\n# discovery.zen.ping.multicast.group: The multicast group address. Defaults to `224.2.2.4`.\n# discovery.zen.ping.multicast.ttl: The packet time to live. Defaults to `3`.\n```\n\nThe unicast discovery allows to perform discovery when multicast is disabled. Settings:\n\n```\n# discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: Array of hosts to ping. By setting it, it will automatically enabled multicast.\n```\n\nSample unicast setting:\n\n```\ndiscovery:\n  zen.ping:\n    multicast.enabled: false\n    unicast.hosts:\n      - 192.168.10.21:9300\n      - 192.168.10.22:9301\n      - 192.168.10.23:9302\n      - 192.168.10.24:9303\n```\n\nThere are more global settings that can be set, including:\n\n```\n# discovery.zen.master: Should this node be allowed to be a master in the cluster. Defaults to `true`. Note, when `node.client` is set to `true`, it will automatically set this setting to `false`.\n# discovery.zen.initial_ping_timeout: The initial ping timeout to wait for discovery of other nodes. Defaults to `3s`.\n```\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
