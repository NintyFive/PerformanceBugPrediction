you are filing a feature request, please remove the above bug\r\nreport block and provide responses for all of the below items.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the feature**:\r\n\r\nMy wishlist for painless Painless development: a command line tool to load a painless script and contexts, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun-painless --script my-script.painless --context /path/to/context-files\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `--context` could be a single file or directory containing multiple files.\r\nA context file would be a json document which could (for example to simulate a watch) could have something like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"ctx\":{\r\n    \"payload\":{\r\n      \"size\":5\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n... or obviously much much more complex...\r\n\r\nOnce started, the tool would allow you to run again and again (reducing the JVM load time), each time reading the script and context files anew.\r\n\r\nFor bonus points the execution time for each of the contexts, and a summary for all of the contexts together would be very useful for optimising scripts.","closed_by":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
