The core is intended to be like a kernel.  Features are added as primitives which can be used by applications built on top of core.\r\n\r\nFor instance the rollover and shrink APIs are primitives which allow index management tools to be added by an application, which also knows about scheduling and how to notify users when things go wrong.\r\n\r\nAs @jasontedor has said you should take a look at Curator.  We won't add this feature to core.  If we do add something like this, it'll be in X-Pack which builds on top of core.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
