This ambiguity has been cleared up in 2.x (see #8870) but cannot be resolved in 1.x.\n\nYou can try prepending the type name to to disambiguate: `web-api.time` vs `web-api.event.time`\n\n(Prepending the type name is no longer supported in 2.x because it creates other ambiguities, but should work for your case).\n\ni highly recommend upgrading.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/190128603","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16849#issuecomment-190128603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16849","id":190128603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDEyODYwMw==","user":{"login":"ofer-velich","id":7073481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzM0ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7073481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofer-velich","html_url":"https://github.com/ofer-velich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofer-velich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofer-velich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofer-velich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofer-velich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofer-velich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofer-velich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofer-velich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofer-velich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofer-velich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-29T09:49:26Z","updated_at":"2016-02-29T09:49:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks! \nWe are currently upgrading our clusters to 2.X.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
