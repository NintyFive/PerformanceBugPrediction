https://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+6.4+bwc-tests/6/console\r\n\r\nThen problem is that the regex expects milliseconds but the output only contains seconds.\r\n\r\nThis does not reproduce easily.  However, by making the following edit the problem will reproduce 50% of the time (presumably because it's a mixed cluster and the code edit only applies to one version):\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- a/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/rest/action/cat/RestIndicesAction.java\r\n+++ b/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/rest/action/cat/RestIndicesAction.java\r\n@@ -380,7 +380,7 @@ public class RestIndicesAction extends AbstractCatAction {\r\n             table.addCell(primaryStats.getDocs() == null ? null : primaryStats.getDocs().getDeleted());\r\n \r\n             table.addCell(indexMetaData.getCreationDate());\r\n-            table.addCell(ZonedDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.ofEpochMilli(indexMetaData.getCreationDate()), ZoneOffset.UTC));\r\n+            table.addCell(ZonedDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.ofEpochSecond(indexMetaData.getCreationDate() / 1000L), ZoneOffset.UTC));\r\n \r\n             table.addCell(totalStats.getStore() == null ? null : totalStats.getStore().size());\r\n             table.addCell(primaryStats.getStore() == null ? null : primaryStats.getStore().size());\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the problem is that `ZonedDateTime.toString()` does not output milliseconds if the time it's storing is an exact number of seconds.\r\n\r\nI suspect this problem is new to 6.4 due to the Joda to Java time migration.","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
