Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
