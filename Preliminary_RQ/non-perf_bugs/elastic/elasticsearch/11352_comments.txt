It also means that people can open examples directly in a console where they can run them, as opposed to having to copy to a text file and paste one by one.\n\nPlus there are a number of things on the go:\n- sense will be able to translate multiple curl statements to sense syntax on paste\n- sense will be able to copy multiple statements as curl\n- sense will be able to run multiple curl statements in sequence\n\nOnce we have the second point implemented, we can look at adding a copy-as-curl button to the code blocks on the website.\n\n> Even if sense were open source it'd be weird to tell people that they have to file bugs with curl but give them documentation in sense.\n\nI much prefer bugs filed in sense syntax.
