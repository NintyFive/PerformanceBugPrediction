\r\n5.2.1\r\n\r\n**JVM version**:\r\njava version \"1.8.0_131\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_131-b11)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.131-b11, mixed mode)\r\n\r\n**OS version** :\r\nWindows 7\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\nIn my use case I have a set of questions indexed in elastic and let the user enter a question and I want to find the best matching questions from elastic. \r\nThere are some questions that distinguish in only one word (for example _\"Which options do I have for the deductible height with a __partially__ comprehensive insurance?\"_ vs _\"Which options do I have for the deductible height with a __fully__ comprehensive insurance\"_). <br>\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\nWhen the user now enters a question that is already in Elastic I expect it to yield this question as best match\r\n\r\n**Actual**\r\nElastic yields another question rather than the exact match. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nCreate fresh test index\r\n\r\n    curl -XDELETE \"http://localhost:9200/foo\"\r\n    curl -XPUT \"http://localhost:9200/foo\"\r\n\r\nDefine mapping\r\n\r\n    curl -XPUT \"http://localhost:9200/foo/_mapping/foo\" -d'\r\n    {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"content\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"text\", \r\n          \"analyzer\": \"english\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }'\r\n\r\nIndex documents with two being very similar (The document being indexed last always has a lower score than the document being indexed second last)\r\n\r\n    curl -XPOST \"http://localhost:9200/_bulk?refresh\" -d'\r\n    { \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"foo\", \"_type\" : \"foo\", \"_id\" : \"1\" } }\r\n    { \"content\": \"What is the difference between a fully comprehensive insurance and a partially comprehensive insurance?\" }\r\n    { \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"foo\", \"_type\" : \"foo\", \"_id\" : \"2\" } }\r\n    { \"content\": \"Which options do I have for the deductible height with a fully comprehensive insurance\" }\r\n    { \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"foo\", \"_type\" : \"foo\", \"_id\" : \"3\" } }\r\n    { \"content\": \"Which options do I have for the deductible height with a partially comprehensive insurance\" }\r\n    '\r\n\r\nquery with `match` for the last indexed document.\r\nThe same would happen if I only search for important terms `deductible height partially comprehensive insurance`\r\n\r\n    curl -XGET \"http://localhost:9200/foo/_search\" -d'\r\n    {\r\n      \"query\": {\r\n        \"match\": {\r\n          \"content\": {\r\n            \"query\": \"Which options do I have for the deductible height with a partially comprehensive insurance\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }  \r\n    }'\r\n\r\nResult (Note how the almost identical question has a much higher score than the identical one).\r\n\r\n    \"hits\": {\r\n        \"total\": 3,\r\n        \"max_score\": 5.055572,\r\n        \"hits\": [\r\n
