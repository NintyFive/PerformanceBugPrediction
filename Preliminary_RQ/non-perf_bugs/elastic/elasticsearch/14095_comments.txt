One issue however is that this metric is optional, some codecs might not store it. And also it wouldn't work if a field is mapped with doc values only.\n\nAlternatively, monitoring tools could iterate over fields in the mapping and count how many documents contain this field using the `exists` query, which would work for any field that is either indexed or has doc values enabled.\n\nHowever I'm not sure this is something that could be run on a regular basis as it might be costly if you have many shards or fields, so I think there should be a button in the monitoring UI to run such checks explicitly.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/176765282","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14095#issuecomment-176765282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14095","id":176765282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Njc2NTI4Mg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-29T13:57:46Z","updated_at":"2016-01-29T13:57:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This sounds like an aggregation with an exists filter per field which can be run by Marvel.
