Some of them are very important building blocks while other ones are only useful for esoteric use-cases or have known issues. Keeping the core small is important for a variety of reasons so maybe we should consider creating a new elasticsearch-extra plugin, with a best-effort only backward compatibility policy, which would contain such esoteric features.\n\nSome ideas of what could move from core to such a plugin:\n- the `token_count` field mapper (esoteric)\n- the `murmur3` field mapper (not really needed)\n- the `fuzzy_like_this` query (super costly + esoteric)\n- the `top_children` query (questionable approximation)\n- the `significant_terms` aggregation (scalability issues on large data)\n- the `scripted_metric` aggregation (useful for experimentation but hard to use and slow)\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
