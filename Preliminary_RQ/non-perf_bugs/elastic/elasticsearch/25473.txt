Dynamic mapping should not be necessary here in my opinion.\r\nAlso running the following:\r\n```\r\nPOST _scripts/groovy/indexedCalculateScore\r\n{\r\n  \"lang\": \"groovy\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nresults in\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"error\": {\r\n      \"root_cause\": [\r\n         {\r\n            \"type\": \"script_parse_exception\",\r\n            \"reason\": \"expected one of [inline], [file] or [id] fields, but found none\"\r\n         }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"type\": \"script_parse_exception\",\r\n      \"reason\": \"expected one of [inline], [file] or [id] fields, but found none\"\r\n   },\r\n   \"status\": 500\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut when I specify a one of those fields, lets say id:\r\n```\r\nPOST _scripts/groovy/indexedCalculateScore\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"test\",\r\n  \"lang\": \"groovy\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nit results in\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"error\": {\r\n      \"root_cause\": [\r\n         {\r\n            \"type\": \"strict_dynamic_mapping_exception\",\r\n            \"reason\": \"mapping set to strict, dynamic introduction of [id] within [groovy] is not allowed\"\r\n         }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"type\": \"strict_dynamic_mapping_exception\",\r\n      \"reason\": \"mapping set to strict, dynamic introduction of [id] within [groovy] is not allowed\"\r\n   },\r\n   \"status\": 400\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. I think the error message is wrong.\r\n3. Also there is an error in the 2.4 [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/modules-scripting.html): in some places the index is called `.scripts` and in other `_scripts`.","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
