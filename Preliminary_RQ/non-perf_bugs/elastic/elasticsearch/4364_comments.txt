It probably enables desired functionality but on a rather low level\n1. translation of payloads to boosts ideally would be done as part of the regular boost implementation so it meshes well with regular boost\n2. Ability to strip payload data from the submitted data. When I fetch _source  I would not want payload data in it I would much rather have \"the quick fox\" than \"the|1 quick|2 fox|3\"\n3. In order to add payload to each individual term I would need to know how it will be tokenized. I would much rather associate the boost with a text fragment and let ES to tokenize the fragment and associate the payload with each token in the fragment\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/50127503","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4364#issuecomment-50127503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4364","id":50127503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTI3NTAz","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T09:29:17Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T09:29:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After discussing this we have decided not to take this issue any further, It makes more sense to split the more important spans of text into separate fields, and to boost those fields.
