think the problem here is these two lines of the init script:\n- [start-stop-daemon is given `-b`

flag](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/distribution/deb/src/main/packaging/init.d/elasticsearch#L82)\n\nGiven the above, I think Elasticsearch is backgrounding itself (`elasticsearch -d`) and `start-stop-daemon` is also forking, so I _think_ start-stop-daemon is tracking the pid of the parent Elasticsearch process which immediately dies after Elasticsearch daemonizes.\n\nMy suggestion is that one of the two things are changed:\n- Don't give `-b` to start-stop-daemon\n- or, don't give `-d` to
