The mapping code is seriously complex and prone to bugs.  You just need to search for all the issues labelled `:Mapping` to get an idea of problematic they have been.  For this reason, I'm loathe to add further complexity.  \n\nFor instance, possibly the most obvious way of adding field aliases would be to add a field of type `alias`, which points to the real field.  But now you want to change or remove those aliases.  This is a huge change from the way we deal with mappings today: fields never change type and fields never get removed.  What happens if you index into an alias field? etc etc\n\nI could see field aliases having all sorts of unintended consequences - this is why they concern me.  Yet they are really easy to implement application side.  There are so many other truly useful things that we'd like to add to Elasticsearch - things that can't easily be done in the application - that something like field aliases doesn't make the cut in my opinion.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/206901183","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17511#issuecomment-206901183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17511","id":206901183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjkwMTE4Mw==","user":{"login":"ejsmith","id":282584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjU4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/282584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejsmith","html_url":"https://github.com/ejsmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejsmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejsmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejsmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejsmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejsmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejsmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejsmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejsmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejsmith/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T13:27:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T13:27:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What if aliases were their own feature separate from mapping and were only applied to queries.

I believe that the infromation related to structures are **only** stored in the mapping, hence why if we add this it doesn't make sense to use another structure as it will break the concept of mapping, and why they exist. @clintongormley am i right?\n\nThe good thing about this is that there is an easy workaround: translating this at the app level, you just keep the structure in your end, and if you have an alias `a: a.id` and a query string `a:id_search` you need to translate this into `a.id:id_search`. \n\nAnother complex workaround (i believe), could be creating a small plugin, but that can be tricky since you will need to find your way to store this.\n\nFinally, you could use the [Mapping Metadata](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-meta-field.html) to save this. But then i believe you should load the information at app start time to avoid GET operations only to get this information from the mapping. @clintongormley shouldn't the meta field be an option to store this information about field \"aliases\"?
