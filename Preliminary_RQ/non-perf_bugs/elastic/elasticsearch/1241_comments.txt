So it is usual when some user has data like \"Working since 2002, 09 to till now\", Facebook returning 0000, 00 for \"till now\" values. And when i tried to save the same value in ElasticSearch, It was generating date format exception. That is right, But what is the other way to consider that value till now?. I believe, it should allow such exception in date.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
