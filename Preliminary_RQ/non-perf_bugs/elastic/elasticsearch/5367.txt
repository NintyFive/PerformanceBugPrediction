Relying solely on query parameters imposes an unnecessary restriction on the number and length of the parameters that may be used (due to the restriction of the length of the URI).  POST data has a far greater allowable content size.\n\nConsider the case of clearing index cache keys.  Your documentation suggests something akin to:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/tweets/_cache/clear?filter_keys=user_2_friends'\n```\n\nIf one wanted to clear many filter keys at once, they would necessarily have to submit multiple requests.  What's worse is that the caller has to ensure their URI does not exceed the maximum length and conditionally break up their calls into multiple chunks.\n\nIf the POST data was also checked for the parameters, then the user could essentially clear as many keys as they wanted while only making one HTTP request.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
