I have it behind an apache basic auth to protect it. I can telnet from my workstation to the elasticsearch port.\n\nIf I access Kibana over HTTP, it works wonderfully :-) BUT if I switch to HTTPS it fails miserably. The logs from within the JS are not very helpful, so it took a bit of tracking down.\n\nSo my problem is that I cannot use HTTPS for Kibana and HTTP for Kibana => elasticsearch. Is that an intended dependency between them?\n","closed_by":{"login":"rashidkpc","id":1250387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1250387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashidkpc","html_url":"https://github.com/rashidkpc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashidkpc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashidkpc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashidkpc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashidkpc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashidkpc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashidkpc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashidkpc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashidkpc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rashidkpc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
