If the values are sent in the original request as unix milliseconds, they are echo'd back having not been transformed.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of consistency the .NET client has implemented both the request and response parsing using unix milliseconds - it may be worth updating the specification and documentation to point the user towards doing the same.
