I think we should add a follow info api. Which returns all the follower indices and for each follower index returns the status (active or paused) and index follow parameters. Then we can leave the follow stats api as is. The structure of the response of the follow info api would then look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"indices\": {\r\n        {\r\n            \"index\": \"follower_index1\",\r\n            \"status\": \"active\",\r\n            \"parameters\": {\r\n                 \"remote_cluster\": \"eu_cluster\",\r\n                  \"leader_index\": \"leader_index1\",\r\n                  \"max_read_request_operation_count\": 1024,\r\n                  ...\r\n             }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n           \"index\": \"follower_index2\",\r\n           ...\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/453499631","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37127#issuecomment-453499631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37127","id":453499631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzQ5OTYzMQ==","user":{"login":"yaronp68","id":1367657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjc2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1367657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68","html_url":"https://github.com/yaronp68","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-11T12:17:21Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T12:17:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@martijnvg The separate list of follower indices API you mention will be very useful for the user IMO\r\nIn the GUI we will be able to use it for creating a list of followers with the dynamic information we need without hitting the stats API all the time\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/453503949","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37127#issuecomment-453503949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37127","id":453503949,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzUwMzk0OQ==","user":{"login":"sebelga","id":2854616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTQ2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2854616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebelga","html_url":"https://github.com/sebelga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebelga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebelga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebelga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebelga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebelga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebelga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebelga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebelga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebelga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-11T12:36:42Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T12:36:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed @martijnvg .
