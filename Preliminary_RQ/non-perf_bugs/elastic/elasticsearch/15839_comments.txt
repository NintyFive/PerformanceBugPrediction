Instead, I think the scripted approach (in combination with filters) is the correct one.\n\nUpdate scripts should be written to take parallel changes into account, eg:\n\n```\nif (ctx._source.name == 'Jon') {\n    ctx._source.name = 'John'\n}\n```\n\nThis can be rerun with a filter on name == 'Jon', but the logic depends entirely on how the application should behave.  Providing just one rigid way of doing this would be insufficient and, I think, confusing.\n\n> As a reindex job is running, you can track it's progress simply by writing a filtered query to see how many documents have that ID on it.\n\nStatus can already be tracked via task mgmt.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
