(See https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/11791 for a similar issue that we're in the process of fixing). \n\nYou can already use aliases with the indices stats API, which solves the problem by using structured output. Alternatively, you can use:\n\n```\nGET _cat/indices/{alias_name}\n```\n\nwhich will give you the data you're after for all of the associated indices.  I think that this already serves the purpose.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
