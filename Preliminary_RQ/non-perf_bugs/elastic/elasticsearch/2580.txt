The opportunity should be the union queries on the sql data type. There are 2 tables with data, can you bring in one thread a result of the 2 tables? thus creating aliases and structure of the tables is different\nExample:\n\nThe first table(tovar)\nid\nname\ncategories_id\nbarcode\n\nThe second table(prices)\nprice_id\ncategories_id\ntovar_id\nprice\n\n1) Need to do a search on tovar and the name field\nSELECT id FROM table1 WHERE MATCH('search')\n2) Attach the recording with prices and specify conditions for tovar_id\nSELECT price_id, tovar_id, barcode FROM table1, prices WHERE MATCH('search') and categories_id IN (2,3,4) GRIUP BY tovar_id ORDER BY price\n\nThis is an example of the request as if it worked, I need to bring up those records which are in table prices on tovar_id and sort them, if no entries in the prices_id down, this is the problem I solved by checking the existence of the field\n\nSELECT price_id, tovar_id, barcode, EXIST('price', 99999999.99) as suma_sort FROM table1, prices WHERE MATCH('search') and categories_id IN (2,3,4) GRIUP BY tovar_id ORDER BY ASC suma_sort\n\nIf there are no fields price the value of suma_sort will be 99999999.99 and then sort. And also the opportunity to sample the offset limit\n\nSELECT price_id, tovar_id, barcode, EXIST('price', 99999999.99) as suma_sort FROM table1, prices WHERE MATCH('search') and categories_id IN (2,3,4) GRIUP BY tovar_id ORDER BY suma_sort ASC LIMIT 0,20 for the implementation of the paging output.\n\nI would like to know if I can do it in elasticsearch.
