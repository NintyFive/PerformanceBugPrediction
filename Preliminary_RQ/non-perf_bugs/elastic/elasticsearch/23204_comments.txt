On the other hand, we have been striving to not use libraries that use JNI bindings or Java's `sun.misc.Unsafe` in order to keep troubleshooting easy. Overall this has more cons than pros to me. If compressing snapshots is what you are after, maybe another way to make it work would be to enable compression on the volume that store the snapshots at the filesystem level.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/280352761","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23204#issuecomment-280352761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23204","id":280352761,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDM1Mjc2MQ==","user":{"login":"Cornoualis","id":379309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTMwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/379309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cornoualis","html_url":"https://github.com/Cornoualis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cornoualis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cornoualis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cornoualis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cornoualis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cornoualis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cornoualis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cornoualis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cornoualis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cornoualis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-16T14:56:56Z","updated_at":"2017-02-16T14:56:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Salut and thank you for your answer!\r\nI understand what you mean.
