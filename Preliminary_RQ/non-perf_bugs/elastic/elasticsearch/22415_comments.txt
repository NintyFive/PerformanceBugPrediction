You have to set `path.shared_data` to a path on the filesystem under which the per index directories are created ie. `/opt/customer_indices`  then you can create an index with `index.data_path: /opt/customer_indices/customer_1` and it will create the index directory in `/opt/customer_indices/customer_1`. This is part of the shadow replica [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.1/indices-shadow-replicas.html) but you don't need shadow replicas for this at all. the `path.shared_data` is required to enable the security manager to grant permissions for write access to this directory.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/270331359","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22415#issuecomment-270331359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22415","id":270331359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDMzMTM1OQ==","user":{"login":"rkalhans","id":5341933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDE5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5341933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans","html_url":"https://github.com/rkalhans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T09:41:06Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T09:41:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"cool. this works.
