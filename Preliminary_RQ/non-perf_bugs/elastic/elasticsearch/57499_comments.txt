These APIs just overwrite the previous versions.\r\nElasticsearch has APIs that do partial updates (iirc update mapping api is the only one) but it requires a lot of work to build such APIs and are usually built for a specific reason other than being handy. \r\n\r\nI agree that being able to support partial config is handy, but if we do this for index templates then we need to do it as well for other types of config (ilm policy, ingest pipeline, security roles etc.) in order to be consistent. I will close this issue, because I don't see time being spent on developing these partial update apis in the foreseeable future. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
