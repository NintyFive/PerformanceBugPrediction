A noble goal. I certainly empathize with these users.\n\nThe opposition argued that experience is quickly gained, and experienced users want the non-verbose behavior, such that over time the majority of users will become frustrated with the new, verbose default.\n\nDespite my empathy for new users, I 100% agree with the opposition. I'd also like to point out that this is an api specifically designed for scripting (see its [introduction](https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-cat-api)) and every script that uses it will break in unpredictable ways when the behavior changes. Changing the default will generate a lot of unpleasant work and delay upgrades to 2.0.\n\nThe argument that every script should have used `v=false` to protect against future breakage is particularly galling, since this usage was undocumented. It demonstrates a cavalier attitude toward breaking changes that doesn't inspire trust.\n\nBreaking changes, especially breaking changes in APIs (_cat is definitely an API) should only be considered when the original behavior was fundamentally broken. That isn't the case here.\n\nA command-line, user-friendly state inspection tool would be very useful, but _cat is not that tool. Wow your users with a top-like dashboard shipped with the distribution. Don't discourage them by changing the _cat default.\n\n/cc @dakrone @drewr @TwP\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
