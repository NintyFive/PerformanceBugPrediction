For example, I have work, home, and favourite breakfast cafe. I'd like to find people who hang out near any of those places. Right now I should fire as many queries, as many points of interest I have, and then I need to merge results outside of elasticsearch. Having ability to use single query for this.\n\nLooks like it could be quite trivial change, an extra loop to iterate requested points. I might be wrong about this.\n\nI understand, that it could be very cpu intensive for querying with many points, but the point here is to use small amount of points.\n","closed_by":{"login":"brwe","id":4320215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjAyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4320215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe","html_url":"https://github.com/brwe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
