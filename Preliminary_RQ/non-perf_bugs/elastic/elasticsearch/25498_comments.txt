I do not think the two tests interfered with each other as they use separate temporary directories and independent loggers. I did push fe04b666ea36a428d5ac174ccf72db9924744658 so that we can see the actual logging here in case this occurs again. I'm going to close this for now, if we see this occur again I will take a deeper look.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/322357779","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25498#issuecomment-322357779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25498","id":322357779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjM1Nzc3OQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-15T02:09:27Z","updated_at":"2017-08-15T02:11:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This one did not reproduce because it relied on *another* test running the same JVM *before* the failing test here.
