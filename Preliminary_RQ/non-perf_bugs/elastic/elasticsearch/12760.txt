I'm wondering if this is something we would like to implement whatever the repository type is.\n\nI can imagine something like:\n\n``` json\n// Create a first repo\nPUT /_snapshot/repo_fs\n{\n  \"type\": \"fs\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"location\": \"/mount/backups/my_backup\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a second repo\nPUT /_snapshot/repo_azure\n{\n  \"type\": \"azure\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"key\": \"my_key\",\n    \"secret\": \"secret\"\n  },\n  \"secondary\": \"repo_fs\"\n}\n```\n\nSo when we try to backup or restore to/from `repo_azure` if it fails, we try then `repo_fs`.\n\n@imotov WDYT? Would this make sense to support what was asked in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-cloud-azure/pull/93 but whatever the repositories are?\n\nMay be it's better to do this retry on a client level instead?\n\nThoughts?\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
