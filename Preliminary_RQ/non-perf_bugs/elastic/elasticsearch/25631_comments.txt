When you create an index when there are only 5.5.0 nodes it the cluster, the master can use 5.5.0 only features exposing them to the users - which is the whole point of the upgrade. From then on, we can't allow <5.5.0 nodes to join because they may not understand what they get. I see that this can also result in a problem if it happens unexpectedly during an upgrade but I think the right move here is to push through with the upgrade bringing the all nodes to use the 5.5.0 version and let them join. This a *much* simpler solution for this relatively rare issue. I'm going to close the issue.. feel free to respond.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
