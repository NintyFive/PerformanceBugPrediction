So you are comparing `No idea` with the inverted index which has `no` and `idea` because your field is analyzed by default. And that does not match.\n\nIt's absolutely not related to field naming.\n\nWe can discuss this on the mailing list. You should also check analysis chapter in elasticsearch guide.\n\nClosing as it's not an issue. Feel free to reopen if you think I'm wrong.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
