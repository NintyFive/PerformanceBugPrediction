Note that if you run the same call on any other node in the cluster apart from the tribe node, you'll see the same nodes apart from the tribe node itself, as that one doesn't really join the cluster.\n\nOn the other hand nodes info and stats actually connect to all nodes in the cluster to gather information, and a client node cannot at the moment cannot to another client node as explained in #16815. Closing in favour of #16815.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
