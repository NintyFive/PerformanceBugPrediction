Tokens were not stored until some point in 6.x and would only exist in the index if they were invalidated; in later versions all tokens are stored so the logic for invalidation has two different branches.\r\n\r\nFor 7.0, we can remove this backwards compatibility which will simplify the TokenService invalidation and ultimately reduce the amount of code as we should only need to rely on behavior from 6.7 on except for the case where a user upgrades from pre 6.2 to 6.7 and then on to 7 within a day. In that case, maybe we can refuse to accept any token prior to 6.7. At worst this means the user needs to re-authenticate.","closed_by":{"login":"jkakavas","id":10281256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgxMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10281256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas","html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
