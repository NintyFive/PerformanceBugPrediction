The date component is parsed using: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/time/DateFormatters.java#L61\r\nAs an outcome, the `strict_optional_time` would fail to parse the values with < 4 digit numbers and they will fallback to the `epoch_second` parser which will parse them correctly as +/- seconds from the EPOCH timestamp. It will also successfully parse the negative values with >=4 digits as a year only value since month and day parts are optional. Moreover the `strict_optional_time` will fail to parse positive values with > 4 digits as that would require the `+` sign in front of them as the `SignStyle.EXCEEDS_PAD` is used. That is why the `-10000` is parsed as the year -10000 but the `10000` is parsed as seconds.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/575631576","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51080#issuecomment-575631576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51080","id":575631576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTYzMTU3Ng==","user":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-17T13:45:01Z","updated_at":"2020-01-17T13:45:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dvisztempacct\r\n\r\nAs a conclusion, the behaviour you see for this definition of formats for date parsing is the expected one. If you insert numeric only values, then the mapping should define: `\"format\": \"epoch_second\"` only, to avoid this mixup with trying to parse it as a year first.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to be able to insert docs with mixed formats (both numeric and string), then you could just invert the formats in your mapping:\r\n```\r\n\"format\": \"epoch_second||strict_date_optional_time\"\r\n```\r\nAs a side effect though, queries on this index will return the date values of the `foo` field always as epoch_seconds and not as pretty printed date strings, e.g.: `\"1970-01-01T00:01:40.000Z\"`.\r\n\r\nIssue: #51156 has been opened to explicitly define the printed format to overcome this behaviour.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I hope you don't mind closing this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/575631961","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51080#issuecomment-575631961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51080","id":575631961,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTYzMTk2MQ==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-17T13:46:12Z","updated_at":"2020-01-17T13:46:12Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra (:Core/Infra/Core)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/577963458","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51080#issuecomment-577963458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51080","id":577963458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Nzk2MzQ1OA==","user":{"login":"dvisztempacct","id":37460069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDYwMDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/37460069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvisztempacct","html_url":"https://github.com/dvisztempacct","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvisztempacct/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvisztempacct/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvisztempacct/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvisztempacct/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvisztempacct/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvisztempacct/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvisztempacct/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvisztempacct/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvisztempacct/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-24T02:13:50Z","updated_at":"2020-01-24T02:13:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@matriv\r\n\r\n> If you would like to be able to insert docs with mixed formats (both numeric and string), then you could just invert the formats in your mapping:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> \"format\": \"epoch_second||strict_date_optional_time\"\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a great option.\r\n\r\nI think the docs are still a problem, though.
