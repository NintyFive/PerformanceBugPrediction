Start from a fresh ElasticSearch instance\n   \n   ```\n   docker run -d -p 9200:9200 elasticsearch -Des.network.host=0.0.0.0\n   ```\n2. Load some data\n   \n   ```\n   curl -XPUT localhost:9200/test_index -d '{\"settings\": {\"index\" {\"number_of_shards\": 3, \"number_of_replicas\": 0}}}'\n   curl -XPOST localhost:9200/test_index/test_doc -d '{\"content\": \"Buffalo\"}'\n   curl -XPOST localhost:9200/test_index/test_doc -d '{\"content\": \"Buffalo, New York\"}'\n   curl -XPOST localhost:9200/test_index/test_doc -d '{\"content\": \"Canada\"}'\n   ```\n3. Verify normal querying works:\n   \n   ```\n   curl -XGET localhost:9200/test_index/test_doc/_search -d'\n   {\n   \"query\": {\n       \"simple_query_string\": {\n           \"query\": \"Buffalo\"\n       }\n   }\n   }'\n   # The two, correct results are returned\n   ```\n4. Demonstrate queries with the NOT operator don't work:\n   \n   ```\n   {\n   \"query\": {\n       \"simple_query_string\": {\n           \"query\": \"Buffalo -New\"\n       }\n   }\n   }'\n   # Here, all three documents are returned, including one without terms specified in the query.\n   ```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
