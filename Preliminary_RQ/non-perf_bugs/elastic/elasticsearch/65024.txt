The `multi_match` query already supports various types (`most_fields`, `best_fields`, `cross_fields`, `phrase`, etc). The `type` parameter doesn't seem to be fully consistent, though, as `phrase` and `phrase_prefix` only support a `best_fields`, but not a `most_fields` scoring. Thus, for our use case we currently have to generate a `match_phrase` query for each field and wrap them in a `should` clause. Consequently, it would be really conventient to e.g. have a `most_phrase` and `most_phrase_prefix` type (naming is to be TBD).
