The difference between year and year-of-era is that year can have values `<0` for years before the era.\r\n- `x` week-year` in joda should be updated to `Y` in java.time. `x` means zone-offset in java.time.\r\n- ` C century` is no longer supported in java.time\r\n- `Z time zone offset/id` has the same meaning in java.time as it had previously in joda. However it will fail when parsing `Z` in a date. For instance `2019-05-09T14:24:00.000Z` (in Zulu/UTC time) will fail parsing. `X` could be used instead and correctly parse this date.\r\n- `z time zone text` - Will print `Z` for Zulu given UTC timezone. Previously joda was printing UTC for utc timezone. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pgomulka","id":11137008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTM3MDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11137008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka","html_url":"https://github.com/pgomulka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
