This is, however, paramount for sensitive applications, as described in [this blogpost](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/running-groovy-scripts-without-dynamic-scripting/).\n\n@polyfractal has pointed out that the bug is that [`ScoreFunction`](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/1.x/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/functionscore/script/ScriptScoreFunctionParser.java#L80-L84) only uses the default inline `script` argument. It should also accept the `file` argument.\n\nIt would be nice if the `file` argument could be accepted consistently by functions that use inline scripts.
