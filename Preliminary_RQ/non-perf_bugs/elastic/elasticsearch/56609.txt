We should decide on how best to distinguish the old templates vs. the new templates. \r\n\r\nSome references use v1 vs v2 index templates. Some references use legacy vs. 8.0.0 templates. However both of naming conventions may have issues. \r\n\r\nv1 and v2 is sub-versioning within the Elasticsearch version and could be the cause of confusion. Further v2 sounds an evolution of v1 templates, while they serve some of same the purposes they are not really an evolution (i.e. automatic upgrade to v2 is a difficult problem)â€©.
