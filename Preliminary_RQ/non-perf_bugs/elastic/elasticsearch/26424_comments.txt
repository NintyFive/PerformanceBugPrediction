is due to float conversions indeed. For instance the dataset has value `-68683370.7909999937` whose closest float is distant by about 2.8 from its closest double. For the record, please note that `950935544.6046678` is not the correct answer, it is just less incorrect. If you need more accuracy, you can map your field as a `double` rather than `float`. Note however that it will increase storage requirements.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
