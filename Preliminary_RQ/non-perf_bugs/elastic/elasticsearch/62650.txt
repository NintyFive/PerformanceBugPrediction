topic that was raised in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/61883#issuecomment-690281936 is deprecating usage of `=` when doing equality checks.\r\nEQL does use `=` for assignments so using it for equality checks instead of `==` is potentially confusing (is it an assignment or an equality check?).\r\nIt would be good to get some numbers on the usage to see how often this occurs.\r\nBased on that we can decide whether to go with a safe route (deprecation-only with removal later down the road) or straight removal.","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
