This is currently being done via `_nodes/http` and picking the `http_address` (or `https_address`). However, these fields are missing in 5.0.0-alpha5 here. The contents of these fields have been changed from time to time. But they've never been missing entirely. I also cannot find a reference in the docs. Is this a regression or will the method for resolving the HTTP(S) endpoint change in 5.0?\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n\n``` sh\n$ curl -s 'localhost:9200/_nodes/http?pretty'\n{\n  \"_nodes\" : {\n    \"total\" : 1,\n    \"successful\" : 1,\n    \"failed\" : 0\n  },\n  \"cluster_name\" : \"elasticsearch\",\n  \"nodes\" : {\n    \"M8N4pvE2QUmwsci_RdK4cg\" : {\n      \"name\" : \"M8N4pvE\",\n      \"transport_address\" : \"127.0.0.1:9300\",\n      \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\",\n      \"ip\" : \"127.0.0.1\",\n      \"version\" : \"5.0.0-alpha5\",\n      \"build_hash\" : \"d327dd4\",\n      \"roles\" : [\n        \"master\",\n        \"data\",\n        \"ingest\"\n      ],\n      \"http\" : {\n        \"bound_address\" : [\n          \"[::1]:9200\",\n          \"127.0.0.1:9200\",\n          \"172.17.0.2:9200\"\n        ],\n        \"publish_address\" : \"127.0.0.1:9200\",\n        \"max_content_length_in_bytes\" : 104857600\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
