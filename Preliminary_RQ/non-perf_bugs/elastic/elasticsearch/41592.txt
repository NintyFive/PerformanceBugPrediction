 Back-port the documentation updates from [PR #40783](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/40783) to version specific pages.  The reason for this issue is that weâ€™ve updated the `master` docs page of [the Fuzziness section under Match Query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/query-dsl-match-query.html#query-dsl-match-query-fuzziness) which states:\r\n> Note that fuzzy matching is not applied to terms with synonyms, as under the hood these terms are expanded to a special synonym query that blends term frequencies, which does not support fuzzy expansion.\r\n\r\nHowever, this paragraph is **only** in the `master` page, not in any version specific page (i.e., it is not mentioned in the [equivalent 6.2 docs page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/query-dsl-match-query.html#query-dsl-match-query-fuzziness).  With that said, based on [issue #25518](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25518), this appears to be applicable to all versions.","closed_by":{"login":"debadair","id":362578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjU3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/362578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair","html_url":"https://github.com/debadair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
