Please correct me if something wrong with approach or understanding\n\nSteps to reproduce\n1. Create about 50 documents in 50 different indices\n2. Use delete by query api to delete all the documents created above.\n3. Verify if all documents are deleted\n\nExpected: all documents in all indices should be deleted\nActual: Few documents are left over, there is no consistency as to which ones ...\n\nGist \"https://gist.github.com/ssanghavi/8935108\" can help reproduce the issue\n\nAlso tried to delete using \"_all/query\" but even that does not work\nIf I delete documents from each index at a time i.e. loop over, then it works fine\n\nI am using a single node on my desktop\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
