Parents and children need to be indexed on the same shard for the parent-child relationship to work.  This is usually achieved by setting the `parent` parameter when indexing the child, which in effect sets the `routing` parameter for the child.\n\nHowever, your `user` docs are children of the `organization`, so they already have a custom `routing` value.  When you index your `sickness` docs, you are setting the `parent` value, but this no longer contains the correct `routing`. Instead you need to set the `parent=$parent_id` AND `routing=$Grandparent_id`.  That way, related organization, user and sickness docs are all stored on the same shard.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/17832084","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3030#issuecomment-17832084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3030","id":17832084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3ODMyMDg0","user":{"login":"nmpolo","id":1206982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDY5ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1206982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmpolo","html_url":"https://github.com/nmpolo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmpolo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmpolo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmpolo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmpolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmpolo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmpolo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmpolo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmpolo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmpolo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-13T18:45:34Z","updated_at":"2013-05-13T18:45:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley Thanks for your reply.
