This unexpected type also has a dynamically derived explicit(?) mapping which is also unexpected.\n\nThis isn't unexpected at all.  Elasticsearch is doing exactly what you told it to do: \"when you see an index called `myindex`, create it with the following mapping\"\n\n> index.mapper.dynamic is false\n\nThis setting turns off dynamic mappings, so you have to add mappings manually, hence the TypeMissingException.\n\nI think you've misunderstood how dynamic mapping works.  I suggest asking about what you're trying to achieve in the forums: https://discuss.elastic.co\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
