This has been failing on CI but I have not been able to reproduce it locally.  Example CI output from the failure:\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+master+multijob-unix-compatibility/os=oraclelinux/646/console\r\n\r\nThe issue is that `org.apache.lucene.search.TopDocs$MergeSortQueue.<init>(TopDocs.java:128)` throws a NPE, presumably because `shardHits` is null.  The stack trace shows that the calls are initialized from `SearchPhaseController:L265`.  However, the `shardTopDocs` is most certainly initialized and non-null when passed into the `TopDocs.merge` call, so its quite puzzling as to what is happening.","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
