(https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/5fa543867f8cbd0ffde504f495d33cadc8c335ee) \n\nThe downside of the implementation (which me and @mikemccand basically wrote years ago) is that it's a very optimized data-structure and the enhancements that we are shipping in the next major version will resolve this issue. \n\nBelieve me I see a lot of people that try to be loud on issues like this just like you try to. That's fine, I can't change that. What I can change is to let you know that it doesn't help, it is counter productive. You don't like the progress over perfection approach we are practicing! This feature has already as it is provided huge improvements do large scale suggest applications, it's not perfect as documented. \nWe are shipping the improvement that you may need in the next major, back-porting is not an option.\n\nAgain, you may be heard in your environment when you are loud, in this environment you may just be shown wrong and we move on.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/199174045","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7761#issuecomment-199174045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7761","id":199174045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTE3NDA0NQ==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-21T08:35:17Z","updated_at":"2016-03-21T08:35:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drush Just FYI I tried to clarify the documentation and added a possible caveat to the documentation. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
