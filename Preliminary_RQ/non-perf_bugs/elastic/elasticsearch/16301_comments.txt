Checking that LATEST is equal to a specific version just hinders people updating Lucene. I do understand that some updates to Lucene require code changes, but this was a bugfix release and we wanted the fix. You are now depriving us from getting that fix.\n\nI wouldn't mind so much if Elasticsearch were to release a corresponding bugfix update which uses the same updated Lucene, but there was no such update.\n\nIf your goal is to inconvenience people who want to use your library, you might also consider aiming for the maximum score and locking down the version of Java you run against, so that people are forced to run an out of date JRE as well.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
