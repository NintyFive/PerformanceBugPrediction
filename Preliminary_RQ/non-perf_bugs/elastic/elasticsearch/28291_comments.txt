Note these failures are only on the 5.6 and 6.1 branches. This is because the infra changes to support JDK 9 were applied to all CI branches when they should only have been applied to 6.x and master (where we applied the JDK 9 changes). Since there is no actionable item on this repository and this is being tracked internally, I am closing this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
