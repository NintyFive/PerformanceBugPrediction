This makes sense for many use cases, but it would be useful to be able to change this, for example by making the to bound inclusive.\n\nI have the changes ready (+tests :), I would like to commit to 0.90.X and trunk. The changed files are RangeFacetBuilder, RangeFacet, RangeFacetExecutor and RangeFacetParser.\n\nPlease can you let me know if I can go ahead and commit?\n\nThanks,\nShaun\n","closed_by":{"login":"uboness","id":211019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTAxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/211019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness","html_url":"https://github.com/uboness","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
