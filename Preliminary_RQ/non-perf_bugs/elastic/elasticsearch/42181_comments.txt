That issue is strictly speaking distinct.  But they are related in that you often want to use bucket_selector when you are using a moving function.  So if your moving window is 10 days (assuming date_historgram with 1d interval), then you want to skip the first 9 (if the moving_fn is inclusive) or 10 (if not) days of the window.  Referring to the bucket_key would be one way to do this.  Another would simply be to index the buckets.\r\n\r\nLike I say, not related to window alignment, but more generally to the ease and utility of moving_fn - which is a common them for both.
