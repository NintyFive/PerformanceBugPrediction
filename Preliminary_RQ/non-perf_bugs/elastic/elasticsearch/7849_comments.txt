I was thinking more about the informative aspects of it.\nIt is quick and easy to figure out what is happening with the project from there and also follow it through its atom feed which is great for keeping up to speed.\nPerhaps there is even a built in way to integrate it with git commits?\nCheers\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62264210","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7849#issuecomment-62264210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7849","id":62264210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjY0MjEw","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-08T16:40:12Z","updated_at":"2014-11-08T16:40:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @zanona \n\nI played around with adding info to https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/releases and it didn't work out so well.  Putting the full release notes was just too overwhelming - github doesn't truncate each entry on the /releases page.  Also, there was no way of reordering v1.4.0 and v1.3.5 (which is marked as latest).\n\nThanks for the suggestion but, in the end, I decided to leave things as they are.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62264478","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7849#issuecomment-62264478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7849","id":62264478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjY0NDc4","user":{"login":"zanona","id":32017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/32017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanona","html_url":"https://github.com/zanona","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanona/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanona/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanona/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanona/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanona/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanona/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanona/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanona/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanona/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-08T16:47:30Z","updated_at":"2014-11-08T16:47:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks for trying @clintongormley I have to agree they should add a better way to integrate that straight with `git tag -f release-notes.md` for example. hopefully once they adjust this in the future, it will be easier to use. thanks again\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
