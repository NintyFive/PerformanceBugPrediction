The permission sets we now support are great, but there is one use-case that isn't well met: allowing an ops user to _only_ create and manage backups. \n\nIn traditional IT, this is a fairly common role, where one or more individuals in the IT group will manage the backups/snapshot/restore across many different types of systems. In our case, we wouldn't want that user to have complete access to manage the cluster.\n\nThis issue proposes adding a new privilege: `manage_snapshot` (or `manage_backup`?), which would include `create snapshot`, `delete repository`, `delete snapshot`, `get repository` (we need to figure out why it's not under monitoring), `get snapshot`, `put repository`, `restore snapshot`, `snapshot status` (should be monitoring?), and `verify repository`\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"albertzaharovits","id":4568420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njg0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4568420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits","html_url":"https://github.com/albertzaharovits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
