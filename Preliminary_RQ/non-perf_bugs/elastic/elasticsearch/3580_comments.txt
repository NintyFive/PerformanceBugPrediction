(i.e. 5, because 4 zones, 2 nodes in West1, 2 nodes in West2, 1 node in east1, 1 node in east2)\n\nAfter I upgraded to 0.90.5, I thought, ok, and set the number of replicas to 4. \n\nIt removed all shards from one of the nodes, which was not what I expected. And it didn't rebalance after that. \n\nSo I set it back to 5 and then had to wait while the shards got recopied back to that node. \n\nAdditionally, this didn't seem to affect primary allocation, because I have one node that's primary for all of the shards. \n\n![screen shot 2013-10-11 at 11 23 09 am](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/711888/1317103/3a837216-32a2-11e3-8012-c3e43cd28bed.png)\n\nWould that be what you expected to happen?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/26174262","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3580#issuecomment-26174262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3580","id":26174262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTc0MjYy","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-11T21:07:32Z","updated_at":"2013-10-11T21:07:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hmm this seems pretty much balanced no?

Isn't it just kind of just a \"blessing\"?\n\nOk, we experimented some more today. \n![screen shot 2013-10-16 at 3 45 53 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/711888/1347713/c60d3798-36b4-11e3-8ab6-afb4e84d69c8.png)\n\nHere's what I did:\n\nES had run out of memory on the primary. That caused the primary to switch to the 10.100 network, which only has two nodes. (They're basically live backups). I wanted to try to see if the nodes would come back immediately after a restart, plus I want to check the balancing. \n\nI locked allocation based on a thread on the mailing list of someone telling me that they would restart faster if I locked allocation before restarting nodes. \nI killed the two eastern nodes, forcing it to elect a new primary in the west. \nI reduced the number of replicas, which caused it to completely remove a node from elasticsearch. \nI then started up the two eastern nodes, expecting them to come back immediately. They didn't. \nThen I gave up and turned allocation back on, and bumped the number of replicas back up. \nNow I have the above, the primary is in the west, its bootstrapping the node in the west that got kicked out, and its bootstrapping the nodes in the east. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
