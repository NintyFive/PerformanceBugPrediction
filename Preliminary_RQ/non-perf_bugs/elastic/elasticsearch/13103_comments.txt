Examples I can come up with now (though i wish I had a better one) is the commit_timeout (how long to wait for nodes to respond for the intial sending of a cluster state change) which has to be less than publishing timeout (total time for nodes to respond to both the initial send and the commit phase).  I'm sure there are better more concrete ones. \n\nThe new infra does allow you to do this but it's non trivial at all. In the old system it was  easier (because we didn't have many of the rigorous checks and infra we have now) so I think it's an easy win. I'm going to close this for now. We can re-evaluate it when we need this.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
