This is Chrome that is the culprit here though. Here's an explanation:\r\n - the cat APIs are not intended to be used from a browser, instead from the command line and with plain text tools; this is why they serve text/plain content type, and there is no HTML or styling involved\r\n - however, I understand the appeal of using these APIs from the browser, and I agree with you that this is an unfortunate experience for a user\r\n - that said though, this is Chrome behavior on text/plain content type\r\n - you can see examples such as this [one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5837556/how-to-disable-word-wrapping-in-plain-text-files-in-chrome/24213373) where others are trying to figure out how to get Chrome to disable this behavior\r\n - and Firefox has `plain_text.wrap_long_lines` for controlling this behavior \r\n\r\nSo given the above: there is nothing that we are going to do here. I suggest if you find yourself commonly using these APIs from the browser to use Firefox where you have control over this. Might I suggest using Kibana as a front-end to your cluster though?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
