Since we started with 1.0.2, I was curious about the \"_upgrade\" feature.\n\nAfter reading\n\n> Upgrading is an I/O intensive operation, and is **limited to processing a single shard per node at a time**. It also is not allowed to run at the same time as optimize.\n\nand some tests with one and more indices, I did an:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:9200/*/_upgrade\n```\n\nThis killed the node in a matter of minutes because of OutOfMemory exceptions. Nothing serious happened, but I was thinking on how to do this _uprade process with hundreds of indices.\nShould I write some $SHELL script to check the status of the upgrade of every index or did I just miss something?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nRegards,\nMalte\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
