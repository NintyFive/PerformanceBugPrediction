I don't know when it'll get a fix but it certainly is a bug.\n\nI believe `no_match_size` was supposed to return the first n characters of the first entry in the array if. At least that is how I remember it but its been a long while since I wrote it.\n\nYour gist is wonderful! If all issues had such a thing I'd be very happy.\n\nFor next time its: add the `?pretty` option to the requests so they are a little easier to read and/or end them in `;echo`. Without the trailing newline things get messy.\n\nI usually prefer to put the `curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/indexname` as the first line rather than the last. It'll fail the first time unless I have an index with that name in which case it'll clean up the last index.\n\nThanks for filing this.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/142594880","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13734#issuecomment-142594880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13734","id":142594880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjU5NDg4MA==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-23T13:12:28Z","updated_at":"2015-09-23T13:12:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I added 3.0.0 because I confirmed it on my local checkout which happened to be the master branch.
