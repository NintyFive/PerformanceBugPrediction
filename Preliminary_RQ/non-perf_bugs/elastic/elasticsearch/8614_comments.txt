Enforcing the same mapping on fields with the same name under different types is quite breaking the understanding of how the mapping is encapsulated under a type. We are counting on the type separation to allow us to have different mapping for fields with the same name. What you are saying destroys one of the main reasons for having different types under an index. This is going to have serious implications. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
