following:\r\n\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+6.x+multijob-unix-compatibility/os=centos/325\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+master+multijob-darwin-compatibility/1323\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+6.x+multijob-darwin-compatibility/299\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+master+periodic/4838\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+6.x+multijob-windows-compatibility/231\r\n\r\nThis seems related to the (resolved) issue #26332, but this still looks to be an issue.\r\n\r\nThe zero duration comes from TimedRunnable#getTotalNanos() which subtracts two times obtained using `System.nanoTime()` and [its docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime()) say\r\n\r\n> This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily nanosecond resolution (that is, how frequently the value changes) - no guarantees are made except that the resolution is at least as good as that of `currentTimeMillis()`.\r\n\r\nThis means that occasionally getting 0 as the duration of a no-op task isn't totally unexpected, if you're unlucky and your timer resolution isn't very good.","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
