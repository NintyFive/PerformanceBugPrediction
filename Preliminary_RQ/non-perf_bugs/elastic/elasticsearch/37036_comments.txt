A master election is somewhat disruptive to a cluster, and if the highest priority node were consistently partially faulty (e.g. persistent GC or VM pauses, or connectivity issues) then this would trigger repeated master elections each time it joined or left the cluster. This goes against the goal for a cluster to be resilient to a single faulty node.\r\n\r\nA cluster needs to have multiple nodes all of which are capable of taking over as master in order to run smoothly. If you require the elected master to be one specific node then that node is effectively a single point of failure. The solution is to add dedicated master nodes with sufficient resources to do their jobs.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I think this duplicates #14340.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/450618186","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37036#issuecomment-450618186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37036","id":450618186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDYxODE4Ng==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-31T08:05:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-31T08:05:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-distributed","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/450638041","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37036#issuecomment-450638041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37036","id":450638041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDYzODA0MQ==","user":{"login":"vbohata","id":20965804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTY1ODA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/20965804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbohata","html_url":"https://github.com/vbohata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbohata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbohata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbohata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbohata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbohata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbohata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbohata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbohata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vbohata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-31T12:00:47Z","updated_at":"2018-12-31T12:02:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> This goes against the goal for a cluster to be resilient to a single faulty node.\r\n\r\nNot always.
