I think this problem was introduced as a side effect of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/30534. While throwing an error for parsing time values with `\"format\": \"epoch_millis\"` and timezones other than UTC looks like the intented behaviour (see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22621), it should be able to overwrite this by specifying `format` in the aggregation.
