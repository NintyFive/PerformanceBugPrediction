While some `QueryBuilder`s expose their properties, some do not making things pretty difficult.\r\nHere's a couple of examples that I constantly bump into:\r\n\r\n* `SearchSourceBuilder` & `AggregatorFactories$Build`\r\nOne can add aggregations but cannot read them. There's a public method to know their number but the getters are package private.\r\n\r\n* `NestedQueryBuilder`\r\nThe nested field `path` is not accessible so one cannot know what's the nested path. The 'parent' information is availble in `HasParent/HasChildQueryBuilder`s.\r\n\r\nMaybe on a separate topic, it would be great to have some type of visitor api to be able to easily walk a query and collect the needed information.\r\nTake for example inner hits - there seems to be a method for gather them (`InnerHitBuilder#extractInnerHits`) but:\r\na. it only returns copies of the info so it's not possible to update/modify them\r\nb. there's no `InnerHit.EMPTY`-type of object which means most nested/parent/child queries don't have any inner hit specified and as such not much is collected.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
