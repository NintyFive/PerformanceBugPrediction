To know more about scoring in lucene, have a look [here](https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0/core/org/apache/lucene/search/similarities/TFIDFSimilarity.html).  What I briefly described is the inverse document frequency factor in the scoring formula. Have also a look at the explain api to know why the score changes.\n\nI am closing this, I think for next time it would be better to first ask these questions on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/elasticsearch), as we tend to use github issues for actual bugs and feature requests.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/88074253","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10341#issuecomment-88074253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10341","id":88074253,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MDc0MjUz","user":{"login":"esmaeilzadeh","id":4282424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI0MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4282424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/esmaeilzadeh","html_url":"https://github.com/esmaeilzadeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esmaeilzadeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esmaeilzadeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esmaeilzadeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esmaeilzadeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esmaeilzadeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esmaeilzadeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esmaeilzadeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esmaeilzadeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esmaeilzadeh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-31T12:58:36Z","updated_at":"2015-03-31T12:58:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I read this article. there is not anything in that article that explain id of document affect scoring of result.
