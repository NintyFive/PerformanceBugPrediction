using the terms query API, one should use \"terms\" when searching for multiple terms.\n\nThis query works:\n\n``` javascript\n\"query\": {\n  \"terms\": {\n    \"user\": [\n      \"brianclozel\",\n      \"elasticsearch\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis query throws an exception, because an array is given, but an \"s\" is missing in \"term\":\n\n``` javascript\n\"query\": {\n  \"term\": {\n    \"user\": [\n      \"brianclozel\",\n      \"elasticsearch\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen doing the same thing with a facet filter, we get a different behavior.\n\nThis query works as expected:\n\n``` javascript\n\"facets\": {\n  \"followers\": {\n    \"statistical\": {\n      \"field\": \"followers\"\n    },\n    \"facet_filter\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"user\": [\n          \"elasticsearch\",\n          \"brianclozel\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\nWith an \"s\" missing in \"term\", this query does not raise an exception but takes only the first element in the array to apply the filter.\n\n``` javascript\n\"facets\": {\n  \"followers\": {\n    \"statistical\": {\n      \"field\": \"followers\"\n    },\n    \"facet_filter\": {\n      \"term\": {\n
