Doing this type of check explicitly\n- Embedding nodes is not a recommended or supported in any environment.\n- This introduces the potential for unexpected issues \"just\" for the sake of supporting OSGi.\n- Supporting Java 9's jigsaw modularity may require different semantics.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
