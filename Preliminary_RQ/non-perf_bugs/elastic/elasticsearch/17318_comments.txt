These warnings don't affect the functionality of the plugin, though. There is currently no way to remove these warnings except by adding the permissions above. I don't think we should do that as adding security holes just for getting rid of a log message would be a bad thing to do. We should instead make a PR to fix this in the AWS SDK.\n\nAs this is not a bug, I'll close the issue.\n\nOn a related note, I added a test in #17677 that checks the permissions needed by the EC2 discovery plugin more thoroughly.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/208985828","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17318#issuecomment-208985828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17318","id":208985828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODk4NTgyOA==","user":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-12T16:12:24Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T16:12:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This comes up from time to time, despite the fact we silence these warnings out of box.\n\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/distribution/src/main/resources/config/logging.yml#L13-L15\n\nI guess folks remove these lines from the config and then are surprised about the WARN...\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
