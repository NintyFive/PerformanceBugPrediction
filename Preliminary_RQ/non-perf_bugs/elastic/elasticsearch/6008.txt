optimize_bbox is enabled for geo_distance filters, it can cause missing results:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/jtibshirani/1e42809a52be9ac651fc\n\nThis issue occurs on ES 1.1.1, and also in ES 1.0.3 and below, before the upgrade to Lucene 4.7. It seems the distance calculation for the bounding box uses DistanceUnit#getEarthRadius(), which is the radius at the semi-major axis, whereas the actual geo_distance filter uses SloppyMath to do the calculation. In Lucene 4.6 SloppyMath uses the average earth radius, and in 4.7 it averages the radii at the two points.\n\nThe same problem exists for both 'memory' and 'indexed' bounding boxes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
