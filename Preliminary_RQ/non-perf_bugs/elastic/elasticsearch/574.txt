The list of endpoints can be found here: http://aws.amazon.com/articles/3912.\n\nIn order to further simplify the settings and have one region setting that will automatically set ec2 and s3 endpoints, as well as automatically set the region constraint when creating a bucket on s3, the `cloud.aws.region` setting can be set with the following values: `us-east-1`, `us-west-1`, `ap-southeast-1`, `eu-west-1`.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
