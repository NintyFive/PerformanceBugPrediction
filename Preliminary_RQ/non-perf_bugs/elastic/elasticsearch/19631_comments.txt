I am not against this change but it will be annoying for users if we remove these methods only to effectively force them to go back when we deprecate the transport client in favour of the Java http client so at the very least we need to bear this in mind with the java http client. /cc @javanna \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/235836068","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19631#issuecomment-235836068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19631","id":235836068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTgzNjA2OA==","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T08:46:01Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T08:46:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry, ignore the above comment, I hadn't seen that we have just added the `_operation` field to the response of these APIs.

I merged a PR to the docs this morning to explain that they are now deprecated.\n\nI'd also like to rename `_operation` to `operation`. The logic goes: `_` is used for document metadata and `_operation` isn't document metadata.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
