When that lib was upgraded, it specified HTTPCore 4.2.5, which appears not to contain the `org.apache.http.util.Args` class.\n\nSo when we were no longer lucky enough to have another dependency transitively satisfying cloud-aws's dependency on HTTPCore 4.3.x, since cloud-aws doesn't specify HTTPCore 4.3.x in its pomfile, we got a NoClassDefFound error.\n\nIt was something like this before:\n\n```\n                     OUR_APP\n          /                         \\\n         /                           \\\n        /                             \\\n    DepA                     ElasticSearch\n       |                               /  (dep not in pomfile)\n HTTPCore <---------------------------/        \n (no version specified, so grabs 4.3.x)\n```\n\nAnd now we have this:\n\n```\n                     OUR_APP\n          /                         \\\n         /                           \\\n        /                             \\\n    DepA                     ElasticSearch\n       |                               /  (dep not in pomfile)\n HTTPCore <---------------------------/        \n   (4.2.5, breaks ElasticSearch)\n```\n\nShould this dependency be added to the pomfile?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
