Kotlin moved some things out of its embeddable compiler lib into separate tertiary dependencies and they now are not added, so this causes a clear issue.  So it appears I have to go dig up the full tree and manually include each level of dependency.

The gradle plugin is how we (Elastic) build our own plugins, and we want to know *exactly* which dependencies we are using, so we disable transitive dependencies within the entire build. But this has not changed; it has been that way since we switched to gradle in 5.0.\r\n\r\nIf you need help fixing your plugin, please open a [discuss thread](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).
