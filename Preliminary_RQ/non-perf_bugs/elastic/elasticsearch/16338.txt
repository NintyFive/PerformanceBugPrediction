This leads to the case when `fieldValueFactorFunction` is added to the client but index is not rebuilt yet. I use `missing` property. Unfortunately [FieldValueFactorFunctionParser](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/528f6481eaadd2a0585dc6731a94d7a024b8ce29/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/functionscore/fieldvaluefactor/FieldValueFactorFunctionParser.java#L89) demands to have a field in a mapping, it throws exception otherwise. This means we can't deploy an client before index is updated despite having `missing` property set. The suggestion here is to look as `missing` in case of field in the document or mapping are missing.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
