Quoting its javadocs:\n\n```\nFORKED from Lucene 4.5 to be able to:\n1) support discrete highlighting for multiple values, so that we can return a different snippet per value when highlighting the whole text\n2) call the highlightField method directly from subclasses and provide the terms by ourselves\n3) Applied LUCENE-4906 to allow PassageFormatter to return arbitrary objects (LUCENE 4.6)\n\nAll our changes start with //BEGIN EDIT\n```\n\nI don't think we can maintain such forks in the long term as reconciliating changes that come from Lucene upgrades with changes that we did ourselves might even be impossible at some point. So I think it's important that everything that we need gets merged back to Lucene's PostingsHighlighter and that we remove XPostingsHighlighter from Elasticsearch.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
