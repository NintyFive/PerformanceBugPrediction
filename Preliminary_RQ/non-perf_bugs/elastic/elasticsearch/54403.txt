This optimization ensures that we don't need to check time zone transitions on every document.\r\n\r\nWhile this optimization handles most of the cases, the alternative when it is not applicable is very slow since it requires to check for time zone transitions on every document. \r\n\r\nFor time-based indices most of the shards should have a single transition (DST happens twice a year) and few shards should have 2 (before and after DST). \r\nFor the latter, it should be possible to avoid the costly checks by pre-filling the transitions from the possible values in the shard directly in milliseconds since epoch. \r\nThis would allow to resolve such transitions directly with numerics (longs) rather than costly java time object.
