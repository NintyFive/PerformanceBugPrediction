Having types not indexed is not a valid use case, it is necessary for the basic operation of elasticsearch (doing a search like `GET /myindex/type1,type2,type3/_search`).\n\nIf a user doesn't want to pay that cost, they can not use types. By that I mean: send all their documents with the same ES type (the type will still be indexed, but the posting list will be highly compressed because all docs will have the same value).
