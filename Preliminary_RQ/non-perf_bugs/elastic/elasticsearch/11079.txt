2.0, I think we can upgrade the mapping in a way that is not perfect, but will cover most use cases and help users to upgrade without reindexing.\n\n`index_name` and `path` are used for two main purposes:\n- the old way to do `copy_to`\n- provide fieldname aliases, eg `tag` points to `tags`\n\nWe can't distinguish between these two use cases automatically, but we can handle the first use case gracefully, and the second use case is an easy change to make application side (ie just change all use of `tags` to `tag` in searches)\n\nA mapping that looks like this (with `path` set to `just_name`):\n\n```\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"path\": \"just_name\", \n          \"properties\": {\n            \"first\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"index_name\": \"fullname\"\n            },\n            \"last\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"index_name\": \"fullname\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\ncould be rewritten to:\n\n```\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"fullname\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"first\": {\n              \"index\": \"no\",\n              \"copy_to\": \"fullname\"\n            },\n            \"last\": {\n              \"index\": \"no\",\n              \"copy_to\": \"fullname\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe mapping for the new `fullname` field can just be the same as the mapping of the first field which uses `index_name` (without the `index_name`) setting.  The original field will not be indexed (or searchable).\n\nIn the case where `path`  is set to `full`, the same rules apply, but the new field uses the full path name, ie this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"path\": \"full\", \n          \"properties\": {\n            \"first\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"index_name\": \"fullname\"\n            },\n            \"last\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"index_name\": \"fullname\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\ncould be rewritten as:   \n\n```\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"first\": {\n              \"index\": \"no\",\n              \"copy_to\": \"name.fullname\"\n            },\n            \"last\": {\n              \"index\": \"no\",\n              \"copy_to\": \"name.fullname\"\n            },\n            \"fullname\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
