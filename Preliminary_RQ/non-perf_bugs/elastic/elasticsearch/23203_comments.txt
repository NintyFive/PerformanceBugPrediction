The test seems strange - it assumes either >1 shards fail without throwing an exception or that exactly one of them should fail and throw an exception. \r\nI can see in a reproducable case (seed 6B40AF951FC8500E) that 2 shards report failure messages and an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nPresumably the general error-handling contract for search is if >1 primary shard succeeds then there is no exception and we report the partial failures. Only if _all_ shards fail do we then throw an exception. Is this true @s1monw ? If so the test does not test this contract properly.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
