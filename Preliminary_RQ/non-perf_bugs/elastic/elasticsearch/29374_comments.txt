I tried to reproduce this with 6.3.2 as described in the discuss issue, but also couldn't. The `parsing_exception` you see is completely explainable from the code when you run a 6.3 client against a cluster with some nodes running with versions before 6.1 since https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/26097 was only introduced in 6.1. Thats not a bug however, since the client it supposed to be [forward compatibly](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/master/java-rest-high-compatibility.html) only.\r\nI would like you to check again the versions of all your cluster nodes (e.g. using [the nodes info API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-info.html) together with making sure they are all the same and higher or the same as the client version you are using in your reproduction. If the issue still persists we probably need more info about how you set up the client project, initialize the connection etc... but first please double check the versions again since I cannot reproduce this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/426291984","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29374#issuecomment-426291984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29374","id":426291984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjI5MTk4NA==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T14:20:22Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T14:20:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing with no further feedback.
