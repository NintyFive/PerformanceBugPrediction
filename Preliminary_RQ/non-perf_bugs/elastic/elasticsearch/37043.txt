Given that fields are most of time both indexed and doc-valued, maybe we could optimize sorting in an even greater number of cases.\r\n\r\nFor instance imagine that a user searches for top documents matching query `Q` sorted by field `@timestamp` of type `date` in descending order. Maybe we could internally rewrite the query under the hood to `SHOULD(LongDistanceFeatureQuery(field=@timestamp, origin=Long.MAX_VALUE)) FILTER(Q)` and prepend `_score` to the sort: `[ \"_score\", { \"@timestamp\": { \"order\": \"desc\" } } ]`.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of details to sort out, like we could only do that it the field is indexed and we would need to rewrite the produced TopFieldDocs so that they don't include a sort value for the score and maybe take the maximum value of the field rather than Long.MAX_VALUE to avoid defeating the optimization because most scores would be equal after casting to a float, but overall it looks to me like it could help optimize almost all sorted queries without requiring index-time decisions?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
