Automation tooling expects the package to be installed first, and then configured after, Elasticsearch expects itself to be configured first, then installed after.\r\n\r\nAs a result, automated installations via cloud-init break.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Tell cloud-init to install the \"elasticsearch\" package.\r\n 2. Instantiate the machine.\r\n 3. Cloud-init fails with the following fatal error, and all box configuration is halted:\r\n\r\nSelecting previously unselected package elasticsearch.\r\nPreparing to unpack .../080-elasticsearch_6.8.5_all.deb ...\r\ncould not find java; set JAVA_HOME\r\ndpkg: error processing archive /tmp/apt-dpkg-install-R5VwK1/080-elasticsearch_6.8.5_all.deb (--unpack):\r\n new elasticsearch package pre-installation script subprocess returned error exit status 1\r\n\r\nTo fix this, the debian package install scripts must not fail with a fatal error if the system is not yet sane. The system will become sane later when configuration is completed.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
