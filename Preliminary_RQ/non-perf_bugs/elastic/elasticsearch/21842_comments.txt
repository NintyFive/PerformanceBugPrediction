This does seem to be an oversight on our part for sure. The ScriptProcessor leverages the ScriptService's caching strategies to keep around a compiled version of each script passed in. The reason we chose not to compile the script up-front is due to any changes that may occur with respect to stored scripts, or file-based scripts. Didn't want the pipeline to have to listen to such changes.\r\n\r\nSince inline scripts are not subject to such management, should be straightforward to treat inline scripts separately and compile it ourselves.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
