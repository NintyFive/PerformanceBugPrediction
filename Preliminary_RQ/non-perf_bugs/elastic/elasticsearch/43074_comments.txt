For the snapshot status API we return a serialized `org.elasticsearch.action.admin.cluster.snapshots.status.SnapshotStatus` which calculates the timings from the individual shard stats.\r\nOn the other hand, for the snapshot info API we return a `SnapshotInfo` which has the concrete start time stored in it. I think we should simply make the snapshot status API load the `SnapshotInfo` from the repo as well and use that instead of a calculation form the shard stats for determining the timings.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
