This doesn't take much time at all until all nodes are added.\n\nBut it takes more minutes then until the cluster state jumps from 0 unassigned shards to let's say 5000 shards. After the first update, it get's faster. The more accurate the unassigned shards number is, the faster it seems to update. It's a little scary the first time, as one might expect that all data is lost ;-). \nIf we add the nonssd servers, it even takes much longer (up to 10-15 minutes until the counter goes up). (might be related to slower storage, or more indexed shards, or even more nodes). We will try to test this with the new version to identify the exact cause.\nDuring that phase we observed no traffic spikes (I guess because the state is just smaller, as no shards are allocated so far).\n\nThe traffic spikes occur if nodes are being rebalanced, we update the mapping, or do some other operation which requires the state to be sent.\n\nWe actually found out the bandwith issue as we had custom rebalancing code which shuffled indexes between 2 nodes back and forth and we wondered why everything felt so slow.
