ConstructingObjectParser collects parsing result in an array of objects which has to be processed into an object, which causes us to write a lot of code that looks like this:\r\n```\r\n                int i = 0;\r\n                boolean completed = (boolean) a[i++];\r\n                TaskInfo task = (TaskInfo) a[i++];\r\n                BytesReference error = (BytesReference) a[i++];\r\n                BytesReference response = (BytesReference) a[i++];\r\n                return new TaskResult(completed, task, error, response);\r\n```\r\nI had a long and boring flight during which I thought about different ways to improve the ConstructingObjectParser experience and came up with a couple of prototypes: \r\n- The first approach simply wraps an iterator and casting into a helper object imotov/elasticsearch@bdce5cb\r\n- The second approach replaces an array with a map imotov/elasticsearch@cbe683d\r\n\r\nI would like to solicit feedback on the these two solutions and maybe other ideas about how to improve this areas.\r\n\r\nCC @nik9000
