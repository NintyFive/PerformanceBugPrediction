We don't want to document this anymore even though this is still supported internally. Running a query with a single level is already costly so more than one level should be avoided.

For our users, having multiple levels of parent-child capability is really a critical functionality need. Yes, we all acknowledge that there are performance implications of this, but performance considerations are a cost-benefit decision. It's very important that we allow users to have this flexibility. Even with multiple tiers of parent-child functionality, Elasticsearch is still far faster than most other products at performing these operations. I'd ask you to please reconsider documenting this - we have active users using a data model requiring multiple levels of parent-child relationships.
