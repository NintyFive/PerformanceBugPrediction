Is this feature targeting 7.6?\r\n\r\nKibana allows users to create filters from shapes in the UI. Those filters are placed in the URL. Having to put the shape geometry into the URL can cause the URLs to be too long and prevents users from creating filters from shapes with too many vertices when querying against geo_point fields. This is a large limitation. It is also a complex error to explain to users. Allowing pre-indexed shape query for geo_point fields would greatly simplify our messaging and allow filtering to work for any shape already indexed in ES and provide good messaging to users when shape is not indexed in ES. \r\n\r\ncc @elastic/kibana-gis
