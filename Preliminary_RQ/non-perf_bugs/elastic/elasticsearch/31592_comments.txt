I have seen how much confusion it makes to the newcomers that there are different types `keyword` and `text` and how they can be searched/aggregated. (A quick search on StackOverflow shows a bunch of related questions: https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=elasticsearch+terms+fielddata)\r\n\r\nThe `terms` aggregation documentation page seems a perfect place to resolve this confusion, and I also like the idea of adding the mapping and the sample data.\r\n\r\nBut I am having a couple of doubts that I would like to resolve before committing an enhancement.\r\n\r\n### Why do I think it is a good idea\r\n\r\nPutting a mapping in the example will, first, make it clear which kind of data structure we are working with, and second, will give to a newcomer an idea that mappings exist and they are important (very often in the StackOverflow questions they do not post mappings making it extremely difficult to answer as-is). Just a bare curiosity of \"what is this mapping thing?\" would be enough to move a newcomer towards getting to know what the mapping is.\r\n\r\nAdding sample data completes the example with possibility to copy-paste the data and try it on your own, which is also important for learning.\r\n\r\n### Why do I think it is not\r\n\r\nThe first doubt:\r\nIt does not look like mappings are generally put in the examples in the Elasticsearch documentation. Wouldn't adding a mapping in the example here break the general picture?\r\n\r\nThe second doubt:\r\nMappings and example documents will inevitably blow up the page visually, and the conciseness of the current version will be lost.\r\n\r\n### What do I propose\r\n\r\nHaving in mind these doubts I think it is better to put a \"Note\" section after `GET /_search` part or a footnote just inside the query example, saying something like this:\r\n\r\n> `terms` aggregation needs a field of type `keyword` or any other data type suitable for bucket aggregations. In order to use it with `text` you will need to enable `fielddata`.\r\n\r\nThis way we keep the conciseness of the example, we provide a complete explanation (the example would only cover `keyword` type, hiding the possibility to use `text` with `fielddata`, or vice versa), and do not break the visual impression.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me what you think about this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/462016312","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31592#issuecomment-462016312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31592","id":462016312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjAxNjMxMg==","user":{"login":"srensamblador","id":33845232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQ1MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/33845232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srensamblador","html_url":"https://github.com/srensamblador","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srensamblador/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srensamblador/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srensamblador/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srensamblador/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srensamblador/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srensamblador/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srensamblador/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srensamblador/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srensamblador/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-09T05:46:35Z","updated_at":"2019-02-09T05:46:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think a footnote in the query would be nice.
