So I think it will be good if we can track search request, so that we can handle easily. \n\nI've stated below what I am trying to tell. \n\nFor multi search request we have to do: \n\n```\n{\"query\" : {\"match_all\" : {}}, \"from\" : 0, \"size\" : 10}\n{\"query\" : {\"match_all\" : {}}}\n```\n\nI think It will be better if we can do \n\n```\n{\"query\" : {\"match_all\" : {}}, \"from\" : 0, \"size\" : 10,\"tag\":\"topten\"}\n{\"query\" : {\"match_all\" : {}},\"tag\":\"all\"}\n```\n\nSo the response will look like\n\n```\n{\n    \"responses\": [\n        {\n            \"tag\": \"topten\",.. all other objects\n        },\n        {\n            \"tag\": \"all\",... all other objects\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
