You are right indeed. The first two are leftovers from #18377, the third item is a leftover from #17650.\r\n\r\nFor the first two items, the replacements that you mention are correct. \r\n\r\nFor the third item, the replacements are `*IndexedScript*` -> `*StoredScript*` (e.g. `PutIndexedScriptResponse` -> `PutStoredScriptResponse`, `client.preparePutIndexedScript()` -> `client.preparePutStoredScript()`).\r\n\r\nGiven that these two cover unrelated (functional) areas in the docs, I think it makes sense to create two more focussed tickets and close this one.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/356204907","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28114#issuecomment-356204907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28114","id":356204907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjIwNDkwNw==","user":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-09T07:44:28Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T07:44:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've raised #28143 and #28144 as more concrete follow-up tickets and hence close this one now.
