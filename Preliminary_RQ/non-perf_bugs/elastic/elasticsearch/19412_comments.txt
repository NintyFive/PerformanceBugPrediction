I think that would be the best separation here. Another idea is to move the transport client into it's own project entirely that depends on core and netty but is pulled in from `test/framework` to cycle it in tests as we do today. I think we have to keep that feature (testing it with core) otherwise there are too many sources of bugs and I am hesitating in investing too much into it. @rjernst WDYT\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/232602870","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19412#issuecomment-232602870","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19412","id":232602870,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjYwMjg3MA==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T08:39:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T08:39:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Creating `client/transport-client` sounds right to me.
