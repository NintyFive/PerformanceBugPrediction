we have multiple ways to define settings when a user needs to create a repository:\r\n\r\n* in `elasticsearch.yml` file using `repositories.xxx` prefix where `xxx` is the implementation name like `s3`, `hdfs`...\r\n* when creating the repository itself with `PUT _snaphot/repo`\r\n\r\nBased on discussion we have on #22762 and on #22301 and also internally, I think we should reduce the overall complexity and completely remove support for global settings like this.\r\n\r\nActually, the creation of a repository is most of the time a unique manual operation so providing settings at repository creation time does not bring a lot of complexity for the end user.\r\n\r\nAnd that will simplify **a lot** our code and our tests.\r\n\r\nThe plan would be:\r\n\r\n* Deprecate `repositories.xxx` settings in 5.x:\r\n\r\n- [x] Azure plugin (#22856)\r\n- [x] S3 plugin (#23278)\r\n\r\n* Remove `repositories.xxx` settings in 6.x (master branch):\r\n\r\n- [x] Azure plugin (#23262)\r\n- [ ] S3 plugin (#23276 has been closed. It will be done within another PR)\r\n\r\n* Check other plugins:\r\n\r\n- [X] GCS plugin (not needed as already not supported)\r\n- [X] HDFS plugin (not needed as already not supported)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
