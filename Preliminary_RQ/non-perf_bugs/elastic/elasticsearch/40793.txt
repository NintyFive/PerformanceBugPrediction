Currently, we check for these errors manually. However, there is a feature that allows searches with partial results to fail with an exception instead of responding. We should revisit and simplify data extractors by setting `allow_partial_search_results` to `false` in the relevant search requests. Note, an additional benefit doing this is that when the search fails any scroll context gets cleared automatically, reducing the chance of data extractors leaking scroll contexts (see #40772).","closed_by":{"login":"benwtrent","id":4357155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTcxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4357155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent","html_url":"https://github.com/benwtrent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
