This is relevant for concurrent changes to the same document (which doesn't happen for the append only case) but also when we recover a shard (replayed operation from the primary translog are concurrent to index requests). \n2) Now that we are going to have #20211 , we are actually not using the version for lookups but we still store it (more on removing it in the following points).\n3) Long term, the plan is to move to use seq# instead of versioning both for out of order delivery and optimistic locking. At that point my idea is to turn off the per document versioning and allow people to enable it if they want it (external versioning is the main use case here).\n4) Our plan is allow people to use an index level setting to indicate that an index is append only. We also said we want people to be able to change it on a close index (this will be nice where people want a fast re-index where they know they are only indexing things once, but then enable the index for full operations). If we allow this change, we can't remove the version field completely and I think it should be populated with 1 (the first version value).  \n\nGiven (3) is the long term plan and with #20211 , I'm not sure it's worth while going through the cycles of disabling version now. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/373580481","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19913#issuecomment-373580481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19913","id":373580481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MzU4MDQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-16T02:04:05Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T02:04:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing this as we now have implemented seq# and append-only.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
