But Debian wheezy/stable is still using subversion 1.6 and is what we use.\nI found https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/1.3/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/logging/log4j/LogConfigurator.java#L107 which is the problematic part.\nimo it should at least skip \"hidden\" directories, if not be limited to some more strict rules (file extension whitelist without the \"catch-all\" default, ...).\n\nI thought of only ignoring the failed file, but that could lead to strange errors too. \nWhat if you have a logging.json. Then you would have a .svn/text-base/logging.json.text-base, which could import and override the original logging.json (local modified logging.json). => quite troublesome to find out why the changes don't work until you commit them :)\n##### Known workarounds (also see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elasticsearch/8zlwEj12DjI):\n1. Add \"copy/move to logging.yml\" command before startup (so that the file in .svn doesn't start with \"logging.\")\n2. mount an empty directory over .svn (tmpfs, ...). Umount/mount if needed to work with svn <= that's the solution we use, since we mount it readonly over nfs and cp/mv doesn't work\n\nI think both workarounds are quite dirty hacks and you shouldn't be forced to use those, just because you use a vcs.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
