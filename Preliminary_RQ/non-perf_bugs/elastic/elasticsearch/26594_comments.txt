The issue #23640 gives more context. \r\n\r\nWe don't really _simplified the JAR_, but instead we made sure that the JNA library used by Elasticsearch is linked to the right glibc version on all the platforms we support and test as part of our CI infrastructure. \r\n\r\nAs you can see on https://www.elastic.co/fr/support/matrix#matrix_jvm IBM JVM are not supported (nor tested on our CI). I don't think that we have plan to support it in the future, so I'm closing this for now.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
