From the docs (including the examples), we are led to believe that it can only be used on fields of type `object`. See quote below.\r\n\r\n> The enabled setting, which can be applied only to the mapping type and to object fields, causes Elasticsearch to skip parsing of the contents of the field entirely. The JSON can still be retrieved from the _source field, but it is not searchable or stored in any other way:\r\n\r\nI tested.
