This leads to the `host` and `ip` fields always being equal here. As such, the `host` field here should probably just be removed from the cat nodes API; if you need a name one appears as the `name` field in the cat nodes API (already shown in your output); this is something that you can completely control via node configuration.\n\nAs for the sorting, the design of cat API is meant to be friendly with standard command line tools. In this case, if you need to sort on `name` you can just do:\n\n```\n$ curl -XGET locahost:9200/_cat/nodes | sort -k8\n```\n\n(until the default output changes to have the `host` field removed).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/183900323","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16575#issuecomment-183900323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16575","id":183900323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MzkwMDMyMw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-14T14:30:02Z","updated_at":"2016-02-14T14:30:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closed by #16656\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
