It is much easier for a user to discover and solve the problem of \"there are too many warning headers coming back and it's blowing up my proxy\" versus the lack of ability to easily discover \"there are too many warnings headers and they are silently being truncated\". I have explained this previously [here](\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/28427#discussion_r168654819).\r\n\r\nAnd no matter what we agree on, we would never change this in a minor let alone a patch release.

Our intention from the beginning in #28301 is that this be unbounded by default in our distributions though.
