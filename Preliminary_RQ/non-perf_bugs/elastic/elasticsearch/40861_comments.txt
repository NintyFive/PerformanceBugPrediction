Here's a summary:\r\n\r\n- We currently risk proliferating too many \"Getting Started\" and \"Quick Start\" guides across the Elastic Stack. This is particularly true for installation instructions.\r\n- There are ongoing efforts to consolidate this type of content in the [Getting Started with Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/master/get-started-elastic-stack.html) guide.\r\n- @kat257 and others will lead efforts to inventory our current \"start\" documentation.\r\n- To not add further proliferation, we'll close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
