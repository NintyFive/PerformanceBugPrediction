With this decision, I am forced to write my own deterministic data serialization function in Painless. \r\n\r\nCan you give more reasoning about this decision? My idea is that the underlying JSON library you are using supports this already and you only need to pass a parameter like \"pretty=true\" or something. Without this, it would require some custom JSON implementation for serialization. Currently my workaround is to delete all nested hashes for testing, this is enough for me currently but I fear the situation where I also need to test deep hash datasets.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
