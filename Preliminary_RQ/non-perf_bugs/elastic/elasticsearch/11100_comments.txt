These aliases are consuming a big chunk of memory on every node in your cluster, and making cluster state updates very heavy.  Even with cluster state diffs, it's still going to be slow.  I'd really consider adopting another plan which doesn't involve that many aliases (eg just adding the filter and routing values dynamically on to each request via your application)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/102535734","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11100#issuecomment-102535734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11100","id":102535734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjUzNTczNA==","user":{"login":"msimos","id":11743255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzQzMjU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11743255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msimos","html_url":"https://github.com/msimos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msimos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msimos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msimos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msimos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msimos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msimos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msimos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msimos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msimos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-15T22:08:45Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T22:08:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @clintongormley,\n\nThis is what we recommended.
