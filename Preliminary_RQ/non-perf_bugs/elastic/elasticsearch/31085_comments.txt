This appears to be a question about usage for the elasticsearch python client. These types of questions are better suited to our forums (https://discuss.elastic.co/), as we try to reserve GitHub issues for discussions around development, like bug reports and feature requests.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this issue, but if you find a bug or missing feature after asking your question in the discussion forums, feel free to re-open it or file a new one.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
