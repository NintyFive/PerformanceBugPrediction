This makes sense, and quite useful in many scenarios - for example in ours, where we check to see if it == 1 and if it does we know its a new entry and can do perform some extra actions.\n\nWhen specifying a version yourself by using the external version type, you already know what version to expect in the response if the indexing operation succeeds. Hence, the version returned is quite meaningless. In this scenario, I would really like to get the PREVIOUS version. For us this would mean knowing whether this is a new entry or not.\n\nI'll be happy to provide a pull request with this change if this helps :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
