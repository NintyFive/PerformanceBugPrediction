It looks like I made some assumptions about the shape of the \"current transition list\" vs the \"future transition rules\" that was incorrect. It caused duplicate transitions in my list which oddly, never broke with time *unit* rounding, but does break with time *interval* rounding. They do use different strategies, especially around overlaps. Anyway, the tzdb for `America/Tijuana` has a similar behavior for me locally so I can reproduce this issue.
