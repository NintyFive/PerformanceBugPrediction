The mapping for a dynamic field is set on the first document that contains the field and the type is inferred based on what this field looks like. So your problem is that the first document with this field contained a number. As you noticed one way to deal with this situation is to force the mapping for the field. \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/270924035","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22470#issuecomment-270924035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22470","id":270924035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDkyNDAzNQ==","user":{"login":"rcastill","id":8534987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MzQ5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8534987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcastill","html_url":"https://github.com/rcastill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcastill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcastill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcastill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcastill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcastill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcastill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcastill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcastill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcastill/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T15:14:20Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T15:38:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"~~@jimczi I think it may a bug, I have just queried my MongoDB database and there is no document that has a number under that field.~~\r\n\r\nHehe, there were unexpected documents to have numbers.
