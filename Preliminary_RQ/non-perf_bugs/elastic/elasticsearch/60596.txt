This means that if a node is shut down with a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` while a data frame analytics job is running on it then that job could spuriously be marked as `failed` due to an exception that was purely due to the node being shut down.  (It's only the graceful shutdown signals that carry this risk.  `SIGKILL` instantly kills the whole JVM, so there's no chance of a job being marked as `failed` when its node receives a `SIGKILL`.)\r\n\r\nEarly on in the shutdown sequence flags need to be set on the data frame analytics jobs that will ignore certain exceptions and stop them failing so that they can pick up where they left off on a different node.\r\n\r\nSomething needs adding here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/84a7b1cc6b4903b42c5d2a24be499bdf1385fe62/x-pack/plugin/ml/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/ml/MlLifeCycleService.java#L41-L47\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"przemekwitek","id":19312454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzEyNDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19312454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek","html_url":"https://github.com/przemekwitek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
