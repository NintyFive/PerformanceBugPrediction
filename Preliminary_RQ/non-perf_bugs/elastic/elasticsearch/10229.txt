Each node has an attribute with its zone name, and shard allocation awareness is enabled based on that zone name. Every shard has a copy in both zones.\n\nNow I want to minimize search traffic across zones to reduce latency. I'd like to set a search preference that prefers shards in the same zone as the coordinator, since communicating with those shards will be faster.\n\nThis would probably look something like `preference=_prefer_availability_zone:_local`. In this case, specifying a zone isn't helpful, because I want the value to be the coordinator's value.\n\nThis is a more general approach to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5925.\n","closed_by":{"login":"grantr","id":680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr","html_url":"https://github.com/grantr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
