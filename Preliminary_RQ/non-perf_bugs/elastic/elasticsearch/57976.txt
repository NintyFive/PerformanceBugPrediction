For example:\r\n\r\n> This makes the deletion logic quite complicated - annotations should be deleted when all jobs they relate to are deleted, but the wide variety of ways of specifying which jobs an annotation relates to makes determination of this complex.\r\n\r\nand:\r\n\r\n> We also decided that it would be useful to have persistent annotations, that _don't_ get deleted if all the jobs they relate to get deleted. This would be useful for the case of repeatedly deleting and recreating a job to try out slightly different configurations.\r\n>\r\n> So there should be an `is_persistent` boolean field in the annotations too.\r\n\r\nThe way annotations was eventually developed means the first thought is completely irrelevant.  We envisaged annotations that would apply to multiple jobs but currently every annotation is bound to exactly one job.\r\n\r\nThe second idea is still potentially relevant, but we never implemented the `is_persistent` boolean field.\r\n\r\nGiven that large numbers of annotations will now be generated by model change events, it makes sense that we delete all annotations related to a job with a `create_username` of `_xpack` when the job is deleted.\r\n\r\nThis should be done as an extra step in the chain of deletion steps in `TransportDeleteJobAction.deleteJobDocuments()`.","closed_by":{"login":"przemekwitek","id":19312454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzEyNDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19312454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek","html_url":"https://github.com/przemekwitek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
