During this time, the cluster had a basic license applied. I decided I wanted to start using Graph, so I added a platinum license, but noticed some strange behavior.\r\n\r\nThe graph icon never showed up in Kibana on the left hand side, but I did see a link to Graph in the Kibana Getting Started page like shown in this screenshot:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42154607/86408281-ec4dbd00-bc73-11ea-989f-73af096e8865.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the graph link, the following error message shows up in the lower right hand corner:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42154607/86408291-f2dc3480-bc73-11ea-847c-f2a2b211ed23.png)\r\n\r\nI discovered that the issue was that the `xpack.graph.enabled` parameter was set to false in the `Elasticsearch.yml` file. However, the only documentation I could find on this parameter was in the [Kibana documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/graph-settings-kb.html#) stating that it should be added in the` Kibana.yml` file, and even in the older [6.8 documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/settings-xpack.html) it states that graph settings are added to the` Kibana.yml` file.\r\n\r\nI am assuming that since the parameter was able to be set in the `Elasticsearch.yml` file that it is a valid parameter to use, and I wanted to see if the Elasticsearch documentation could be updated to mention this parameter and include an explanation of when you would want to use it in the Elasticsearch config vs. in the Kibana config. I am assuming it should be used when you want to lock down Graph at the cluster level instead of at the Kibana level, but I wasn't 100% sure if that is correct. Thank you for looking into this possible doc enhancement further!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
