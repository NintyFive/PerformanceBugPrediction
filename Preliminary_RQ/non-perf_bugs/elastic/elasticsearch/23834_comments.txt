This feature request makes the assumption that we are able to qualify how good a match is, which is not the case. This page gives some background about the issue https://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ScoresAsPercentages.\r\n\r\nOne way to work-around the issue could be to use `constant_score` queries, or the upcoming [`boolean` similarity](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/23637), which generate predictable scores.\r\n\r\nBut I agree with you we need to work on making it easier to combine full-text relevance with other sources of relevance. This is something that has been researched (in particular with geo) and we need to make progress on exposing better ways to combine full-text scores with other kinds of scores.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/290699898","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23834#issuecomment-290699898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23834","id":290699898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDY5OTg5OA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-31T12:33:51Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T12:33:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We just discussed it in FixitFriday and decided to close it in favour of a new issue: #23850.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
