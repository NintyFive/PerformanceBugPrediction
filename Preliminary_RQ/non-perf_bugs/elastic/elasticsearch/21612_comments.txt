As you already noticed, this does not necessarily mean that physical memory usage should increase. Moreover, the access patterns to the index did not change so I would not expect a performance degradation. There is more information about this change at https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/17616.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/261198491","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21612#issuecomment-261198491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21612","id":261198491,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTE5ODQ5MQ==","user":{"login":"xgwu","id":10510416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEwNDE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10510416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgwu","html_url":"https://github.com/xgwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgwu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-17T09:33:51Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T09:33:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jpountz Thanks for explanation!
