The index thread pool is of type fixed, but has a `queue_size` configured (`200` as mentioned in the listing of thread pools), so it is not unbounded.\n\nYou can potentially set it to unbounded, but this may just postpone a performance problem with your cluster, as you then simply put all the pending requests into a memory queue instead of rejecting them, posing the thread og going out of memory.\n\nPlease explain your problem more detailed on the mailinglist, as github issues should only be used for bugs and issues. Thanks a lot!\n\nIf you think the paragraph wording could be improved, please create a PR by all means!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
