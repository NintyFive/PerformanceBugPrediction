(it was suggested that i should comment here with this)\n\nThe percolate API takes queries against an index and when a new document is added, it flags which queries in an index match against it (e.g. a simple boolean yes/no).\n\nWould it be possible to extend percolate so that it could be used as a form of index classification e.g. I have x percolate queries registered in index A and y percolate queries in index B, tell me which index i match the new content on based on percolation.\n\nI'm guessing this is a logical extension of some form of exposing the term frequency (or other) already in each index to classify a new document. The idea would be that you could work out what terms are 'good training classification data' for an index and then use that to figure out where a document should go?\n\nDerry\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
