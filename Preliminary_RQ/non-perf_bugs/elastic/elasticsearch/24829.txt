version**: 5.4.0\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: []\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`): Java 8 u131\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system): Windows 2012R2 (also tested on Windows 10)\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.4/windows.html#windows-service-settings) is saying:\r\n> The Elasticsearch service can be configured prior to installation by setting the following environment variables (either using the set command from the command line, or through the System Properties->Environment Variables GUI).\r\n\r\nBut when the variables are set using the `set` command, they are not picked up by the service installer and use the defaults instead. When set via the GUI, it works as expected. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Unzip elasticsearch-5.4.0.zip to C:\\TEMP\\ESServiceTestA\r\n2. Open a command window with admin privileges and enter the following commands:\r\na. _cd C:\\TEMP\\ESServiceTestA\\elasticsearch-5.4.0\\bin_\r\nb. set DATA_DIR=C:\\TEMP\\ESServiceTestA\\data\r\nc. set LOG_DIR=C:\\TEMP\\ESServiceTestA\\logs\r\nd. elasticsearch-service install ESServiceTestA\r\ne. sc start ESServiceTestA\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n1. After executing the new service the following folders are created and being used. \r\n`C:\\TEMP\\ESServiceTestA\\elasticsearch-5.4.0\\data` and `C:\\TEMP\\ESServiceTestA\\elasticsearch-5.4.0\\logs` instead of the ones specified in `DATA_DIR` and `LOG_DIR`. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
