Looking at the code [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v5.6.3/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/GeoPolygonQueryBuilder.java#L191) the check does exist but is using the lat value instead of the lon value. \r\n\r\nThis also appears to exist in the current master version (link to code [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/GeoPolygonQueryBuilder.java#L180))\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce by running a `geo_polygon` query using lat/long points in elasticsearch `5.6.3`. Note that you will need a `geo_point` field to query against. Using a lat of `< -90` or `> 90` will return an error about an `illegal latitude value`, but using a lon of `< -180` or `> 180` will not return an error.\r\n\r\nBased on the code link above, I would also assume you could do the same on any version `> 5.6.3`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
