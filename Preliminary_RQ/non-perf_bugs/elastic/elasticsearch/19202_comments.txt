In this case, a [408 status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.7) would and does mean that the server timed out waiting for the client. However, [500-level status codes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6) are for _server_ issues. The `ElasticsearchTimeoutException` is used internally when an internal operation times out so I think a 500-level status code is correct. As there is not a specific 500-level status code for this situation, the generic [500 status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6.1) seems apt.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
