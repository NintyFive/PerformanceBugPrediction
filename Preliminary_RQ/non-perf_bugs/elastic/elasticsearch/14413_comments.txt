still need the interface to provide their parsing code for the ext section. We may want to revise a bit this code though and make it clear that it's needed only for plugins.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/245202383","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14413#issuecomment-245202383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14413","id":245202383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTIwMjM4Mw==","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-07T07:47:31Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T07:47:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yep, the `SearchParseElement` is now only used for plugins which add a custom fetch sub phase.
