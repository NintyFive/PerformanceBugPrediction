These profiles allow for binding to multiple addresses and/or ports. \n\nAfter #10350 there is a new `TransportChannel` implementation, `DirectResponseChannel`, used in the netty transport, which does not have the profile information. This implementation should provide a profile name to make it easier to deal with logic based on profiles in the netty transport. The name could be something like `__local__`.\n\nAdding the `getProfileName` method to the `TransportChannel` interface may make sense here as other transport implementations may implement the profile concept and those that don't can just return a default name.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
