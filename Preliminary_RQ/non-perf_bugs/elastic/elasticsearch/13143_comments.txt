I get that. I just find that whenever I have a pull request that's been sitting around for more than a few days it merges cleanly _except_ for migration_2_0 or migration_2_1. I remember you're work to move the change into multiple docs and it helped. But I'm seeing it again with 2.1. I'll poke this with a concrete example if it happens again.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/135751131","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13143#issuecomment-135751131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13143","id":135751131,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTc1MTEzMQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-28T12:02:37Z","updated_at":"2015-08-28T12:02:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not always possible but perhaps adding the breaking change into a particular section, instead of just appending, will make conflicts less likely\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
