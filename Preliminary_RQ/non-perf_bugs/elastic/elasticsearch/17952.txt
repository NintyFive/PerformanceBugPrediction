As shown in the attached image, I tried setting indices.breaker.request.limit=8Mb whilst debugging a load issue that might have been linked to the size of the documents. I expected to see the trip count increase as the request estimated size passed the 8Mb threshold but that didn't occur. We didn't see an increased rate of rejection so Marvel it most likely reporting truthful data. \nindices.breaker.request.overhead was left set to 1.\n\nIt might be a misunderstanding of the documentation but in that case I'd recommend reviewing the page\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/circuit-breaker.html\n\n![screen shot 2016-04-25 at 12 51 12](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/506458/14783160/b5e27254-0ae5-11e6-96c5-c453f3189766.png)\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
