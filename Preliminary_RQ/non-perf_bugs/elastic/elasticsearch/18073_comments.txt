What are the pros / cons?\n\n@t3chn0m4g3 sure - lemme iterate some of the points:\n- the yaml file is for node level configurations. The settings can be different from node to node ie. if a node has more CPU than another you might want different settings on the threadpool or you have repository configured or you have some nodes with more than one disk etc.\n- all settings that start with `index.` are index level setting and must be configured in a way that whatever node is the master when the index is created the result is the same. We can't guarantee this with node level settings. (yet there is one exception `index.codec` since this is really a node level setting in the way it's used)\n- our construct to set defaults for an index are index templates that can hold default configurations, supporting this on the yaml file is yet another source of defaults which causes a bigger level of complexity since all these settings must be consequently merged together. \n- not allowing these settings in a yaml file reduces the chance of inconsistent configuration - this is now also guaranteed for users not useing a package manager (you would be suprised!!)\n- using templates streamlines the way default settings are passed to ES\n- also there are way less surprises, lets say you create an index with a template and the template sets `index.number_of_replicas: 2` but in your yaml you have `index.number_of_replicas: 0` the latter will never have any effect since templates are superseding node configurations. \n\n> Is there a new file to declare index level settings in? Or must you update each index's settings through an API call?\n\n@mitchswaldman you can user templates for this so it's a single API call and it's persistent across restarts. You don't need to update existing indices since the settings in the yaml file are just defaults.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/230243994","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18073#issuecomment-230243994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18073","id":230243994,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDI0Mzk5NA==","user":{"login":"t3chn0m4g3","id":4318452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTg0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4318452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chn0m4g3","html_url":"https://github.com/t3chn0m4g3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chn0m4g3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chn0m4g3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chn0m4g3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chn0m4g3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chn0m4g3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chn0m4g3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chn0m4g3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chn0m4g3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t3chn0m4g3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-04T09:14:26Z","updated_at":"2016-07-04T09:14:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@s1monw Thank you for sharing a much appreciated and detailed answer!\nI think it makes a lot of sense, however for me it complicates things.
