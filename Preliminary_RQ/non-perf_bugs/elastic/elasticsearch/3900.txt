When disabled, it returns the nested documents as stated. It is the default enabled state that I find confusing. I cannot come up with a test case where the block join would return any documents. The integration tests in SimpleNestedTests disable the join option.\n\nI have not yet profiled the code, but I suspect that the code in NestedQueryParser is constructing a ToParentBlockJoinQuery with an incorrect parentFilter, probably the default NonNestedDocsFilter.INSTANCE.\n\nIf this is not a bug, can the tests be updated to include an example where the default join is enabled and returns documents? There are a few assertions that are commented out in SimpleNestedTests related to join queries.\n","closed_by":{"login":"brusic","id":354105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/354105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic","html_url":"https://github.com/brusic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brusic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
