Also, if percentage is used, allow to set `min_index_buffer_size` (defaults to `48mb`) and `max_index_buffer_size` which defaults to unbounded.\n\nThe indexing buffer size is divided between all the different shards. So, if there are 5 shards allocated, each will have `index_buffer_size / 5` indexing buffer size.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
