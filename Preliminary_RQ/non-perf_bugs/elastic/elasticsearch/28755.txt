The problem for us is that our regex `someRegexHere` isn't constant and is supplied via params. Performing a `Pattern p = Pattern.compile(params.someRegexHere);` doesn't seem to work since Patterns.compile() isn't exposed. \r\n\r\nAny attempt to create a pattern results in errors like\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.util.regex.Pattern\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown call [compile] with [1] arguments on type [Pattern].\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing `Pattern delimiter = /params.someRegexHere/;` doesn't throw an error and the Painless code doesn't work as expected. \r\n\r\nIs there another way to do this? \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1.  in python, \r\n```\r\nes_connection.put_script(\r\n                lang=\"painless\", id=\"my_script\",\r\n                body={\"script\": \"any painless code that attempts to convert String to Pattern\"}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n 2. query similar to the following\r\n```\r\n{'query': {'bool': {'filter': [{'term': {'seq': 'seq10'}}]}},\r\n 'sort': [{'_script': {'order': 'asc',\r\n                       'script': {'id': 'my_script',\r\n                                  'lang': 'painless',\r\n                                  'params': {'someRegexHere': '\\._'}},\r\n                       'type': 'string'}}]}\r\n```\r\n 3. \r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
