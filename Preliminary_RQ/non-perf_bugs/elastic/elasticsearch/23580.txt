This has the undesirable side-effect of enforcing bootstrap checks.\r\n\r\nI understand the benefit of these bootstrap checks in production, but I question the assumption that you must be in production if you're binding to a non-local address, especially given the prevalence of docker. Having to modify the host to set `vm.max_map_count`, for example, severely limits the portability of my test environment for no real reason. It would be useful to be able to set a configuration setting explicitly indicating I am *not* in production and that the bootstrap checks are therefore unnecessary, rather than binding the assumption of development vs production to the hostname to which we choose to bind.","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
