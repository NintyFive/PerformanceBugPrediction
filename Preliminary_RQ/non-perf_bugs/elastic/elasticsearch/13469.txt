Parsing the explanation tree is not really an option as it's cumbersome, error-prone, and slow (explanations bloat up the response quite a bit).\n\nThere is `script_fields` but it doesn't seem like it's possible to call arbitrary function score queries (e.g. a decay function).\n\nTo give an example, I'd like to run something like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"script_fields\": {\n    \"pepe\": {\n      \"random_score\": {\n        \"seed\": 123\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhere [`random_score`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-function-score-query.html#function-random) could be any function score query.\n\nor alternatively being able to run any arbitrary function score as part of a script:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"script_fields\": {\n    \"pepe\": {\n      \"script\": \"function_queries.random_score(123)\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
