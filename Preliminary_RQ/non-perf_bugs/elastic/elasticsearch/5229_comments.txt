I could add overwritting these parameters with the request parameters like in e.g RestIndicesStatsAction, but for this I would need to introduce setter and internal field for indicesOptions in ClusterStateRequest. \n\nMost of the index-related actions inherit this from BroadcastOperationRequest, but since the ClusterStateRequest extends MasterNodeReadOperationRequest, theres no such setter / internal field here. Wondering where to put it. If the \"expand_wildcard\" parameter is supposed to work for all Cluster-related commands, then I think it should be somewhere higher up in the hierarchy. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/69617895","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5229#issuecomment-69617895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5229","id":69617895,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjE3ODk1","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-12T18:21:56Z","updated_at":"2015-01-12T18:21:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I just saw that ClusterSearchShardsRequest is doing the same thing I would do in  ClusterStateRequest:\n\n```\nprivate IndicesOptions indicesOptions = IndicesOptions.lenientExpandOpen();\npublic ClusterSearchShardsRequest indicesOptions(IndicesOptions indicesOptions) \n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/69713456","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5229#issuecomment-69713456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5229","id":69713456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NzEzNDU2","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-13T08:57:15Z","updated_at":"2015-01-13T08:57:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey @cbuescher what you proposed sounds good to me, let's add the ability to set `IndicesOptions` to `ClusterStateRequest`.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/69888580","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5229#issuecomment-69888580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5229","id":69888580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODg4NTgw","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-14T09:16:13Z","updated_at":"2015-01-14T09:16:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"From reading the documentation above on multi-index parameters I guess that also \"ignore_unavailable\" and \"allow_no_indices\" should work here.
