The purpose of this issue is to formulate constructive questions and restate known facts about the Elasticsearch documentation, the upcoming book and community contribution process (not talking about source code contributions). And possibly clarify confusions and misunderstading. Any comments and further questions are warmly welcome.\n#### The Book\n1. Elasticsearch team works on a book. Elasticsearch team has been in negotiation with major publisher for some time now and until the deal is closed it is not possible to share any content that has been written so far. Thus it is also not possible to accept contributions or any public feedback now.\n2. If it is that hard to close the deal and it takes a lot of time to finalise it, is it then worth the effort at all? Wouldn't it be simply more useful to consider a different means of publishing? (Still, looking from the point of the community)\n3. Is there any plan to allow community contributions to the book now or in the future?\n#### The Documentation\n1. What is the relation of the book and the documentation? If the book is published, does it mean it will replace current documentation or some parts of it? Meaning current documentation content will be thrashed? (Available only in git repo history)\n2. If it is publicly unknown what the book license, scope and relation to the documentation will be isn't there a risk that this uncertainty will discourage ppl from contributing to existing documentation? (Because their contribution effort could be virtually wasted anytime once the book deal is closed)\n#### Community Contributions\n1. As of now, contributing to the documentation/guide is possible via GitHub PR. It is up to committers (effectively Elasticsearch.com employees) to judge if it can be accepted. However, if it is not accepted a clear and honest explanation should be provided in comments. That is IMO the only way how to help the contributor do better next time and help cultivate contribution culture going forward.\n2. If accepted contribution is found outdated or buggy later a fix should be preferred over silent content drop. At least it should be possible for the original/main contributor to find out what was wrong and what was the reason of content removal.\n3. There used to be a Tutorials section in the past (seems now partly moved to a .org/blog). Are people welcome to contribute here too? The point here is that some contributions may simply not fit existing guide format (of example the content is too long or it covers more topics). If people want to contribute such content, what is the process?\n4. The more detailed and practically oriented the contributed content is the better. One should not really worry about the fact that his/her contribution will not be accepted because it might be too overlapping or competitive to commercial training materials. (I am not saying training materials should be freely available, but what if someone creates good material and wants to share it with others via official channel?)\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukas-vlcek","id":205174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/205174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek","html_url":"https://github.com/lukas-vlcek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
