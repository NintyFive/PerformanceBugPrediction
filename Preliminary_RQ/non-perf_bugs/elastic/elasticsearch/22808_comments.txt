The reason seems to be that for the cacheKey computation we use ShardSearchLocalRequest#innerWriteTo which in turn deserialized the SearchSourceBuilder. While debugging I saw differences in the cacheKey bytes array where the source was rendered. Looking closer at the SearchSourceBuilder for this seed I found that the `source().collapse().getInnerHit()` renders to xContent in different ways in the order of the `scriptField` keys, because they are interenally stored as an unordered Set. Temporarily changing these to an ordered Set solved the problem for this particular seed.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
