Instead this should use the method's parameter \"builderParams\".\n\nI tried modifying the [SimpleSortTests](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/209860854ddc87ff71a49d9ced1186a8e2c8e3b8/modules/lang-groovy/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/messy/tests/SimpleSortTests.java#L575), one of our messy tests, to demonstrate the issue - except apparently the additional json that's being generated doesn't bother [SortParseElement's](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/76fa9023b6378681de34672d2e94227e8b464cfd/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/sort/SortParseElement.java) parsing method so the test above remained green. So not sure if this should be considered a bug and fixed for 2.x.\n\nWill post a test as PR showing the difference in json generated depending on whether script params are set or not shortly.\n","closed_by":{"login":"MaineC","id":70953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/70953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC","html_url":"https://github.com/MaineC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
