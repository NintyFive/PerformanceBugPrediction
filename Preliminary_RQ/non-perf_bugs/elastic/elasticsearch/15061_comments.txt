When we recover a primary, we reach out to all the nodes in the cluster and select the best copy we find (in order to make sure we don't select stale copies). In order to make this effective we require to see at least a quorum of the possible copies (i.e., number of replicas +1 ) with a special case for 2.  Since the number of replicas is increased and the cluster is shut down before ES is able to make more copies, a new primary is not elected. \n\nThis will be fixed once we complete the work on #14739 . I'm closing this for now, as a duplicate of #14739 where github nicely refers back to this. Feel free to reopen if there is anything else.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/160667827","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15061#issuecomment-160667827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15061","id":160667827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDY2NzgyNw==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-30T15:49:11Z","updated_at":"2015-11-30T15:49:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"sorry, mis read the ticket and thought you had more then 1 replica.
