Computing exact percentiles is not reasonably feasible as it would require shards to stream all values to the node that coordinates search execution, which could be gigabytes on a high-cardinality field. On the other hand, t-digest allows to trade accuracy for memory by trying to summarize the set of values that have been accumulated with interesting properties/features:\n- compression is configurable, meaning that if you can configure it to have better accuracy at the cost of a higher memory usage,\n- accuracy is excellent for extreme percentiles,\n- percentiles are going to be accurate if few values were accumulated.\n\nExample:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"aggs\" : {\n        \"load_time_outlier\" : {\n            \"percentiles\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"load_time\",\n                \"percents\" : [95, 99, 99.9] \n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
