However, the example in the README, and the usage in test files has an incorrect order -- it precedes the _operation_ in the `do` section:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- do:\r\n        warnings:\r\n            - '[index] is deprecated'\r\n            - ...\r\n        get:\r\n            index:    test\r\n            type:    test\r\n            id:        1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `warnings` clause should come _after_ the `get` operation here (as opposed to the `catch` clause, where it makes sense to list it first, respecting the usual programming language notation).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n/cc @elastic/es-clients ","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
