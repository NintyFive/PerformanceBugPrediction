I'd like to use an Index Template to automatically add the Index Alias Filter to the Logstash indices when they are created.\n\nHowever, the template-added alias filters return inconsistent results, as you can see by running my Gist recreation https://gist.github.com/cvializ/0a494579e19e645ecd4a\n\nA manually created index alias filter returns the correct results as expected.
