I'm not sure about the `NodeStatsCollector` errors, but the assertion error that tripped highlights an internal error. \r\n\r\n@bleskes I've looked into how this would be possible, i.e., how we could end up with a translog that's closed, while the engine is not closed yet, and while there is no tragic event on the index writer. I think one candidate which might violate this is `rollGeneration` (and also the new `trimOperations` (which is not in the above version yet)).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/410331988","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32526#issuecomment-410331988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32526","id":410331988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDMzMTk4OA==","user":{"login":"TinLe","id":465041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTA0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/465041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TinLe","html_url":"https://github.com/TinLe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TinLe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TinLe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TinLe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TinLe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TinLe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TinLe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TinLe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TinLe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TinLe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-03T18:03:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-03T18:03:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We have two more nodes (different nodes than last time) died with same fatal thread error.\r\n\r\nAnything we can do?
