This ultimately results in all shard copies containing a single segment that look different from one another (e.g the primary might have segment `_c`, while the replica might have segment `_e`).\r\n\r\nIt might be better to only forcemerge the primary shard --> then recover the replicas, resulting in identical segments for all shard copies.\r\n\r\nSeveral benefits come to mind:\r\n\r\n* Having \"different\" looking segments amongst shard copies can result in excessive Snapshot repo disk usage (e.g replica gets promoted to primary and its single segment looks different so it gets backed up in full).\r\n* Should avoid the \"bouncing results\" problem.\r\n* Less load on nodes hosting replicas (assuming a recovery is cheaper than full blown merging)","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
