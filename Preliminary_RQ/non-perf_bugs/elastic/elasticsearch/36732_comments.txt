What's happening is that an IndexRequest that was just indexed into the primary is mutated for replication, but if we then bubble up to the ReroutePhase (on same node) because of retry, we will be sending the mutated request to another primary, which makes things go *boom* like in the above assertion. Fixing this would require substantial changes to 5.x, which we can't make. I'm inclined to close this one as WontFix.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/448189547","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36732#issuecomment-448189547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36732","id":448189547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODE4OTU0Nw==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-18T11:29:12Z","updated_at":"2018-12-18T11:29:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed. `WONTFIX` it is.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
