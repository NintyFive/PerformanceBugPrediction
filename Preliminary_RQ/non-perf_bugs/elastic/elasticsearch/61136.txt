User needs generate their own hllsketch binary data and write to a binary data field.\r\nOn contrary, To use cardinality aggregation, User just put data to a keyword, long...etc field.\r\n\r\nThis function is not coverd by cardinality aggregation.\r\nThis plugin is used for pre-aggregation situation.(Pre-aggregation sketch data is generated by user themselves)\r\nPlease reconsider this pr. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @nooneuse in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61006#issuecomment-673926596_","closed_by":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
