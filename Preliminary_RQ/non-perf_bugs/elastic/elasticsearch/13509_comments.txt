Is this useful or not? And bonus question 2:\n> Is 110 shards on 4 stations madness?\n\nHaving indices with one single type instead of different types on the same index makes sense. 110 shards on 4 machines starts to be a lot however, depending on the size of your shards. If they are already large (several GB) then this might be fine, but if they are small you should probably consider reducing the number of shards.\n\nPlease use [the forums](http://discuss.elastic.co) for questions in the future. These issues are for bugs and feature requests.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
