The `path_match` allows to set full matching including the concatenated \"path\" up to the field. In a similar to `unmatch`, there is also an option for `path_unmatch`. For example, using the following data:\n\n```\n{\n    \"_id\" : \"1\",\n    \"name\" : \"top_level\",\n    \"obj1\" : {\n        \"name\" : \"obj1_level\",\n        \"obj2\" : {\n            \"name\" : \"obj2_level\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe following mapping can now be applied:\n\n```\n{\n    \"person\" : {\n        \"dynamic_templates\" : [\n            {\n                \"template_1\" : {\n                    \"path_match\" : \"obj1.obj2.*\",\n                    \"mapping\" : {\n                        \"store\" : \"no\"\n                    }\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"template_2\" : {\n                    \"path_match\" : \"obj1.*\",\n                    \"mapping\" : {\n                        \"store\" : \"yes\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
