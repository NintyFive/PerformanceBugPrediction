You have to add it to the runlevels yourself. The [reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-repositories.html) even tells you how.\n\nI've added the discuss label. It seems like for the most part deb packaged start their services on install but that isn't a super popular thing. Some packages don't do it and some people hate it when packages do that.

Apparently this is debian policy though. I can't find where in the [policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) it says that but the internet seems to think its in there somewhere.\n\nI'm fine with saying \"We've thought this through.
