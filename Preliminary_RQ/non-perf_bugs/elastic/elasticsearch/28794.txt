The 1min might be too short perhaps, but a set of time period metrics would be great to begin with.\r\n\r\nThis will allow some time context to the rejected metrics in the case that a user isn't logging these metrics historically in a monitoring system.","closed_by":{"login":"geekpete","id":2070843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2070843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekpete","html_url":"https://github.com/geekpete","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekpete/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekpete/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekpete/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekpete/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekpete/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekpete/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekpete/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekpete/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geekpete/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
