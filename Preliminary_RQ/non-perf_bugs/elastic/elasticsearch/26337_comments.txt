I think you mean that we should move the recovery logic around that request to be async with callbacks rather than the blocking logic. This will be a big effort and we have other plans for this code. That said - it is currently run on the generic thread pool which can spawn all the thread it needs. Also, recovery is throttled both on source and target, so each node will only have a few outgoing requests.  I'm going to close this now. Feel free to reopen and explain more if I misunderstood. Please also include information (with numbers) about your concrete issue if so.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/324266497","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26337#issuecomment-324266497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26337","id":324266497,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDI2NjQ5Nw==","user":{"login":"keenbo","id":1872588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1872588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenbo","html_url":"https://github.com/keenbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenbo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-23T08:57:18Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T08:57:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@bleskes ok, thanks \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
