But this, on an operational level, has two possible implications - \nIt can be that some shards are missing but there's a quorum to all indexes so the cluster is \"writable\".\nIt can also mean that some indexes don't have a quorum in which case those writes will fail. \n\nThis is a huge difference on an operational level. \n\nWe need a way to know (and monitor) the real state of the cluster - knowing not only that all primaries are up, but also if there's a quorum.\n\nA possible way can be to add another color, for instance - \nyellow - some replicas are missing but you have a quorum\norange - primary up but no quorum\n\nOr use another indicator altogether.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
