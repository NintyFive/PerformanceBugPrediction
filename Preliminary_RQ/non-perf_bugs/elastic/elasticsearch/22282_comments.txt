I wonder why we don't have a node seed that can be used for any random event. Wondering what people think about that.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/268277169","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22282#issuecomment-268277169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22282","id":268277169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODI3NzE2OQ==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T15:47:28Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T15:47:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I also did not realize that we can use `RandomizedContext.runWithPrivateRandomness()`. Code run in that way will retrieve a private random through random(), and this way we make sure that node initialization doesn't affect other randomess in test methods. Will update #22283 accordingly, with that fix `Randomness.get()` is perfectly fine.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
