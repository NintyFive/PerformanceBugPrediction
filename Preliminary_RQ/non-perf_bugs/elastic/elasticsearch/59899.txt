We generally would make the relevant QL functions case sensitive, then we would subclass and change the handling.\r\n\r\nIt's an odd pattern, and we could instead make the Configuration provide `isCaseSensitive()`, defaulting to `true`, and refer to it when determine which mode to handle a function. I think it simplifies the code a bit and makes it easier to extend to new functions.","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
