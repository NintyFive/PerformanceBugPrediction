Are you using spinning disks, that would be a contributing factor. Also, you haven't specified what you mean by \"abnormal\" IO utilization (nor how you're measuring it).\r\n\r\nElastic provides a [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) for asking general questions and instead prefers to use GitHub only for verified bug reports and feature requests. There's an active community there that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\nI would ask you to provide the above information in any topic that you open there.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
