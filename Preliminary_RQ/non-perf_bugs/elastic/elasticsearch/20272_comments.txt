Dots in field names in 5.0 work well, I am not saying there are no bugs, but at least we know how we can make it work.

The fact that we won't do any harm if the setting is not provided is why I think this is not a problem. it's an upgrade path for affected users. users that didn't have that problem should really not have an easy time to enable it. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/288093444","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20272#issuecomment-288093444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20272","id":288093444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODA5MzQ0NA==","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-21T14:22:19Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T14:22:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing as it was intentional the setting was made this way","performed_via_github_app":null}]
