In Chrome it doesn't work, it always gives me a JavaScript-level error back saying `Empty response from server: 0`.  In Chrome's JavaScript console I see: `XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://127.0.0.1:9200/droopy/summary/_search. Request header field Content-Type is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers.`\n\nHere's the output from `tcpdump` on port 9200:\n\n<pre>\nOPTIONS /droopy/summary/_search HTTP/1.1\nHost: 127.0.0.1:9200\nConnection: keep-alive\nReferer: http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html?srv=127.0.0.1:9200\nAccess-Control-Request-Method: POST\nOrigin: http://127.0.0.1:8000\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_6) AppleWebKit/534.24 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/11.0.696.3 Safari/534.24\nAccess-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\nAccept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3\n</pre><pre>\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAccess-Control-Max-Age: 1728000\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT, DELETE\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 0\n</pre>\n\n\nI can see two problems:\n1. In my AJAX request, I specify `Content-Type: application/json`, and because of that Chromes includes it in the pre-flight request header `Access-Control-Request-Headers` (see http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ â€“ search for that header name, it's explained).  ElasticSearch should include `Content-Type` in the header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` in its pre-flight response, in addition to `X-Requested-With`.\n2. My request is a `POST` request, but ElasticSearch seems to allow only `PUT` and `DELETE` as shown by its `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header in the response.\n\nThankfully, I can easily work around this bug by not setting the `Content-Type` header in my request.  It seems that as of today, the 2nd point above doesn't prevent Chrome from sending the request, but I don't think that's normal, so I'd recommend fixing it too in order to prevent future breakages once Chrome becomes stricter about enforcing CORS headers.\n\nThe only other browser I tested was Firefox 3.6.15 and it didn't care about any of that.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
