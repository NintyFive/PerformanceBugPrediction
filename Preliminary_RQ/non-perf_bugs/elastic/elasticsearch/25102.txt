Mapping (real type additional data, but property we are querying is only `id` of type `integer`)\r\n```\r\nPUT perf_problem_index\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"my_type\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"id\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 2. Items (**~10 million** items)\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT perf_problem_index/my_type/1\r\n{\r\n  \"id\" : 1\r\n}\r\n\r\nPUT perf_problem_index/my_type/2\r\n{\r\n  \"id\" : 2\r\n}\r\n\r\nPUT perf_problem_index/my_type/3\r\n{\r\n  \"id\" : 3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n 3.
