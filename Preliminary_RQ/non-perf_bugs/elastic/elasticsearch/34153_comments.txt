This *might* a bug with Elasticsearch but usually things like this are environmental and you can track them down by looking at the logs in `/var/log/elasticsearch`. If that isn't helpful then please post about this on https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch with the contents of the logs or reproduction steps from a clean install or something like that. Sorry I couldn't be of more help!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
