I want to allow the user to add their words to the dictionary by using a supplementary dictionary. And I want a flexible way of handling this custom list.\n\nUsing the standard Settings implementation isn't a valid option since this is can be a list of many words, each word having some additional descriptors, so its not a string suitable for storing in settings.\n\nOne possibility is to provide the analyzer with a path of some sort via settings, but to be able to run on the cloud using SaaS providers this is not a good option. Another option is to provide a download link, but again - I don't want my Analyzer downloading the internet on initialization, plus that may be a security breach.\n\nInstead, I'm interested in a way to leverage ES as a document store. Loading a document with this configuration seems optimal considering all options, but I'm not sure if it is supported at all. If it is - would love to hear how; otherwise, would love to see this added.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
