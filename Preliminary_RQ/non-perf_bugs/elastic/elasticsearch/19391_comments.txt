The former is the original name, and the latter was added because `.yaml` is the official extension (according to yaml.org).  While I understand that `.yml` has been around much longer, I think we should make our single configuration file name use `.yaml`. In addition to it being the official extension, I have also been bit before when writing rest tests and accidentally using `.yml`, because I had just been editing an `elasticsearch.yml` file.\n\nIn all 3 cases (.yml, json and properties), I think we can do this cleanly for the user by looking for the older file names on startup, and throwing an error. In 2.0, we already switched to failing if there was more than one file available. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/232093013","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19391#issuecomment-232093013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19391","id":232093013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjA5MzAxMw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-12T15:55:04Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T15:55:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> While I understand that `.yml` has been around much longer, I think we should make our single configuration file name use `.yaml`.\n\n+1\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/232650428","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19391#issuecomment-232650428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19391","id":232650428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjY1MDQyOA==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T12:23:39Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T12:23:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Relates #9706\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
