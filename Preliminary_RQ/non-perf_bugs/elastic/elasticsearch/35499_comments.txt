The issue is that because remote connections are not established synchronously when registering a new remote host, the check to `GET /_remote/info` races connections being established. This is the same in 6.8 and 7.x/master. The difference is how the remote info is reported. On 6.8, `seeds` is returning an empty list when there isn't a connection to any node yet, whereas 7.x/master already reports the entry.\r\n\r\nThis means that the test response replacement `// TEST[s/127.0.0.1:9300/$body.leader.seeds.0/]` works for 7.x/master, but not 6.x. Unfortunately, the REST test framework does not allow to specify a more powerful pattern here. As such, I'm closing this issue as wontfix. The TESTRESPONSE is not verifying much anyway, as nearly all the fields are mocked.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
