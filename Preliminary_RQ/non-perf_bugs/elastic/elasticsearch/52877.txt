A problem has been identified that means these indices do not show up correctly in `_cat/indices` when security is enabled - see #52304.  The solution that is being implemented is to introduce the concept of hidden aliases.  This work is ongoing in #52547.\r\n\r\nBefore 7.7 feature freeze ML will need to make all aliases on our hidden indices into hidden aliases.  (Or, if this is not possible in time for 7.7, remove the `index.hidden` setting from the indices we've added it to so far and try again in 7.8.)","closed_by":{"login":"przemekwitek","id":19312454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzEyNDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19312454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek","html_url":"https://github.com/przemekwitek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
