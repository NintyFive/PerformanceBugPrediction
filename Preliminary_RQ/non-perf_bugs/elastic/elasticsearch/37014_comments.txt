test failed, because the follower shard didn't have the expected global checkpoint. This test changes the remote cluster connection that running shard follow tasks are using. Previously (at the time the test failed) shard follow tasks could fail with a non retryable error, which causes the shard follow tasks to stop. Recently a change was merged (#37239) that makes shard follow tasks more resilient against remote cluster connections changes. I think that this will fix this test too, I will re-enable this test soon.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/454004523","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37014#issuecomment-454004523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37014","id":454004523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDAwNDUyMw==","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-14T13:29:04Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T13:29:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've umuted this test on master: de852765d6bd7d06497cb15136c8b61bfa93744c\r\nI will backport that commit to 6.x and 6.6 if no failures occur in the coming days.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/454391154","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37014#issuecomment-454391154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37014","id":454391154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDM5MTE1NA==","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-15T13:26:28Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T13:26:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing, please feel free to reopen if this test starts to fail again.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
