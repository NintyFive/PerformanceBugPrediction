strange errors and it is due to this line https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/plugins/PluginsService.java#L358\n.\nThese errors appeared strange because a week ago I checkedout code\nand it just worked amazingly as expected .. but I don't know what happened all of  sudden.\nso I just wanted to check if I can proceed if I bypass the error by commenting that line.\nbut I then landed up in this exact error which someone else too caught ..pls see this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30837055/elastic-search-error .\n\nok some things is strange .... \nif this is so strange and it is not worth going further in this direction, at least tell me how you guys debug elastic search code in eclipse.\nI can set a debug point by doing a remote debug in eclipse. for that I need to run elastic search in debug mode. But I don't know where it is to set the debug = yes and port on which to java vm runs so that I can add that port to eclipse ... I searched in config too ..\ncan you point me to some docs or wiki . That would be great help ..\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/129142545","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12737#issuecomment-129142545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12737","id":129142545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTE0MjU0NQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-09T09:02:14Z","updated_at":"2015-08-09T09:02:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @HarishAtGitHub \n\nI run ES in Eclipse with these VM arguments:\n\n```\n-Xms256m -Xmx1g -Djava.awt.headless=true -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=75 -XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=logs/heapdump.hprof -Delasticsearch -Des.foreground=yes -ea -Des.path.home=/Users/clinton/workspace/elasticsearch/core/ -Des.security.manager.enabled=false -Des.http.cors.enabled=true -Des.http.cors.allow-origin=*\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/129143704","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12737#issuecomment-129143704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12737","id":129143704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTE0MzcwNA==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-09T09:15:05Z","updated_at":"2015-08-09T09:15:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@clintongormley i think we should add this info to the TESTING doc.
