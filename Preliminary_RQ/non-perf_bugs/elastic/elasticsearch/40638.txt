One thing that would be helpful, however, is to know how a snapshot originated (like which policy created the snapshot).\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could extend the `CreateSnapshotRequest` (and optionally the REST layer) to allow providing an \"origin\" (or metadata, if we want to be more generic) string when creating the snapshot. This would then show up when the snapshot was listed from the repository.\r\n\r\n/cc @original-brownbear ","closed_by":{"login":"gwbrown","id":1522844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjI4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1522844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/gwbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
