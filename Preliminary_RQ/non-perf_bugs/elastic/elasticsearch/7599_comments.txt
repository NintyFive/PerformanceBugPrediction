That solves half the problem right there. Now I'm curious why the auto-generated names don't work.\n\nHere's my use case. My company wants an elasticsearch ZIP bundled with some of the common elasticsearch plugins and some of the configuration preset including the logging file names. The goal is to have the bundle work in production and locally if you want to run it on your own computer. In production I will be configuring the node.name in elasticsearch.yml so that would work but I don't want to preset the name for people running it locally.\n\nIt looks like it already partially supports it. It just needs a fix to pick up the auto-generated name.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62128988","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7599#issuecomment-62128988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7599","id":62128988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTI4OTg4","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-07T11:13:49Z","updated_at":"2014-11-07T11:13:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @erikringsmuth \n\nGiven that a new node name is generated on every restart, it doesn't seem to make sense to use these auto-generated names for logging.  I think we're going to leave this as it is: just set the node names manually if you want to use those names for logging.\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
