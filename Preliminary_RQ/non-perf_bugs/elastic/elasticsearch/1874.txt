This is not what I want, when I shutdown the whole cluster.\n\nAfter starting the whole cluster, many shards get re-initialized and re-balanced, which is not necessary (because data should be consistent).\nBut since it is not possible to start up all nodes exactly at once (within the same \"nanosecond\" ;-) ), it would be nice to have a \"cluster startup feature\". All nodes should wait for all other nodes to start up and setup the cluster again without too much re-initialization and re-balancing.\n\nRobert\n","closed_by":{"login":"snazy","id":957468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NzQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/957468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy","html_url":"https://github.com/snazy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
