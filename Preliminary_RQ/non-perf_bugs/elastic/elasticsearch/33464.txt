just spent a significant amount of time figuring out why Active Directory / LDAP stops working after upgrading from ES 5.6 to ES 6.4.\r\n\r\nThe reason is:\r\n- in ES 6.2 (with x-pack), the default path for role_mapping.yml is ES_PATH_CONF/x-pack/role_mapping.yml (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/security-settings.html)\r\n- in ES 6.3 (no x-pack), the default path for role_mapping.yml is ES_PATH_CONF/role_mapping.yml (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-settings.html)\r\n\r\nWe did not find any explicit documentation of this change, even though it did actually break functionality.\r\nIn particular, also the Interactive Upgrade Guide should highlight these and similar required changes.","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
