It does feel more practical to return the nested `_source` without the prefix.  Either way, it's a breaking change (which already landed in 6.0.0-beta2 in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/26102).  I really wouldn't want to break this again in 7.0.  My inclination is to fix this in rc2.\r\n\r\n/cc @mattweber ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
