It looks like this:\n\n```\nrequest [GET http://127.0.0.1:9201_cluster/health] returned [HTTP/1.1 200 OK]\n```\n\nIt should be like this:\n\n```\nrequest [GET http://127.0.0.1:9201/_cluster/health] returned [HTTP/1.1 200 OK]\n```\n\nThe executed request is like this:\n\n```\n            Response response = client.performRequest(\n                    \"GET\",\n                    \"_cluster/health\",\n                    new Hashtable<>(),\n                    null);\n```\n\nI do not enter the slash before cluster, but it works, so the logs should add the slash as well.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
