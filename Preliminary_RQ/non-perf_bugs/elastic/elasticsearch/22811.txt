Elasticsearch supports 4 different formats: json, yaml, smile and cbor. All 4 are supported with few exceptions: bulk, msearch and friends only support json or smile (actually multi line json or smile composed of one valid object per line, the whole request is never valid json nor smile).\r\n\r\nGiven that the majority of our users use json, that we barely test the other formats, especially the binary ones, and that handling 4 different formats complicates our code, not to mention in some places we may completely forget about this and just assume that we get json, I wonder if we still want to support all these 4 formats.\r\n\r\nI think the outcome of this issue should be either deprecate and then remove support for yaml, smile and cbor, or invest in adding coverage for these formats so that we feel more comfortable about supporting them. All said also applies to both requests and responses.","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
