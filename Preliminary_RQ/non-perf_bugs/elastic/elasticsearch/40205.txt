At this point the only\r\n safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work \"fix\" this:\r\n\r\n     1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n     2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working\r\n        upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer\r\n        distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the\r\n        packages for the previous distribution release still work).\r\n\r\n     3. Run the command with the repository temporarily disabled\r\n            yum --disablerepo=<repoid> ...\r\n\r\n     4. Disable the repository permanently, so yum won't use it by default. Yum\r\n        will then just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it\r\n        again or use --enablerepo for temporary usage:\r\n\r\n            yum-config-manager --disable <repoid>\r\n        or\r\n            subscription-manager repos --disable=<repoid>\r\n\r\n     5. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.\r\n        Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,\r\n        so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much\r\n        slower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nice\r\n        compromise:\r\n\r\n            yum-config-manager --save --setopt=<repoid>.skip_if_unavailable=true\r\n\r\nCannot find a valid baseurl for repo: base/7/x86_64\r\n\u001B[0mCould not retrieve mirrorlist http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=7&arch=x86_64&repo=os&infra=container error was\r\n12: Timeout on http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=7&arch=x86_64&repo=os&infra=container: (28, 'Operation too slow.
