This is due to the implementation of Gradle's `JavaVersion`, which only has a value for the JDK version one newer than the latest at the time the version of gradle was released. \r\n\r\nThis is problematic for build failures that only occur with a specific version of Java. For example, #57749 only occurs under JDK 15 yet blindly running the reproduce line found in the scan https://gradle-enterprise.elastic.co/s/h2zdsinitnabi will result in the test passing when the reproduce line would reproduce the failure if the correct runtime java value was reported.\r\n\r\nTechnically this issue could also occur on master and 7.x but we are keeping more up to date with gradle versions on those branches.","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
