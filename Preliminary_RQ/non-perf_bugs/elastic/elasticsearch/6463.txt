I do a filter or query, and set the size valeu to a huge value (like 10000000), the memory consuption is increased a lot even though the final result be 10 documents.\n\nIf I do the same thing with a huge amount of users the memory is increased so fast that the nodes would become bottlenecks (sometimes a node shutdowns itself).\n\nI solved that changing the size attribute to a low value, but I think it would be better if the ES deal with that in a better way, avoiding bad programmers to shutdown the
