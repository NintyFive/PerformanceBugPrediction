The frequency metric is calculated based on the term-document matrix.\n\nI tried overriding DefaultSimilarity.Java. The class contains the term frequency, document frequency information. But, the mapping of the term frequency to the term and document is missing in that class.\n\nI tried using ScoreFunctionBuilder.Java to modify the scoring at query time. But, the score is independent of term-frequency and only depends on the modified scoring logic. \n\nI want the exact class which calculates the term frequency and document frequency and can we override the class using a plugin. Kindly help me out on this issue.\n\nAlso, the inference from Mastering Elasticsearch Guide book  is that term frequency is calculated and stored at the time of Indexing. If this is correct, please let me know the class which calculates the term frequency at the time of Indexing. Also correct me if I am wrong.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
