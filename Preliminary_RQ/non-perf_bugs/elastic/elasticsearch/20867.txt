It should be reindexed in Elasticsearch 2.x before upgrading to 5.0.0-beta1.\"\n```\n\nIt will be nice to provide additional features:\n- Provide a way for users to easily tell if a snapshot contains previously created indices.   Currently, the snapshot _status API does not include index.version.created information.  It will be nice to include index.version.created and index.version.upgraded as metadata as part of the _status API.\n- Currently snapshot restore fails right away when the list of indices requested contains ones created in versions that it does not support/not compatible with (eg. if a snapshot contains both indices created on 1.x and 2.x, the restore will fail completely).  It will be nice to provide an option to ignore these 1.x snapshots (eg. a flag like ignore_incompatible, ignore_obsolete, etc..).\n","closed_by":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
