Nonetheless, Elasticsearch requires these connections to remain open, and it can disrupt the operation of the cluster if any inter-node connections are closed by an external influence such as a firewall. It is important to configure your network to preserve long-lived idle connections between Elasticsearch nodes, for instance by leaving tcp_keep_alive enabled and ensuring that the keepalive interval is shorter than any timeout that might cause idle connections to be closed, or by setting transport.ping_schedule if keepalives cannot be configured.\r\n\r\nThe docs don't mention how to configure this for any of the supported platforms, and also do not mention concrete values for the system-level keepalive parameters. In particular, the docs state that configuration system-level keepalives is the preferred way.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
