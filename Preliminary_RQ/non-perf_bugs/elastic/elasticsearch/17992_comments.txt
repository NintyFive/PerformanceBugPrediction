No a good choice during search scripts, but such is life. We could even disable it by default in that context.\n\nAnyway, if we have special syntax I think we should copy some language that folks are used to so that we can tell people \"it should work just like X\" and then we have an automatic spec. That being said I'd like to propose we pick between groovy's syntax, perl's syntax, or something else I haven't thought of. Or having no special regex syntax.\n\nThis is my memory of groovy's regex syntax:\n- `/` is a string delimiter.\n- `~STRING` is sugar for `Pattern.compile(STRING)`.\n- `lhs=STRING =~ rhs=STRING` is sugar for `Pattern.compile(rhs).matcher(lhs)`.\n- `lhs=STRING ==~ rhs=STRING` is sugar for `Pattern.compile(rhs).matcher(lhs).matches().\n- Flags live in the front of the pattern and look like `(?i)`\n- Groovy's matchers are Iterable in a kind of messy way I don't think we should copy at all/without some modification.\n\nI like the groovy choice because it is fairly explicit (less magic) and maps fairly easily to Java. And if people are using regexes now with groovy it should mostly \"just work\".\n\nIt looks like perl's syntax is:\n- `/` is a special string delimiter that builds patterns\n- flags go after the last `/`\n- `=~` returns a boolean (or some truthy thing, 5 minutes of internet research isn't an exhaustive study) on match and sets special `$_` and `$1`, `$2`, etc...\n\nI think perl's regex is much more popular than Groovy's syntax and it is fairly \"natural\". Maybe because we're all so used to it. I think the disadvantage of it is that it doesn't map as easily to java with the magic variables. OTOH we can absolutely make them work because we're writing the language.\n\nMaybe because I don't know it as well, I think that perl's regex syntax is deeper and we'd have trouble ever saying \"painless's regexes are just like perl\" because there is so much magic in the language around regexes. Also, our regexes would be java regexes, not perl regexes.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/225382180","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17992#issuecomment-225382180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17992","id":225382180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTM4MjE4MA==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-11T18:33:00Z","updated_at":"2016-06-11T18:33:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, I think that implementing goovy's regex syntax would be a lot easier.
