Using this temporary connection, we retrieve the remote node info via the `TransportLivenessAction`. We use the remove node info to validate the cluster name but also construct a new `DiscoveryNode` object that is identical to the one supplied by the remote node with the exception of the `TransportAddress`. The address of the constructed `DiscoveryNode` is set to the same `TransportAddress` the user supplied. The temporary connection is then closed and the newly constructed `DiscoveryNode` is use to open a full persisted connection using `TransportService.connectToNode`.\r\n\r\nSadly, this flow cause problems with load balancer.  If the supplied address points at a load balancer, the second persistent connection can be routed to a different node than the one the temporary connection was opened to. In that case, the `DiscoveryNode` we got contains different information then the node that accepted persistent connection. In that case, the extra handshaking in the `TransportService` [added in 5.4](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/22828) fails and the added address is rejected. \r\n\r\nWhile the extra validation is important for connections between nodes in the cluster, it is too strict for the transport client and we can relax it in that use case.\r\n\r\nNote that this not relevant if sniffing is enabled. In that case, we can't support a load balancer as we don't know what the right IP should be for the nodes we sniffed.","closed_by":{"login":"tbrooks8","id":862472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjQ3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/862472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrooks8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
