A few users have asked about this, and I can see how it'd be confusing if you assumed it may be copying the mapping and simply reindexing with the latest index format.  It'd be good to add this with an `important` note for this near the top of the documentation\n","closed_by":{"login":"eskibars","id":2246002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDYwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2246002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars","html_url":"https://github.com/eskibars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
