For example, you cannot reindex from a 7.x cluster into a 6.x cluster., can the note be added for all versions of the doc ?\r\n\r\nPer our [backport policy](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/docs#backporting-doc-fixes), we typically only backport doc changes to the current ES version branch. That's why #60425 was only added to the 7.8+ docs. However, I made an exception in this case and backported the #60425 changes to all 7.x branches and 6.8.\r\n\r\n> 2- Reindex from remote documentation currently is lacking the same note for all versions, can it be added at least since 6.8 branch, maybe something like this :\r\n\r\nGood catch! I opened #65207 to add the same note to the remote reindex docs.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
