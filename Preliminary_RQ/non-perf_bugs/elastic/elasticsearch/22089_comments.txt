See that related review comment where it is suggested that we remove the ability to retrieve terms from a `TermsQueryBuilder`: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/21776#discussion_r90214171. For the use-case of enhancing queries, I think a better approach would be to use a completely different abstraction that can then be converted into a `QueryBuilder`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/266382090","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22089#issuecomment-266382090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22089","id":266382090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjM4MjA5MA==","user":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-12T09:34:12Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T09:50:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I don't think it should be a design goal of query builders. \r\n\r\nWhatever decision is made here, there needs to be consistency.
