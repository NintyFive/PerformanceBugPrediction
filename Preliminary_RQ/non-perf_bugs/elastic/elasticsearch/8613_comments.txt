I don't know what you're doing wrong, and you haven't provided all the steps that you are using to demonstrate this problem.\n\nI suggest trying the `explain` API to figure out why your document isn't matching: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-explain.html#search-explain\n\nIf you can recreate a bug, please reopen this ticket.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
