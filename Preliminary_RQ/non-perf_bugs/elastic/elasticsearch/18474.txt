So that's clearly a bug - if the script wanna use a certain service, it should make sure, that the service is up and running - in case of systemd `[[ -d /run/systemd/system ]]` might be a cheap test - but I'm not sure (using systemd) - please read the related documentation!\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\nUse a ubuntu systemd \"in theory capable\" distro like vivid or wily, make it use upstart, i.e. install upstart,upstart-sysv and purge systemd-sysv packages, (perhaps reboot to see that upstart works wrt. to its parameters) and finally run `apt-get purge elasticsearch`.\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n\n```\n> + apt-get purge elasticsearch\nReading package lists...
