The second approach would require that the setting be in OSS to put it into `ESSingleNodeTestCase`, or that we have a single base class that all X-Pack `ESSingleNodeTestCase`s would extend to set the setting there. Neither of those options are attractive to me. The first is not attractive because of the spilling into OSS, and the second is not attractive because of the overhead involved.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/464058239","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38952#issuecomment-464058239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38952","id":464058239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDA1ODIzOQ==","user":{"login":"iverase","id":29038686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDM4Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/29038686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase","html_url":"https://github.com/iverase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-15T13:54:49Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T13:54:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another case:\r\n\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+master+multijob-unix-compatibility/os=sles-12/245/console\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
