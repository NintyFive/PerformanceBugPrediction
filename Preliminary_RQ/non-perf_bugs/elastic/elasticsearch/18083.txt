I am  using the following code to connect to ElasticSearch\n\n```\n import org.elasticsearch.action.search.SearchResponse;\n import org.elasticsearch.client.transport.TransportClient;\n import org.elasticsearch.common.settings.Settings;\n import org.elasticsearch.common.transport.InetSocketTransportAddress;\n import org.elasticsearch.index.query.QueryBuilders;\n import org.elasticsearch.search.SearchHit;\n\n\n public  TransportClient openConnection(String ipAddress, int ipPort) throws UnknownHostException {\n\n    Settings settings = Settings.settingsBuilder().put(\"cluster.name\", \"elasticsearch\").build();\n    TransportClient client = TransportClient.builder().settings(settings).build().\n            addTransportAddress(new InetSocketTransportAddress(InetAddress.getByName(ipAddress), ipPort));\n\n    return client;\n\n}\n```\n\nWhen I run it locally, i.e. `spark-submit --master local[*]` everything runs OK. When I run it in a google cloud spark cluster I get the following Exception: \n\n```\n java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.elasticsearch.threadpool.ThreadPool at \norg.elasticsearch.client.transport.TransportClient$Builder.build(TransportClient.java:133) at \njavaTools.ElasticSearchConnection.openConnection(ElasticSearchConnection.java:24)\n```\n\nThe last referred method (`openConnection`) is the connection described above. \n\nThe code is uploaded to the google cloud using a fat jar created using sbt asssembly, so all libraries used are common. \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
