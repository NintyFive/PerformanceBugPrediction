You can set the `master_timeout` on the REST API, or the `masterNodeTimeout` on the transport API to adjust this. However, note that this only treating the symptoms of the problem, not treating the actual problem. The actual problem is: your cluster state update is taking thirty seconds to process, this is too long. You should fix that. \r\n\r\nWe are not going to remove a timeout here, cluster state updates are single-threaded, we can not block the entire processing pipeline forever for one task, the other tasks in the pipeline (nodes leaving and joining, failing shards, creating indices, etc.) are too important. \r\n\r\nRight now we can not treat this as a bug in Elasticsearch, it's a problem on your side to investigate; it usually boils down to underpowered master nodes, too large of a cluster state, etc. For general questions, we ask that you use the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co). We reserve GitHub for verified bug reports and feature requests.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
