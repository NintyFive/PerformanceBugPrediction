If you are paginating that deeply, it seems to me that usually you would want to do something with the first pages somewhat earlier at some point.\r\n\r\n@cbuescher   Yes, I'm paginating deeply. For example, **I need 10000th~11000th records, and I execute the command below.**\r\n```\r\nGET /kibana_sample_data_logs/_search?scroll=1m&size=1000\r\n{\r\n  \"sort\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"timestamp\": {\r\n        \"order\": \"desc\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**And I get a '_scroll_id', then I execute the command below for 9 times.** So I can get the 10000~11000\r\n```\r\nGET /_search/scroll?scroll_id=DXF1ZXJ5QW5kRmV0Y2gBAAAAAAAAOCcWc1NSVU9INm5TcmlROWZ4SHMtTmFtdw==\r\n```\r\nI get something like that:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"_scroll_id\" : \"DXF1ZXJ5QW5kRmV0Y2gBAAAAAAAAOCcWc1NSVU9INm5TcmlROWZ4SHMtTmFtdw==\",\r\n  \"took\" : 4,\r\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\r\n  \"_shards\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 1,\r\n    \"successful\" : 1,\r\n    \"skipped\" : 0,\r\n    \"failed\" : 0\r\n  },\r\n  \"hits\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : {\r\n      \"value\" : 14074,\r\n      \"relation\" : \"eq\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"max_score\" : null,\r\n    \"hits\" : [\r\n      { ... }\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAs you can see the \"hits\" attribute shows the _source data, but I only need to handle **the last time** that I execute the scroll command. **For the previous 9 times I don't want to transfer the \"hits\" data from server to client, It's totally a waste to bandwidth, mem, cpu.** So give me some power please. That's also in java client or any other clients, I hope only when you need the _source results, you transfer.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/558079705","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49075#issuecomment-558079705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49075","id":558079705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODA3OTcwNQ==","user":{"login":"czhang223","id":24970977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcwOTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/24970977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/czhang223","html_url":"https://github.com/czhang223","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czhang223/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czhang223/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czhang223/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czhang223/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czhang223/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czhang223/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czhang223/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czhang223/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czhang223/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T09:58:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T09:58:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cbuescher Can I have your reply, please?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/558145755","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49075#issuecomment-558145755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49075","id":558145755,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODE0NTc1NQ==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T13:03:43Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T13:03:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've marked this for discussion with the team.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/563334926","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49075#issuecomment-563334926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49075","id":563334926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzMzNDkyNg==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T17:03:56Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T17:03:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@czhang223 can you explain your use case ?
