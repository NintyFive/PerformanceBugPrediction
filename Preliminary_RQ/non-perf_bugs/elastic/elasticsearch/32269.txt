Some CI instances:\r\n\r\n- https://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+ccr+feature-branch-periodic/1002/console\r\n- https://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+ccr+feature-branch-periodic/1000/console\r\n\r\nThese failures can be explained as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A user issues an indexing which will throw an exception in the analyzing phase. Since the IndexingChain fails to process a document,  the DocumentsWriterPerThread will hard-delete that document internally in Lucene on the primary.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2018-07-20T18:04:15,095][DEBUG][o.e.a.b.TransportShardBulkAction] [test][0] failed to execute bulk item (index) BulkShardRequest [[test][0]] containing [index {[test][test][2], source[{\"suggest_context\":{\"input\":\"foo\"}}]}]\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Contexts are mandatory in context enabled completion field [suggest_context]\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. On ES, we make all docs live when reading Lucene changes history (in fact, we can not distinguish between hard-deletes and soft-deletes). If a recovering replica reads the aborted document, it will fail to index that document. In fact, the replica will never be able to complete its recovery.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2018-07-20T18:04:15,148][ERROR][o.e.b.ElasticsearchUncaughtExceptionHandler] [node-1] fatal error in thread [elasticsearch[node-1][generic][T#4]], exiting\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: unexpected failure while replicating translog entry: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Contexts are mandatory in context enabled completion field [suggest_context]\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.indices.recovery.RecoveryTarget.indexTranslogOperations(RecoveryTarget.java:401) ~[elasticsearch-7.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT.jar:7.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.indices.recovery.PeerRecoveryTargetService$TranslogOperationsRequestHandler.messageReceived(PeerRecoveryTargetService.java:458) ~[elasticsearch-7.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT.jar:7.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT]\r\n    at org.elasticsearch.indices.recovery.PeerRecoveryTargetService$TranslogOperationsRequestHandler.messageReceived(PeerRecoveryTargetService.java:448)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we read aborted documents which should never be exposed. This might be a critical problem in CCR and Lucene rollbacks.\r\n\r\n/cc @s1monw and @bleskes","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
