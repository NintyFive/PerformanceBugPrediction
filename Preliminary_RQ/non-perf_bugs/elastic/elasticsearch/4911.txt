Elastic search \"0.90.10\", \"lucene_version\" : \"4.6\"\n\nRelated to https://groups.google.com/d/topic/elasticsearch/TYVqdYQNZVQ/discussion\n\nI am trying to use the new \"simple_query_string\" when I add to the flags \"PHRASE\" I get \"Unknown simple_query_string flag [PHRASE]]\"\n\nHowever If I add the \"ALL\" flag, it seems to work.\n\nExample:\n\n``` sh\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9200/test/_search -d '{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"filtered\": {\n            \"query\": {\n                \"simple_query_string\": {\n                    \"query\": \"horse\",\n

results.\n\nError I am getting, is:\n\n> ElasticSearchIllegalArgumentException[Unknown simple_query_string flag [PHRASE]];\n\nFrom http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html\nIt seems that it should be possible to send in the \"PHRASE\" flag.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
