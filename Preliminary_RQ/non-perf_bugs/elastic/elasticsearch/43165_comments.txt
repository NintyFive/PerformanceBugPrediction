In my instance \"hot\" servers hold 28 days of data. Warm servers (slower disks) hold the rest of the year and still get a good amount of user queries. Cold nodes have slow disks and high ratio of storage to memory, use frozen indices, etc. It's not a problem for me to have curator force merge the index after the rollover happens, I just thought the above seems like a reasonable use case.
