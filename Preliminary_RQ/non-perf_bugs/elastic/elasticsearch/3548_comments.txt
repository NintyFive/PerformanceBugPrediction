This can happen if you start up java client nodes that join the cluster, maybe logstash does that. It seems you have 30 shards but 0 replicas for some reason so all the 30 shards are allocated on that one data node you are talking about, hence you clusterstate is green. In general please ask those kind of questions on the mailing list, this is only for development issues or bugs. \n\nthanks!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
