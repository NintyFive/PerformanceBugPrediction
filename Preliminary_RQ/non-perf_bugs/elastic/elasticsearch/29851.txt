comment by @jkakavas:*\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Meta issue is to help us keep track of the tasks necessary in order to assert FIPS 140-2 Compliance for Elasticsearch and X-Pack\r\n\r\nA short introduction into the needs of FIPS 140-2 Compliance and the initial research into the possibility of becoming compliant is described in LINK REDACTED ( LINK REDACTED and LINK REDACTED )\r\n\r\n- [x] (#28255 #28515) Modify Secure Settings keystore in order to only use FIPS 140 approved algorithms. \r\n- [x] (#30358) Split out the functionality for reading keys/files from CertUtils \r\n- [x] (#32193) Remove BouncyCastle deendency from runtime  (so that users can use BCFIPS for their JVM)\r\n- [x] (#30509) Replace `ReloadableX509KeyManager` and `ReloadableX509TrustManager` with `X509KeyManager`, `X509TrustManager` respectively and implement reloadability(sic) in a higher layer.\r\n- [x] (#30251) Ensure that only FIPS 140-2 approved algorithms are used throughout our code base ( i.e. `org.elasticsearch.license.CryptUtils`, `org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.support.Hasher`  ) \r\n- [x] (#31234) Support PBKDF2 for password hashing and allow configurable algorithm and cost paramater selection\r\n- [x] (#31666)(#31989) Ensure our tests can run in a FIPS 140-2 JVM\r\n- [x] Ensure that we use sufficient lengths for salt and Key values\r\n- [x] Formalize the difference between `FIPS 140-2 Compliant` and `FIPS 140-2 Validated` and determine if there is a need to go down the (hard/expensive/long) road of the latter.\r\n- [x] (https://github.com/elastic/infra/issues/5735) Add CI for ES on a JVM in FIPS Approved mode.\r\n- [x] (#32326) Add `fips_mode` setting and associated bootstrap checks  \r\n- [x] (#32928) Fips
