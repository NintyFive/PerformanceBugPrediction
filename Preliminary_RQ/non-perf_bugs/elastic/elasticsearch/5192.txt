Taking the ellipsoid shape into account would be costly but thanks to [LUCENE-5271](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5271), `SloppyMath.haversin` is now going to use an approximate value of the diameter of the earch at the average of the two latitudes instead of assuming a uniform diameter.
