The reason is that shard-splitting is a bad idea:\n> - Splitting a shard is almost equivalent to reindexing your data. It’s a much heavier process than just copying a shard from one node to another.\n> - Splitting is exponential. You start with one shard, then split into 2, then 4, 8, 16, etc. Splitting doesn’t allow you to increase capacity by just 50%.\n> - Shard splitting requires you to have enough capacity to hold a second copy of your index. Usually, by the time you realise that you need to scale out, you don’t have enough free space left to perform the split.\n> \n> In a way, Elasticsearch does support shard splitting. You can always reindex your data to a new index with the appropriate number of shards (see [Reindexing Your Data](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/reindex.html)). It is still a more intensive process than moving shards around, and still requires enough free space to complete, but at least you can control the number of shards in the new index.\n\nWe still don't want to implement shard splitting for the above reasons, but we do want to make it easier to reindex your data, by implementing a changes API (#1242) and a reindex API (#492).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/66987229","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8912#issuecomment-66987229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8912","id":66987229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTg3MjI5","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-15T12:26:40Z","updated_at":"2014-12-15T12:26:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One thing that might be efficient and reasonable to implement is shard merging from `N to 1` ie in the daily indices case where you want multiple shards for write performance but once you are done one shard is enough. this might be something we will consider in the future\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/347110873","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8912#issuecomment-347110873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8912","id":347110873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzExMDg3Mw==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T08:30:49Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T08:30:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Shard splitting has been implemented in #26931.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
