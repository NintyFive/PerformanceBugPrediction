We have multiple indexes each with 1 primary, 3 replicas and 5 shards. Total indices size is ~200 GB/node. \n\nWhen we start a node, it takes time to go from status yellow -> green. It recovers all the shards and sometimes the process can take upto an hour. During this time, we see that ES is creating index one by one, and _percolator is usually one of the last one(log below). \n\nIssue is - Any percolate requests hitting this node until the _percolator index is created locally(which is essentially the whole node startup recovery time) return 0 hits. Since indexing/search requests work fine on a node starting up in yellow state, percolator requests should work fine too. \n\n```\n[2013-09-16 01:52:36,245][DEBUG][indices.cluster] [mynode] [myindex_a] creating index\n[2013-09-16 01:52:40,160][DEBUG][indices.cluster] [mynode] [myindex_b] creating index\n[2013-09-16 01:52:42,353][DEBUG][indices.cluster] [mynode] [myindex_c] creating index\n.....\n.....\n[2013-09-16 02:23:17,633][DEBUG][indices.cluster] [mynode] [myindex_y] creating index\n[2013-09-16 02:25:16,477][DEBUG][indices.cluster] [mynode] [myindex_z] creating index\n[2013-09-16 02:40:16,357][DEBUG][indices.cluster] [mynode] [_percolator] creating index\n\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"ajhalani","id":1163503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1163503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajhalani","html_url":"https://github.com/ajhalani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajhalani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajhalani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajhalani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajhalani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajhalani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajhalani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajhalani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajhalani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajhalani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
