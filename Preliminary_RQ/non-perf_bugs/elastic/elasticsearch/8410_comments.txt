Tokens from different analyzers end up in the same field, which messes up term frequencies, idf, conflates tokens from different languages (eg `die` in german and english), etc.  And you can only choose a single analyzer to use at search time, so which one do you choose?  \n\nI think what you are doing already is a good approach.  If you want to do cross-language search that doesn't involve searching 42 fields, then have an additional custom `_all` field which just uses the standard analyzer (or eg the icu tokenizer plus the icu folding filter) and search that field.  That will work reasonably well.\n\nYou won't have stemming, synonyms, stopwords etc, but really you can't do that cross language in a single field anyway. \n\nI know the `_analyzer` approach sounds tempting, but you just end up with a mess of tokens and completely incorrect statistics.  \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
