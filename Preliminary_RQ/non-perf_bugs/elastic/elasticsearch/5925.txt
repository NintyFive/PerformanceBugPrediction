I have allocated 17 replicas (for a total of 18) so at least 2 of the 4 small nodes will have a copy of every shard.\n\nI have two processes querying this same index. One of them is powering a real-time user experience and is low throughput (low query rate) and low latency queries. The other process is powering something near-real-time and executes high latency queries with high throughput (high query rate).\n\nI want to target the small nodes for the low latency, low throughput queries and the large nodes for the high latency, high throughput queries. That way any performance impact from the high latency queries will not affect the real time user experience powered by low low latency queries. \n\nIs it possible to update Search Preference so that I can target the large and small nodes accordingly?  \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
