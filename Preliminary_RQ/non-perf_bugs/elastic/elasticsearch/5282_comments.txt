Can try it out without docker, just to see whether it's docker related or something else is the cause?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/36626257","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5282#issuecomment-36626257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5282","id":36626257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjI2MjU3","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-04T14:03:50Z","updated_at":"2014-03-04T14:03:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"one more thing you can try is to increase the default timeout (6s) by settings marvel.agent.exporter.es.timeout: 30s in your elasticsearch.yml (for example).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/36669981","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5282#issuecomment-36669981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5282","id":36669981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjY5OTgx","user":{"login":"damm","id":1010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damm","html_url":"https://github.com/damm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-04T20:26:50Z","updated_at":"2014-03-04T20:26:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As it's happening on 4 different servers that run the same Docker Image I'm leaning towards possibly Docker related (or something the ubuntu minimal image)\n\nI have already added `/etc/fstab` and `/etc/mtab` to collect usage.
