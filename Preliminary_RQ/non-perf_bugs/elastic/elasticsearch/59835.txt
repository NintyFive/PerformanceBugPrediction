of the common getting started problems is that a user will make a mistake while configuring their node, and it fails to start.\r\n\r\nWhen they ask for help (e.g on the forums) the advice we want to give is _you need to look at the logs and see why it's failing_, but the location of the logs is dependent on the type of install they have. The correct instructions vary based on a combination of:\r\n- Operating System\r\n- Package type (archive _vs_ OS package)\r\n- Containerization (dockers logs are different)\r\n- Process Initialization (OS service _vs_ Interactive shell)\r\n\r\nThat means that our answer ends up being something like:\r\n> you need to look at your logs, but in order to help you with that, I need to know how you installed ES and how you're running it\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to have a single place in the docs that walked the user through the process of understanding where their log files are and how to read them.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
