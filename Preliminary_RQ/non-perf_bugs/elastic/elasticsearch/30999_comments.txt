These issues received the attention of at least 3 Elasticsearch developpers who [commented](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28561#issuecomment-364040744) and [explained](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28561#issuecomment-364126503) why we were not willing to merge the change. Also, a workaround has been proposed. This is maybe not what you want, but this is the best option we can offer for now.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, the size of the change does not really matter: small or large changes can be declined. What is important here is that _we resist making changes to our codebase for OS that we do not support_. We know that from a user point of view it's hard to understand, specially when the change is a one liner. But as maintainers we know that if changes like #28562 are introduced without the right testing infrastructure it will be a pain to maintain and to not break in the future.
