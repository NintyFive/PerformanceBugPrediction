As the wikipedia page you linked to says:\n\n> The notations \"ln x\" and \"loge x\" both refer unambiguously to the natural logarithm of x. \"log x\" without an explicit base may also refer to the natural logarithm. This usage is common in mathematics and some scientific contexts as well as in many programming languages.[5] In some other contexts, however, \"log x\" can be used to denote the common (base 10) logarithm.\n\nAfter all it seemed important enough that field value factors use `ln/ln1p/ln2p` vs `log/log1p/log2p` to distinguish between them. What's worse that section appears right above the decay function documentation.\n\nI think it's reasonable to assume someone reading these docs will get mislead and assume `log` means log base 10 when the section above just defined `ln` as natural log and `log` and base 10.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
