This would be a huge gaping security hole and we definitely won't be allowing it.\n\nIn 5.0 we're releasing a new scripting language called Painless (renamed from Plan A https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/15136) which will be enabled by default.  It is fast, safe, and secure.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/196277798","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17062#issuecomment-196277798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17062","id":196277798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjI3Nzc5OA==","user":{"login":"genthalili","id":3913876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTM4NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3913876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/genthalili","html_url":"https://github.com/genthalili","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genthalili/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genthalili/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genthalili/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genthalili/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genthalili/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genthalili/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genthalili/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genthalili/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genthalili/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-14T11:56:59Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T11:56:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley thanks for the info, Painless is just the solution I am looking for, and that wears its name well!  \nMeanwhile the release of 5.0, I'll create/install my plugin which register my scripts...\nI have also noticed that when you create a Node Client (without setting `node.master` as `true`) it still installs the plugin but does not register any script, this is great for the security (unless it's a simple bug) so only the Node Master can register scripts.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
