You can also try the [experimental highlighter plugin](https://github.com/wikimedia/search-highlighter) to see if that helps.\n\nFull disclosure: I maintain the experimental highlighter plugin.  It is \"experimental\" in the sense that if is built to be easy to modify.  Maybe modular would have been a better name.  Whatever.  Despite the low version number its pretty stable and happily serves several million searches a day.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62899061","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8468#issuecomment-62899061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8468","id":62899061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODk5MDYx","user":{"login":"sschuerz","id":9714324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MTQzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9714324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sschuerz","html_url":"https://github.com/sschuerz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sschuerz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sschuerz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sschuerz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sschuerz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sschuerz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sschuerz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sschuerz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sschuerz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sschuerz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-13T14:39:40Z","updated_at":"2014-11-13T14:39:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you, @nik9000.
