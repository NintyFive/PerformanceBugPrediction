I chose to retain my local one (containing only two extra rows in the end of the file, a custom `cluster.name` and `network.host`).\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade, I tried to manually restart ES. But it refused to start, because it tried to create log files in `/usr/share/elasticsearch/`, and not `/var/log/elasticsearch/` as previously.\r\n\r\nCopying the updated `path.logs` setting from the new default `elasticsearch.yml` and starting ES again fixes the problem, but this seems lika a very intrusive change to me, and I think it's going to cause a lot of pain for users upgrading their ES nodes to 6.0.0.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Download and install ES 5.x.\r\n 2. Modify `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`\r\n 3. Download and upgrade to ES 6.0.0.\r\n 4. Choose to retain the local version of `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`\r\n 5. Restart ES, it won't start.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n[es-upgrade.log](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/1474553/es-upgrade.log)\r\n[es-startup.log](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/1474551/es-startup.log)","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
