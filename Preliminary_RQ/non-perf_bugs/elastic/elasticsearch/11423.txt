The comment at [L36](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/logging/ESLoggerFactory.java#L36) indicates that in this scenario a NoSuchMethod should be thrown and the Slf4jESLoggerFactory should be used (if slf4j is present).\n\nBut the slf4j-log4j-bridge accepts the setLevel(org.apache.log4j.Level).
