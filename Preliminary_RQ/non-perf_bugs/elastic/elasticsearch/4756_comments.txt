change stalled because of the problem of figuring out what to do when an index is boosted more than once via an alias or wildcard.  From https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/8811#issuecomment-258675219 : \n\n@masaruh just reread this thread and i think the correct answer is here:\n\n> Make indices_boost take list of index name and boost pair. We may need to do this if we want to have full control. But I somewhat hesitate to do this because it's breaking change.\n\nThen the logic would be that we use the boost from the first time we see the index in the list, so eg:\n\n```\n[  \n  { \"foo\" : 2 },  # alias foo points to bar & baz\n  { \"bar\": 1.5 }, # this boost is ignored because we've already seen bar\n  { \"*\": 1.2 }      # bar and baz are ignored because already seen, but index xyz gets this boost\n]\n```\n\nThis could be implemented in a bwc way. In fact, the old syntax doesn't need to be removed. We could just add this new syntax as an expert way of controlling boosts.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/258747770","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4756#issuecomment-258747770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4756","id":258747770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODc0Nzc3MA==","user":{"login":"masaruh","id":572174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/572174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaruh","html_url":"https://github.com/masaruh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaruh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaruh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaruh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaruh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaruh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaruh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaruh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaruh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaruh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-07T05:00:47Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T05:00:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ooh, true. that should work!
