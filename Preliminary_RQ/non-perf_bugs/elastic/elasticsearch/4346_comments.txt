If `size` wouldn't be specified, then highlighting would happen on all matches, this can make the percolate request slow if many queries match, so by making the `size` option required with highlighting, the percolate request with highlighting can't be unexpectedly slow. It just depends on the specified `size`. The documentation should have mentioned this... I'll update it. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
