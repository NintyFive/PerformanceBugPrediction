This means:\r\n\r\n- [x] Investigate if there's any special handling of the wildcard type in QL that is needed\r\n- [x] Investigate whether different type of query translation is needed in order take advantage of this field. Currently it seems that is not needed as it will happen automatically.\r\n- [x] Assess the impact it has on regular expression for EQL, in particular regarding its regex functionality.\r\n- [x] Investigate whether SQL could leverage this functionality. Since most of the functionality happens transparently and thus SQL cannot really dictate the behavior, this is mainly about setting the expectations: what type of regex functionality is supported and whether SQL can inform the user about it (since wildcard is reported as keyword, the engine has little insight).\r\n- [x] Improve testing to verify the expected behavior","closed_by":{"login":"astefan","id":893749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/893749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan","html_url":"https://github.com/astefan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
