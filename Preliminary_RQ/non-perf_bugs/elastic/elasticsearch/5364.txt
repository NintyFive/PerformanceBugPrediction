running Elasticsearch 1.0.1 using the following $ES_HOME/config/default-mapping.json:\n\n```\n{\n  \"_default_\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"foo\": {\n        \"type\": \"nested\",\n

resulting metadata is the following:\n\n```\n{\n    state: open\n    settings: {\n        index: {\n            uuid: S2hmo2d3SGWFP51PXs6XbA\n            number_of_replicas: 0\n

       }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    aliases: [ ]\n}\n```\n\nI verified that _all does include the \"elasticsearch rules\" via the following aggregation search:\n\n```\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"foobar\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"field\": \"_all\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"size\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe aggs search result is the following:\n\n```\n{\n    took: 36\n    timed_out: false\n    _shards: {\n        total: 1\n        successful: 1\n        failed: 0\n    }\n    hits: {\n        total: 1\n        max_score: 0\n        hits: [ ]\n    }\n    aggregations: {\n        foo: {\n            buckets: [\n                {\n                    key: elasticsearch\n                    doc_count: 1\n                }\n                {\n                    key: rule\n                    doc_count: 1\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo, _all should be empty, but it is not.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
