I am adding a distance script parameter to my query as follows:\n\naddScriptField(\"distance\", \"doc['latLon'].arcDistance(lat,lon)\", distanceScriptParams)\n\nThe distance field is returning a value which appears to be in meters. Based on the prior version I was running (0.90.10) and based on the documentation, this value should be in miles.\n\nIf I change my scriptField to \"arcDistanceInKm\" it returns a value equal to 1/1000 of the value I get when I run \"arcDistance\" which is what leads me to believe the value for \"arcDistance\" is being returned in meters.\n","closed_by":{"login":"chilling","id":2590333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTAzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2590333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling","html_url":"https://github.com/chilling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilling/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
