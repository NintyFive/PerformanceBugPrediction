search documentation about [merge scheduling](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-merge.html) does not explicitly state that

shard level.\r\nSpecifically, this recommendation: `If your index is on spinning platter drives instead, decrease this to 1` leads one to assume that the node disk write concurrency will be 1 which is the case only with one shard and one index on the
