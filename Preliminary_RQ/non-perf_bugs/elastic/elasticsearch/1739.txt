ES should be able to store a bounding box or polygon, then allow a search using point (is it in the indexed area), a bounding-box (does it overlap with the indexed area) or polygon.\n\nThis support would allow ES to store (for example) polygons representing states.  A client could then pass in a lat/lon representing a town, and ES would return the state that contains that town.\n","closed_by":{"login":"IanMayo","id":1108513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg1MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1108513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanMayo","html_url":"https://github.com/IanMayo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanMayo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanMayo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanMayo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanMayo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanMayo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanMayo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanMayo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanMayo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanMayo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
