For example:\n\n``` bash\nPUT /ipaddr/\n{\n  \"mappings\" : {\n    \"temp\" : {\n      \"properties\" : {\n        \"addr\" : {\n          \"type\" : \"ip\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPOST ipaddr/temp\n{\n  \"addr\" : \"127.0.011.1111111\"\n}\n```\n\nThis address is considered \"valid\", since the parser only checks for 4 dots.  If there are four dots, the, string is split and each numeric is shifted to obtain the resulting Long.
