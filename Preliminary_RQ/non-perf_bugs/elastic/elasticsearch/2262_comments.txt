See my re-creation:\nhttps://gist.github.com/4266907\n\nInside ES the match queries in both search requests get resolved to different Lucene queries. In the first request the Lucene term query is chosen, which in the case is the most efficient query to choose. In the second request the Lucene boolean query (with two should clauses) is chosen, this query is choses b/c there are two tokens in the query field.\n\nThe boost set on a term query has a different score as result than when a boost is set on a boolean query. Unfortunately setting a boost on a boolean query can't be seen in the explain as boost (boosts on a boolean query get pushed in the clauses in a normalised form).\n\nIn general what is important to remember when setting a boost on a query it doesn't mean the score needs to get x times higher then on a document that doesn't match that specified query. You're specifying that a document that matches a query is x times more important than documents that don't match that query. In your case both documents match with the match query that has query time boost of 4, so they're equal important. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/11296395","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2262#issuecomment-11296395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2262","id":11296395,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjk2Mzk1","user":{"login":"willkg","id":820826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDgyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/820826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willkg","html_url":"https://github.com/willkg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willkg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willkg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willkg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willkg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willkg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willkg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willkg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willkg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willkg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-12T16:32:13Z","updated_at":"2012-12-12T16:32:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ahhh... ok. That makes a lot more sense. It is weird and confusing that the boost doesn't show up in the explains text--makes it really difficult to trust that the explains is telling me everything that's being used to calculate the score.\n\nAnyhow, I really appreciate you walking me through this. Looks good to me--closing it out. Thanks!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
