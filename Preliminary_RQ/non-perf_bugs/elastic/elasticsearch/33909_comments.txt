In my Project we do not create Rollup Jobs via Kibana, all configuration lives in Git as JSON files and gets rolled out from there. This is the only point where I have to create a configuration in the cluster first and then issue a second request to start it, which makes it different from all other API requests. I can of course work around that easily with the `_rollup/job/<job_id>/_start` API, but IÂ´d rather issue only 1 call to ES without having this dependency on the second step.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
