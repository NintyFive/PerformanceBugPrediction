in the process of removing some mapping functionality such as the `_analyzer` field (#9279), the `_boost` field (#8875), and the type-level analyzer settings (#8874).\n\nIn all these cases, we need to:\n- inform the user that the old settings no longer works\n- allow the user to continue using their data without reindexing, even though the old settings no longer have any effect\n\nI think we should throw an exception by default, so that the user knows that there is a problem (rather than just silently changing behaviour), but we need to provide some way for the user to say \"go ahead and use this index anyway\".\n\nPossibilities:\n- apply a setting to the closed index to say \"ignore the old setting\", then allow opening the index\n- perhaps just upgrade the mapping to remove the setting if the user manually opens the index (or add a \"force\" flag to the open API?)\n- add functionality to the upgrade API to make the required mapping changes\n\nany preferences or better ideas?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
