It would require that SignificantStringTerms be subclassed to allow return of these additional fields and would need to override much of the InternalSignificantTerms base class which is designed to support String/Long subclasses which differ only in the field type of buckets.\r\n\r\nThe cost/benefits of the changes don't stack up right now.\r\n\r\nI will return to this when we start to specialise significant_text responses when we return phrases as well as terms.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
