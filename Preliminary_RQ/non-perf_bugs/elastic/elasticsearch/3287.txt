I'm currently working on a project, and a part of this includes a search engine for addresses, which I have in elasticsearch.  What I'm trying to do is use fuzzy_like_this_field queries when a new character is entered in my search bar to generate autocomplete results and try to \"guess\" which of the (~1 million) addresses the user is typing.\n\nMy issue is that I currently have a size limit on my query, as returning all of the results was both unnecessary and expensive, time-wise.  My issue, is that I often am not getting the \"correct\" result unless I return 1000 or more results from the query.  For example, if I enter \"100 broad\" in trying to search for \"100 broadway\" and I only return 200 results (about the max that I can do without it taking too long), 100 broadway is nowhere to be found, even though all of the returned results have a higher levenshtein distance than the result that I want.  I get \"100 broadway\" as the first result if I return 2000 results from my query, but it takes too long.  I can't even filter the results that got returned to bring the correct one to the top, because it's not being returned.  \n\nShouldn't putting a size limit of N on the query return the best N results, not a seemingly random subset of them?\n\nSorry if this is poorly worded or too vague.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
