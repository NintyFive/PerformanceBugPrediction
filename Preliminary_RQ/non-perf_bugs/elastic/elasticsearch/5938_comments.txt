What you are asking is more like a reindex operation, which indeed would require to reindex the documents and possibly allow to change their mappings, more like #492 or #1655.\n\nNote that this can be done by using a scan search and reindexing into a new index all of the returned documents.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/42726799","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5938#issuecomment-42726799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5938","id":42726799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzI2Nzk5","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-10T00:46:18Z","updated_at":"2014-05-10T00:46:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing since what was asked is not viable using snapshot/restore api, as expained above.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
