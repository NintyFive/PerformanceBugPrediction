However I'm getting some problems related with security manager inside my unit tests.\n\nI've picked a test case from Elasticsearch Attachments plugin to help me to find the problem. When I run the testcase 'org.elasticsearch.mapper.attachments.TikaDocTests' from original project using Gradle it works fine (no SecurityExceptions), but if I copy it \"as is\" to my Maven project and I run it I get many SecurityExceptions related with Tika (all the permissions I wrote in my plugin-security.policy are the same used by the Attachments plugin).\n\nI also noticed that no matter what I wrote in plugin-security.policy file, the tests work the same, it seems to be ignored.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**: Not applies\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\nCaused by: java.lang.SecurityException: Unable to create temporary file or directory\n    at java.nio.file.TempFileHelper.create(TempFileHelper.java:143)\n    at java.nio.file.TempFileHelper.createTempFile(TempFileHelper.java:161)\n    at java.nio.file.Files.createTempFile(Files.java:897)\n    at org.apache.tika.io.TemporaryResources.createTempFile(TemporaryResources.java:79)\n    at org.apache.tika.io.TikaInputStream.getPath(TikaInputStream.java:586)\n    at org.apache.tika.io.TikaInputStream.getFile(TikaInputStream.java:615)\n    at org.apache.tika.parser.pkg.ZipContainerDetector.detectZipFormat(ZipContainerDetector.java:143)\n    at org.apache.tika.parser.pkg.ZipContainerDetector.detect(ZipContainerDetector.java:90)\n    at org.apache.tika.detect.CompositeDetector.detect(CompositeDetector.java:77)\n    at org.apache.tika.parser.AutoDetectParser.parse(AutoDetectParser.java:112)\n    at org.apache.tika.Tika.parseToString(Tika.java:496)\n    at org.apache.tika.Tika.parseToString(Tika.java:571)\n\n<!--\nIf you are filing a feature request, please remove the above bug\nreport block and provide responses for all of the below items.\n-->\n\n**Describe the feature**: Test framework\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
