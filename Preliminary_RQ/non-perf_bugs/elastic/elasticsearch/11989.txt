The reason for failure does not seem to be the result of a bug but more a test issue. The test uses slow cluster state processing disruption to simulate cluster state processing delays when shards are deleted from a node due to relocation and this disruption sometimes seems to block more than just the needed cluster state update. \nLatest failure is here: http://build-us-00.elastic.co/job/es_core_1x_suse/958/\nI will mute this until we have a better way to test this.\n","closed_by":{"login":"brwe","id":4320215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjAyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4320215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe","html_url":"https://github.com/brwe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
