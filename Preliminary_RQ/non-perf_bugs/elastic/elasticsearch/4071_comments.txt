I list some here again. Please feel free to add your own option and vote.\n\nI vote for \n\n`PUT/POST`: Option 1\n\n`GET`: Option 2\n\n`DELETE`: Option 1\n\n## `PUT/POST`:\n\n### Option 1:\n\nRemove all singular `PUT`s, do not distinguish between `PUT` and `POST` and only allow putting multiple items for all 4 APIs like this:\n\n```\n   POST (or PUT) /index/_mappings|_settings|_warmers|_aliases\n   { name: {....}, name2: {....} ... }\n```\n\nThe `PUT` like\n\n```\n PUT /index/_alias|_warmer/{name}\n```\n\nwould be removed completely. This might cause some overhead when typing requests but at least you can remember the syntax even when you are braindead.\n\n### Option 2:\n\nMake the distinction singular/plural (`PUT/POST`) like @clintongormley wrote:\n\n```\n PUT /index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/{name}\n { ... }\n\n POST /index/_mappings|_settings|_warmers|_aliases\n { name: {....}, name2: {....} ... }\n```\n\nThis would cause the syntax to be slightly more complex but is still sort of intuitive.\n\n### Option 3:\n\nLike option 2 but allow singlar and plural for `PUT` and `POST`. Would not break bwc.\n\n## `GET`\n\n### Option 1\n\nallow plural and singular but only `GET /index/_api/{name|*|_all|blank}`\n\n```\n GET /index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer|_setting/{name|*|_all|blank}\n GET /index/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings/{name|*|_all|blank}\n```\n\n### Option 2\n\nallow only plural\n\n```\nGET /index/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings/{name|*|_all|blank}\n```\n\n### Option 3\n\nallow plural and singular with `GET /index/_api/{name|*|_all|blank}` and `GET /index/{name|*|_all|blank}/_api`\n\n```\n GET /index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer|_setting/{name|*|_all|blank}\n GET /index/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings/{name|*|_all|blank}\n\n GET /index/{name|*|_all|blank}/_mapping|_alias|_warmer|_setting\n GET /index/{name|*|_all|blank}/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings\n```\n\nWould not break bwc.\n\n### Option 4\n\nallow only plural\n\n```\nGET /index/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings/{name|*|_all|blank}\nGET /index/{name|*|_all|blank}/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings\n```\n\n## `DELETE`\n\n### Option 1\n\nMake the `DELETE` available for 3 APIs like in `_warmer`:\n\n```\n DELETE index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/name\n\n DELETE index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/prefix*\n\n DELETE index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/\n```\n\n### Option 2:\n\nLeave everything as is.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/31730378","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4071#issuecomment-31730378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4071","id":31730378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzMwMzc4","user":{"login":"brwe","id":4320215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjAyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4320215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe","html_url":"https://github.com/brwe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-07T11:29:35Z","updated_at":"2014-01-07T11:29:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After discussion here is what I will implement:\n\n`PUT/POST`: Option 2. both plural and singular version should be supported for PUT and POST but only singular for `PUT` and plural for `POST` documented.\n\nFor `PUT` `_mapping` remove \"type\" from body, because it has to be defined in url anyway and is therefore redundant.\n\n`GET`: Option 1 but also support two different orderings for `_mapping` in order to not break bwc.

When I'm posting a mapping containing a type to a URL with a non-matching I see a message acknowledging it but I don't think anything actually happened.\n\nSecond question is about deprecation. The PUT Mapping API doc mentions this:\n\n> Instead of `_mapping` you can also use the plural `_mappings`. The uri `PUT /{index}/{type}/_mapping` is still supported for backwards compatibility.  \n\nAre the singular versions supposed to be removed at some point?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
