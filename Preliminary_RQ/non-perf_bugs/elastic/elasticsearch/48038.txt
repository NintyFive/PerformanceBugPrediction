This is misleading. Elasticsearch strives to keep nodes under the `high` watermark, but it is normal to have a few nodes occasionally exceed this level. Nodes may be over the `low` watermark for an extended period without any ill effects.\r\n\r\nOn 2019-08-28 the distributed team discussed this and decided to reduce the severity of these messages. Messages about the `low` watermark should not be warnings at all, and ideally should not be emitted repeatedly since we expect nodes to be over this watermark for an extended period. Messages about the `high` watermark could reasonably be warnings iff the cluster cannot relocate shards to bring nodes under the watermark again; if the cluster is actively relocating shards that will balance the disk usage then there is no need for a warning.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
