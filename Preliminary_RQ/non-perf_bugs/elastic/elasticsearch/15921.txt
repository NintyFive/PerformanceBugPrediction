sorry in advance for the probably inaccurate terminology.\n\nWhen the `query` section of a `function_score` query would not normally rank results (e.g., a `bool` query only containing `filter` and `must_not` clauses), the function score query ranks `0` all elements regardless of the listed `functions`.\n\nMoving the filtering to an outside query works as expected.\nIn Elasticsearch 1.x, a `filtered` query only containing the `filter` section gets scored normally.\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/test/1 -d '\n{\"rank\": 1}'\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/test/2 -d '\n{\"rank\": 2}'\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/test/3 -d '\n{\"rank\": 3}'\n\n# scores everything 0\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9200/test/test/_search -d '\n{\n   \"query\": {\n      \"function_score\": {\n         \"query\": {\n            \"bool\": {\n               \"filter\": {\n                  \"range\": {\n                     \"rank\": {\n                        \"gte\": 2\n                     }\n                  }\n               }\n            }\n         },\n         \"functions\": [\n            {\n               \"field_value_factor\": {\n                  \"field\": \"rank\"\n               }\n            }\n         ]\n      }\n   }\n}'\n\n# scores appropriately\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9200/test/test/_search -d '\n{\n   \"query\": {\n      \"bool\": {\n         \"filter\": {\n            \"range\": {\n               \"rank\": {\n                  \"gte\": 2\n               }\n            }\n         },\n         \"must\": {\n            \"function_score\": {\n               \"functions\": [\n                  {\n                     \"field_value_factor\": {\n                        \"field\": \"rank\"\n                     }\n                  }\n               ]\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}'\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
