However, in Chrome if the JSON formatter plugin is enabled and it will display `1201169796353347600` in parsed result, but will display correct `1201169796353347552` in raw result. \nAlso on http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/ , if we pass `1201169796353347552` to it, it will becomes `1201169796353347600`.
