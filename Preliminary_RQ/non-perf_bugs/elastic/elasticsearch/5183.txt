Elasticsearch would re-analyze the field and twist the results appropriately for the highlighter.\n\nFurther, it'd be cool if you could set a minimum field length for which to save term vectors.  Combine this with the above and you the fvh actually gets much faster on small fields.  Not as fast as the plain highlighter or the postings highlighters, but if you are addicted to other fvh features it is nice.  Also, this allows you to hit time cpu cost for index time cpu and disk space by cranking that size up beyond where it is more efficient to re-analyze.  Again, this is really for folks addicted to the fvh.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
