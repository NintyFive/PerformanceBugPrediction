This makes it impossible to explicitly specify the non-virtual address.  Any chance this could be changed?  I had a look but couldn't find a simple way of implementing this aside from going through subInterfaces and excluding the bound addresses (I'm not too conversant in Java).  However, happy to issue a pull request if desired.\n","closed_by":{"login":"hazzadous","id":128561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODU2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/128561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazzadous","html_url":"https://github.com/hazzadous","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazzadous/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazzadous/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazzadous/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazzadous/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazzadous/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazzadous/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazzadous/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazzadous/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazzadous/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
