Expected the clean start.\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1.  Download and install rpm version elasticsearch-5.0.0-beta1.rpm\n2.  Make sure 'service elasticsearch start' command starts the elasticsearch fine. I had to modify JAVA location in /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch for it to start correctly.\n3.  Replace /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml with attached elasticsearch.yml file. In that file none of the hosts that are specified in unicast list exists \n4.  Run 'service elasticsearch stop'\n5. Run 'service elasticsearch start'\n6. Wait for a few seconds.
