In particular it was difficult to realise that `index.routing.allocation.require.data` had to be set on the index template and then also in the policy.\r\nThe doc which contains all the information is here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-allocate.html. But that is very referential... if there was an example there of how to setup a hot-warm architecture as a step-by-step, this would remove confusion.\r\nOn the other hand there are plans to formalise the concept of node tiers in ES https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60848. So perhaps if that happens soon we will be covered regardless, assuming the process becomes simpler.
