However if you start having more than one level of nesting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"foo\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"nested\",\r\n      \"include_in_root\": true,\r\n      \"include_in_parent\": true,\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"bar\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"nested\",\r\n          \"include_in_root\": true,\r\n          \"include_in_parent\": true\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `foo.bar` will copy fields to both the root and parent since parent != root. And then foo will copy fields to its parent, which is the root as well. So fields of `foo.bar` will end up twice in the root document.","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
