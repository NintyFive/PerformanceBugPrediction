upgrade of Elastic Search java library from version 0.19.4 to 0.19.9 there are random NullPointerExceptions when using System.err.\nThey are caused by code in org.elasticsearch.common.compress.snappy.xerial.XerialSnappy.\nBest way to repair this would be to patch snappy-java library and remove broken code from XerialSnappy.\nIf it's impossible then maybe at least replace System.setErr(null) to System.setErr(nullPrintStream) where nullPrintStream is an instance of PrintStream that does nothing when invoked from
