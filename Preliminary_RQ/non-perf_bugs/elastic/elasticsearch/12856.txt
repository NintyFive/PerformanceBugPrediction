With a slight decrease in performance and increase in index size, when compared its `geo_point`, counterpart this option will treat a `geo_shape` structure similar to a `geo_point` with the added benefit of being compatible with other `geo_shape` types (polygons, multipolygons, etc.).\n\nThis provides an initial solution to a question often asked in training (and most recently raised by @polyfractal), \"will geo_points be compatible with geo_shapes\". For those use cases this enhancement will allow users to separate `geo_point` fields from `geo_shape` fields, achieve a performance boost for point only queries, yet still be able to use `geo_shape` queries on both `geo_point` and `geo_shape` fields.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
