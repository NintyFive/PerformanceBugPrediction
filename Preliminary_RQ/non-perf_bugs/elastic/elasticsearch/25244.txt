This has several problems:\r\n\r\n * the user doesn't necessarily realize an API call to release resources is necessary\r\n * the node piles up open readers behind the scenes that can have a big impact on disk space and monitoring.\r\n * the node might go OOM due to too many open resources\r\n * the node might suffer from too many open files \r\n\r\nwe do protect against some of these but it would be nicer to reject scroll requests / new sticky context creation if there are too many of them. This change is rather a low hanging fruit but I suspect a big impact if a users has the related problems. A rejected scroll search would immediately be visible to the user.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
