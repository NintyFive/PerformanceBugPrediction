This means that users of RestClient must check the response entity and wrap it with a decompressor if they want to be able to handle compressed responses. \r\nSimilarly it is not possible to use compression in `reindex from remote` since the response entities are not decompressed by the rest client directly. \r\nI don't know if the RestClient should do that automatically but we should be able to use compression in `reindex` even if this means adding an explicit decompressor in reindex.
