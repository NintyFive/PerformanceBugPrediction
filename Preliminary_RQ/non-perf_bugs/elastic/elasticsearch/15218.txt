I have an ec2 linux machine in AWS that is running ElasticSearch. It is running on port 9200, and if I hit `localhost:9200` with curl I get the expected response. However, if I am outside the linux box, and try to hit the ec2 address in a browser it comes back with nothing. I have the security group on the box wide open right now so that I can hit it from the outside.\n\nI suspect that I have something configured wrong in terms of the http module. The settings I have currently (and yes they will need to be filtered down once I get this scenario working) are as follows:\n\n```\nhttp.enable: true\nhttp.cors.enable: true\nhttp.cors.allow-origin: \"*\"\n```\n\nClearly I believe I am missing something basic as it is not clear to me why this fails to work.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
