We're trying to tidy this all up with #8870, I don't want to create more redirections.\n\nReally this field-remapping is only relevant to the `query_string` and `simple_query_string` queries.  Any other queries can just use the appropriate names (or a template).  If anything, I'd suggest opening a ticket to support an allowed fields (with remapping) parameter on those two queries only.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
