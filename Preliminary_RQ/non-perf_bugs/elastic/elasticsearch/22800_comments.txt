But we are not using that actually so we can remove that support of settings on both places.\r\n\r\nWe just need to decide what are the settings which needs to stay in `elasticsearch.yml` file and at a API level.\r\n\r\nFor example, whitelisting paths or URLs is an administration ops responsability and should not be exposed to the developer so it should probably go only in the config file.\r\n\r\nNote that when using config files instead of API settings for repositories must be consistent otherwise the behavior would change from one node to another which must be avoid. Wondering if that kind of global settings should go to the cluster state so same settings could shared between nodes?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/276059369","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22800#issuecomment-276059369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22800","id":276059369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjA1OTM2OQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-30T13:14:15Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T13:14:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've opened an issue to create a centralised URL whitelist https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22860","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/328919334","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22800#issuecomment-328919334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22800","id":328919334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODkxOTMzNA==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-12T17:07:21Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T17:07:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we are all set now.
