Bug report -->\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): 6.5.4\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: []\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`): 1.8.0_192\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system): Linux x86_64\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\n`bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert` command yields an error message when you attempt to output certs to a zip file that already exists, but still returns a RC of 0.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue for scripts that may depend on the RC from running the certutil script as error detection should not depend on parsing stderr / stdout\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n* Run the `elasticsearch-certutil cert` command twice with the `--out /tmp/certs.zip` argument\r\n* The second invocation yields an ERROR message to the console\r\n* The script exists with a RC of 0 (`echo $?`) rather than non-zero (indicating failure)\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: Output file '/tmp/certs.zip' already exists\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
