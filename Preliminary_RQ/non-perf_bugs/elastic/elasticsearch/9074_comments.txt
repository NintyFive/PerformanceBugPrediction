If you change your filter from:\n\n```\n            \"term\": {\n              \"id\": 13048\n            }\n```\n\nto\n\n```\n            \"term\": {\n              \"experiments.id\": 13048\n            }\n```\n\nthen everything works correctly.  \n\nIssue #8872 will enforce the requirement to use the full path name on all fields\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
