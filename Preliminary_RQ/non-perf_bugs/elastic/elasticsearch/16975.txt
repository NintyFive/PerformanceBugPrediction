It's easy to bookmark and reuse.\n\nUnfortunately, `/_cat/indices?v` and similar endpoints have undefined order of rows and it is not always convenient. Moreover, `?v` makes using `sort(1)` less convenient, since header is sorted too.\n\nI suggest adding another parameter to sort on any column list. It would accept the same thing as `h`. Example request to sort on index time:\n\n```\ncurl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/indices?v&h=index,pri,docs,indexing.index_time&s=indexing.index_time'\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
