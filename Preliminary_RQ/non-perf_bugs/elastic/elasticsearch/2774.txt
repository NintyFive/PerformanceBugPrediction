Hence there is no need to touch the query layer for requesting suggestions.\nThis API extracts the Phrase Suggester API and makes 'suggestion request' top-level objects in suggestion requests. The complete API can be found in the\nunderlying [\"Suggest Feature API\"](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/suggest.html).\n# API Example\n\nThe following examples show how Suggest Actions work on the REST layer. According to this a simple request and its response will be shown.\n## Suggestion Request\n\n``` json\ncurl -s -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_suggest -d {\n    \"text\" : \"Xor the Got-Jewel\",\n    \"simple_phrase\" : {\n        \"phrase\" : {\n            \"analyzer\" : \"bigram\",\n            \"field\" : \"bigram\",\n            \"size\" : 1,\n            \"real_word_error_likelihood\" : 0.95,\n            \"max_errors\" : 0.5,\n            \"gram_size\" : 2\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis example shows how to query a suggestion for the global text 'Xor the Got-Jewel'. A 'simple phrase' suggestion is requested and\na 'direct generator' is configured to generate the candidates.\n## Suggestion Response\n\nOn success the request above will reply with a response like the following:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"simple_phrase\" : [ {\n        \"text\" : \"Xor the Got-Jewel\",\n        \"offset\" : 0,\n        \"length\" : 17,\n        \"options\" : [ {\n            \"text\" : \"xorr the the got got jewel\",\n            \"score\" : 3.5283546E-4\n        } ]\n    } ]\n}\n```\n\nThe 'suggest'-response contains a single 'simple phrase' which contains an 'option' in turn. This option represents a suggestion of the\nqueried text. It contains the corrected text and a score indicating the probability of this option to be meant.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
