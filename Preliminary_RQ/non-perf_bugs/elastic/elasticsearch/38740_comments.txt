I think I have found the issue.\r\n\r\n> The security code uses `doc` for its type. If your `.security` index has `_doc`, then something strange has happened.\r\n\r\nThe mapping with type `_doc` gets created when using the Upgrade Assistant in 8.0 to reindex 7.x indices in preparation for 9.0. Because the Upgrade Assistant uses the typeless API in 7.0+ (which I believe is the only way to create new indices), I'm guessing Elasticsearch creates a mapping with `_doc` under the hood. Seems to me the internal mappings for `.security` need to be updated to use `_doc` or no type at all.\r\n\r\nThe only change needed in your steps to reproduce the issue would be between steps (9) and (10). Before Step 10:\r\n- Startup Kibana 8.0 against ES 8.0\r\n- Start the reindex. Currently this has to be done via API b/c the Elasticsearch Deprecations API does not mark any indices in 8.0 as need to be reindexed for the next Lucene version, so the UI does not show them.\r\n  - `curl -u elastic:changeme -XPOST localhost:5601/api/upgrade_assistant/reindex/.security-6 -H 'kbn-xsrf: true'`\r\n- Wait for the reindex to complete. You'll need to wait until the `reindexOp.status` field of this response is equal to `1`:\r\n  - `curl -u elastic:changeme -XGET localhost:5601/api/upgrade_assistant/reindex/.security-6`\r\n- Look at the new mappings for `.security`, verify you see `_doc` now instead of `doc`.\r\n  - `curl \"localhost:9200/.security/_mappings?include_type_name=true\" -u elastic:changeme`","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/463045779","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38740#issuecomment-463045779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38740","id":463045779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzA0NTc3OQ==","user":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-13T03:46:08Z","updated_at":"2019-02-13T03:46:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joshdover \r\nThanks for your investigation.
