[...] However, this actually results in the field being mapped as a float.\r\n\r\nThe documentation is wrong indeed. I'll fix.\r\n\r\n> Therefore, based on the absence of the float datatype in that list and the fact that the floating point numbers are being dynamically mapped with a float datatype, it would seem that dynamically mapped floating point numbers cannot be mapped to a double datatype using match_mapping_type.\r\n\r\nThat part probably needs clarification though I'm not sure how to do it. Basically, the json parser assumes the wider datatype that is not a BigDecimal/BigInteger. So floating-point numbers will be detected as a `double` rather than a `float` and integers will be detected as a `long` rather than an `integer`. You can dynamically map floating-point numbers to doubles by using `double` as a `match_mapping_type` and `double` as a type in the mapping.\r\n\r\n> *DISCLAIMER The following is a shameless plug for 64-bit Unsigned Integer support in Elasticsearch\r\nThe dynamic mapping to double is needed as there is no support for 64-bit unsigned integers in Elasticsearch, whereas the system publishing the data (a custom Elastic Beat written in Go) does support 64-bit unsigned integers.\r\n\r\nThis feature has been asked already at #30939, but it has taken some time because most of the needs that were expressed initially couldn't be supported, such as aggregating big decimals. However there seems to be a number of people who seem interested in uint64 support and accept the fact that aggregations would work by dynamically converting them to doubles, which might incur some accuracy loss.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
