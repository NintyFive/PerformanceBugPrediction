I'll label this with \"feedback needed\" because it would be great to hear if you can work with that. If thats the case also please feel free to close this issue, otherwise maybe you can come back with more information whats missing.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/326572453","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26469#issuecomment-326572453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26469","id":326572453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjU3MjQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"nomoa","id":5939211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzkyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5939211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nomoa","html_url":"https://github.com/nomoa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nomoa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nomoa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nomoa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nomoa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nomoa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nomoa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nomoa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nomoa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nomoa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-01T12:53:30Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T12:53:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cbuescher yes this exactly what I need, sorry for the noise I was looking at the 5.x code base.\r\nThanks!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
