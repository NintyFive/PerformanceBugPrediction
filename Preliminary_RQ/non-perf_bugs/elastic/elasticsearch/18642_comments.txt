ES's DSL is far richer than SQL or SQL plus a few more commands. But then again, exposing SQL-like queries probably would drive adoption quite a bit and those non-ES users that adopt it probably would get more comfortable with the ES DSL if they had a SQL-like bridge to help them start using it. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/223518587","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18642#issuecomment-223518587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18642","id":223518587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzUxODU4Nw==","user":{"login":"yehosef","id":149253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTI1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/149253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef","html_url":"https://github.com/yehosef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehosef/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T08:16:15Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T08:16:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It's also valuable for tooling that supports sql like tableau - and it makes it easier for things like apache Drill to use elasticsearch in that stack.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/223605377","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18642#issuecomment-223605377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18642","id":223605377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzYwNTM3Nw==","user":{"login":"ajaybhatnagar","id":8180763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODA3NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8180763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhatnagar","html_url":"https://github.com/ajaybhatnagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhatnagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhatnagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhatnagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhatnagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhatnagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhatnagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhatnagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhatnagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajaybhatnagar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T15:08:40Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T15:08:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It will be good to have sql like interface as it helps migrating/adopting from RDBMS setups with lower training/adoptions needs of the organizations.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/398056484","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18642#issuecomment-398056484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18642","id":398056484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODA1NjQ4NA==","user":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-18T13:37:18Z","updated_at":"2018-06-18T13:37:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Elasticsearch SQL has been officially released in 6.3:\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack/elasticsearch-sql","performed_via_github_app":null}]
