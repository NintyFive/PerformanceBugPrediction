https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9359 we discussed the possibility of extending the `action.auto_create_index` setting to automatically recognise index names which match templates, and to allow those to be auto-created without having to maintain both the template and the setting.\n\nIn FixitFriday we came up with a better solution:\n- Remove the `action.auto_create_index` setting\n- Add an `auto_create_index` setting to index templates - if true, then an index can be auto-created\n- Ship with a default match `*` index with `auto_create_index: true` - this can be overridden by the user\n- If multiple templates match, the `auto_create_index` setting is merged just like all other template settings - the highest `order` wins\n\nWhen upgrading, the user will see an exception if they set `action.auto_create_index` and will need to update their templates to reflect the same logic.\n\nPossibly, we could add a deprecation period where the `action.auto_create_index` setting continues to work, but also accepts a `_template` value which switches to use the template-based logic instead.\n","closed_by":{"login":"pugnascotia","id":8696382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTYzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8696382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia","html_url":"https://github.com/pugnascotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
