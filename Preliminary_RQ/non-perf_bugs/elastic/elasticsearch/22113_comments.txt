Note that ES 5.1.0 is a version that should have never been released (some artifacts were prematurely published though so your system might have picked up those) and 5.1.1 does not have BWC for it. The easiest fix here is to upgrade to 5.1.1 and do a full-cluster restart.\r\n\r\n/cc: @clintongormley \r\n\r\nRelates to

mistake in the comment (now edited) , you are right it ... i had an \"half cluster\" with on 5.0.x and one 5.1.0 (which was the master) when i got my first 5.1.1 and so it must have failed for the same reason is failing now.\r\n\r\nI know that was not supposed to be available, but i mirror the repo and so the mirroring must have run when it was available. \r\n\r\nI had 3 nodes at 5.0.1 , one died and i redeployed with latest at that moment, which was 5.1.0 \r\n\r\nThen tried to upgrade my other nodes to latest , which was 5.1.1 , The master at that point was 5.1.0 and all broke.\r\n\r\nI will try to stop the cluster and do a full upgrade and start, this is just a test one
