The system has to do the work regardless (and if you don't have enough FS cache it might have to do the work twice).

The longer it takes to read the shard info, the longer the cluster stays red. In a large cluster, it takes quite a while. The goal of this endpoint is to reduce downtime of a cluster in case of restart/failover/upgrade. It is realized by warming the filesystem caches before shutting down the cluster so that reading the shard info upon restart goes faster.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/172629650","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11229#issuecomment-172629650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11229","id":172629650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjYyOTY1MA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-18T19:30:52Z","updated_at":"2016-01-18T19:30:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ywelsch do you still think we need to do something here?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
