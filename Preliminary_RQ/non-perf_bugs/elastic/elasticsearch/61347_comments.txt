If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. The discussion forums are better suited to these sorts of troubleshooting and problem diagnosis conversations.\r\n\r\nFrom your description, it looks like you have 1 of either these situations:\r\n1. You are not retaining the full `data` directory correctly between node restarts\r\n2. This is a temporary message during startup while the cluster recovers from disk and there's nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the forums that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
