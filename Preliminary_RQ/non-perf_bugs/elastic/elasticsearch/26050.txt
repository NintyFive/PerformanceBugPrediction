The maintainer of the package has to do a little more work and has to document the upgraded config file better, but then ucf will help doing a three-way merge of the previous default file, the new config file and the customized one.\r\n\r\nI'm no expert in this tol, but its usage is encouraged by the Debian team and it would change the upgrade process for the better with automatic resolution of most \"conflicts\".\r\n\r\n<!-- Bug report -->\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): all\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: N/A\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`): N/A\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system): Debian/Ubuntu","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
