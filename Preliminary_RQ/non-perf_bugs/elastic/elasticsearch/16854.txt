That way we know when we break scripts or the deb or rpm or something. I'm going to use this ticket to track effort:\n- [x] Get the tests passing again. We need to do this to make sure we don't break anything in the next step. #17152 \n- [x] Switch the boxes to those that Elastic has on Vagrant Atlas ([here](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/elastic)). We need to do this because those are easier to host in Elastic's CI - mostly because they have lxc versions which can be spun up in AWS. #17195 \n- [x] Add sles-11 checks. Elastic added a sles-11 box to vagrant atlas. We should use it! \n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
