If you update the collapse key in your documents there is a possibility that the first search and the `inner_hits` do not apply to the same documents. You can mitigate this behavior by adding a [search preference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-preference.html) to your request. This will ensure that the additional request is executed on the same set of replicas that the main search. There's still a chance that searchers on the same replicas gets updated between the two requests but there's nothing that can prevent this at the moment.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
