The workaround is to use the full name for the field as you already did (`_parent#[parent_type]`). At this point and considering that the `_parent` field will soon disappear (in favor of the `join` field) I am not sure it is worth fixing. We chatted with @martijnvg and said that we can instead document the new syntax and add the breaking change in the release notes.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/372743966","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26571#issuecomment-372743966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26571","id":372743966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjc0Mzk2Ng==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T17:10:52Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T17:10:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @elastic/es-search-aggs ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/480790163","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26571#issuecomment-480790163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26571","id":480790163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDc5MDE2Mw==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T11:17:29Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T11:17:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The `_parent` field has been removed in 7.0, hence closing","performed_via_github_app":null}]
