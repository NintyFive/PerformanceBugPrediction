The search always returns no buckets in the aggregation when a geo_bouding_box filter is applied to attempt to scope the query to documents in a bounding box.\n\nI have a `properties` index that have `property` documents with children `listing` documents. Listings have a `broker` attribute. I need to find distinct `broker` attributes and the number of their occurrences for \nall properties in a bounding box.\n\nThe query I am performing is as follows:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"filtered\": {\n            \"query\": { \"match_all\": {} },\n            \"filter\": {\n                \"geo_bounding_box\" : {\n                    \"location\" : {\n                        \"top_left\" : {\n                            \"lat\" : 40.73,\n                            \"lon\" : -74.1\n                        },\n                        \"bottom_right\" : {\n                            \"lat\" : 40.01,\n                            \"lon\" : -71.12\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"aggs\" : {\n        \"brokers\" : {\n            \"terms\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"listing.broker\",\n                \"order\" : { \"_term\" : \"asc\" }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe result I get back is the following:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"took\": 6,\n  \"timed_out\": false,\n  \"_shards\": {\n    \"total\": 5,\n    \"successful\": 5,\n    \"failed\": 0\n  },\n  \"hits\": {\n    \"total\": 2179,\n    \"max_score\": 0,\n    \"hits\": []\n  },\n  \"aggregations\": {\n    \"brokers\": {\n      \"doc_count_error_upper_bound\": 0,\n      \"sum_other_doc_count\": 0,\n      \"buckets\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe mapping of the index is as follows:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"aliases\": {},\n    \"mappings\": {\n      \"property\": {\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"address\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          },\n          \"city\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          },\n          \"country\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          },\n          \"location\": {\n            \"type\": \"geo_point\"\n          },\n          \"id\": {\n            \"type\": \"long\"\n          },\n          \"state\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          },\n          \"street\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          },\n          \"title\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          },\n          \"zip_code\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"listing\": {\n        \"_parent\": {\n          \"type\": \"property\"\n        },\n        \"_routing\": {\n          \"required\": true\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"broker\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Replacing the `geo_bounding_box` with other filter types like a `term` filter works as expected\n- I am expecting back buckets with the value of the broker attribute on a listing with the document count within the bounding box\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
