For example:\n- You can add `\"store\":false` to the key2 mapping to not store it in the index\n- You can add `\"include_in_all\":false` to the key2 mapping to make it not included in the `_all` field (which means it won't be included in a text search unless you search explicitly on the key2 field)\n- You can set `\"index\":\"no\"` to the key2 mapping to make it not searchable at all\n\nFYI, we have a [great discussion forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) where questions like these can be asked!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/139572698","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13516#issuecomment-139572698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13516","id":139572698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTU3MjY5OA==","user":{"login":"abtpst","id":4314840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ4NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4314840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abtpst","html_url":"https://github.com/abtpst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abtpst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abtpst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abtpst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abtpst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abtpst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abtpst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abtpst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abtpst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abtpst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-11T15:17:01Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T15:17:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks, i tried to include everything like\n\"key2\":{\n                     \"type\" : \"object\",\n                      \"enabled\" : false,\n                       \"store\":false,\n                       \"include_in_all\":false,\n                       \"index\":\"no\"\n}\n\nbut still, when i try to ingest the data,, it is not ignored. i will post the question on the forum as well.\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/139684784","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13516#issuecomment-139684784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13516","id":139684784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTY4NDc4NA==","user":{"login":"eskibars","id":2246002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDYwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2246002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars","html_url":"https://github.com/eskibars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-11T23:18:00Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T23:18:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Discussion continued [here](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-search-how-to-ignore-a-field-in-mapping/29145/2) for anybody that wants to track this.
