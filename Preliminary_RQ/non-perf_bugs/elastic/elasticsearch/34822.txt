E.g., when a user types in xyz they see a list of domains with xyz in it, this can be xyz.com, helloxyz.com, xyzworld.com, etc. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, if the user inputs something with a period, our query will work _for the most part_, E.g., if the user input xyz1 elasticsearch will return xyz1.com, however, if the user input xyz1.com elasticsearch will NOT return xyz1.com. \r\n\r\nSo at first, we were led to believe that the wildcard query cannot support periods, however, upon further testing, we saw that was not the case. E.g., when a user types in xyz.com, we will get all domains with xyz.com like helloxyz.com and worldxyz.com. \r\n\r\nWe think **elasticsearch has an issue with looking up a number followed up an escaped character**.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we can't input dashes and find values with dashes in them, e.g., if we input xyz-goodbye we will not get xyz-domain.com.\r\n\r\n**So there is also the issue of characters like dashes.**\r\n\r\nWe are using bodybuilder.js and our query is:\r\n\r\n`.query('wildcard', 'url', '*'+text+'*')`\r\n\r\n_`.query('wildcard', 'url', '*xyz1.*')` will not return xyz1.com_ \r\n\r\nAny help is highly appreciated, thank you.","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
