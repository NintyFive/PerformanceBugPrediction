They were large-ish so I set the refresh_interval to `-1` during the load process and to `1s` after it was finished. I also sent a `_flush` to the index after all the documents were loaded so I could send a `_count` and get accurate numbers.\n\nAnyway, after that I tried to stop Elasticsearch so that I could shut it down and make a copy of the load for posterity. I hit `ctrl-c` in its window. It didn't die. I worked for an hour and came back. Still not dead. The only runnable threads are ConcurrentMergeScheduler [doing its thing](https://gist.github.com/nik9000/3dc4df2b97ced8c7d60b). It also had three threads that looked [parked](https://gist.github.com/nik9000/96d3ddc5408fbbda03fd) but in the middle of something.\n\nThese wait times seem to be a bit much. I get waiting for a minute to try to finish a merge but an hour is going to have people `kill -9`ing Elasticsearch pretty consistently.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
