You have a number of issues, eg \n- you have `fitler` instead of `filter` in your `lowercase_search` definition.  \n- using a `keyword` tokenizer at search time for fields that are tokenized with the `standard` tokenizer will almost never work.\n- your `doc_values` will store the original value of the field, not tokenized and not case-folded\n\nCould you put together a small recreation of what it is you're seeing?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68453788","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8616#issuecomment-68453788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8616","id":68453788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NDUzNzg4","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-31T16:52:56Z","updated_at":"2014-12-31T16:52:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No more info provided.
