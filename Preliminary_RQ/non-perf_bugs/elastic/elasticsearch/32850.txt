To support this effort, we want to make some changes to the logs in Elasticsearch including removing some existing pain points. The main highlight of these changes will be shipping with JSON logging.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change the name of the main log file to something like `server.log`. Today the main log file is `<clustername>.log` and this creates complexity for Filebeat; it would be simpler for them if they could rely on an include pattern based on a predictable log file name (another possibility here is `server-<clustername>.log`). Note that this will be a breaking change.\r\n- [ ] Each log line should contain the node ID and cluster ID (machine friendly, and serve as unique identifiers), and node name and cluster name (human friendly). Filebeat wants to see these for instances where logs are being collected to a single sink from multiple nodes and multiple clusters.\r\n- [ ] Improve logging in the official Docker images. Logging in Docker images traditionally goes to standard output and standard error. We do this with our official Docker images today, but then there is no way to distinguish the server logs from the audit, deprecation, and slow logs. With a single output stream, we need to add a \"type\" field to the log outputs from the Docker container so the different sources can be parsed from the single standard output stream.\r\n- [ ] Enable JSON layout. Today we do not support layout, mainly due to security manager issues. We need to address these. With this effort, we want the logs to remain human friendly, so we will also want to define an ordering of the first few fields in the JSON object (something like `timestamp`, `log_level`, `component`, `node_name`, `index_name`, `shard_id`, `message`).","closed_by":{"login":"pgomulka","id":11137008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTM3MDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11137008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka","html_url":"https://github.com/pgomulka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
