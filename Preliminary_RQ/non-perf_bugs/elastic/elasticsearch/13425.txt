There are a few issues:\n1. We don't have a release of 2.x so the best we can do to test 2.x is to use 2.0.0-beta1. But `Version#minimumCompatibilityVersion` seems to reject that. Its simple enough to just make it accept the beta for now.\n2. `CompositeTestCluster` seems to be a bit broken.\n3. The backwards section in TESTING.asciidoc is super out of date.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
