I think adding a new cluster privilege, `monitor_snapshot`, in addition to the sole `create_snapshot` one, is a nice improvement and I am willing to review your work and get it merged in. I can't think of any reason other maintainers would reject it, IMO a privilege to only read snapshot and repositories info and statuses, without being able to create or delete snapshots or repositories, is consistent with how authorization is currently structured.\r\n\r\nAs an implementation hint, you can checkout the `CREATE_SNAPSHOT_PATTERN` in the `ClusterPrivilegeResolver` class and create a new pattern and the associated privilege for the `SnapshotsStatusAction.NAME + \"*\"`, `GetSnapshotsAction.NAME`, `SnapshotsStatusAction.NAME` and `GetRepositoriesAction.NAME` actions. I expect you'll have to dig around a little bit to write the tests, the code in that area is a bit dated, but we're always glad to help.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/568801792","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50210#issuecomment-568801792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50210","id":568801792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODgwMTc5Mg==","user":{"login":"amirhmd","id":17741539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzQxNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17741539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amirhmd","html_url":"https://github.com/amirhmd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amirhmd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amirhmd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amirhmd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amirhmd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amirhmd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amirhmd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amirhmd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amirhmd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amirhmd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-24T21:00:31Z","updated_at":"2019-12-24T21:00:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi @albertzaharovits \r\nit looks like @j-bean already created a pull request.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/569519684","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50210#issuecomment-569519684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50210","id":569519684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTUxOTY4NA==","user":{"login":"albertzaharovits","id":4568420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njg0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4568420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits","html_url":"https://github.com/albertzaharovits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-29T16:16:22Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T16:16:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @amirhmd .
