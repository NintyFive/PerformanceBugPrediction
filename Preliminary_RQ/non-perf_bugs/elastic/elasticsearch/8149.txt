This becomes an issue when there are a lot of updates where the documents are loaded onto the primary shards first.    The http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-update-settings.html#_balanced_shards weight settings do not always help and require re-tuning when new nodes or new shards are added.  It will be nice to provide a setting similar to http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-allocation.html#_total_shards_per_node , but only applies to primary shards, like total_primary_shards_per_node which allows the end user to define the maximum # of primary shards an index can have on a single node.  This will ensure that multiple primary shards are not allocated to the same node.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
