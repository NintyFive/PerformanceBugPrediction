You don't lose any data by removing an alias, but you might cause problems to applications and users relying on aliases. The thing is that the request does contain the explicit name of the alias that you want to delete; imagine you are performing a destructive operation on that same alias, like a delete foo, that is going to work fine since you didn't have wildcards in your request. I think that the current behaviour is ok, but we can open this up for discussion and see what other folks think.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/161750650","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9082#issuecomment-161750650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9082","id":161750650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTc1MDY1MA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-03T19:11:40Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T19:11:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No more comments on this issue, so guessing this isn't widely needed.
