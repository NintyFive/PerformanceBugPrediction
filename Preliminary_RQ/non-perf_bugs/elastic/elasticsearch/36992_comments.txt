The versions of deleted documents will be maintained for at least the `index.gc_deletes`  time interval. You can disable `gc_deletes` by setting `index.gc_deletes` to `-1`.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to direct these kinds of things to the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/). If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. There's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/450158139","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36992#issuecomment-450158139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36992","id":450158139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDE1ODEzOQ==","user":{"login":"joemantk","id":46164772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MTY0Nzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/46164772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemantk","html_url":"https://github.com/joemantk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemantk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemantk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemantk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemantk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemantk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemantk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemantk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemantk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemantk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-27T14:14:59Z","updated_at":"2018-12-27T14:14:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for the replay\r\nI do not think I will be able to change the index.gc_deletes value because sometimes it is not my ES cluster, sometimes I'm just hosted there\r\nMy main question was why refresh \r\nas state in https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-refresh.html\r\ndoes not work as it is describe in the documentation \r\nI will use the forum to find an answer\r\nThanks,","performed_via_github_app":null}]
