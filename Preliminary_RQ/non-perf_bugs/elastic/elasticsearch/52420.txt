They cannot be normal indices from 8.0 onwards.\r\n\r\nSince the hidden index functionality is available we should start to use it now.  The following patterns of `.ml` index should become hidden indices, i.e. have the `index.hidden` setting added to them on creation:\r\n\r\n1. `.ml-anomalies*`\r\n2. `.ml-state*`\r\n3. `.ml-notifications*`\r\n4. `.ml-annotations*`\r\n5. `.ml-stats*`\r\n\r\n(Note `.ml-config*` and `.ml-meta*` will become system indices and should not be altered by this piece of work.  Any others I have missed need discussing.)","closed_by":{"login":"przemekwitek","id":19312454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzEyNDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19312454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek","html_url":"https://github.com/przemekwitek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
