The below works fine for me:\n\n```\nPUT _template/test\n{\n  \"template\": \"logstash-*\",\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"_default_\": {\n      \"_ttl\": {\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"default\": \"5s\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT /logstash-one/test/1\n{}\n\nGET logstash-one/_mapping\n```\n\nBtw, using TTL for logging is likely a very bad approach, as older documents need to be physically deleted.  Much better to just drop old indices.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/96428597","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10055#issuecomment-96428597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10055","id":96428597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2NDI4NTk3","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-26T19:57:24Z","updated_at":"2015-04-26T19:57:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No more info.
