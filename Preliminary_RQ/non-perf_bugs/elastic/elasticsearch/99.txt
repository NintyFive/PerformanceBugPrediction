What seems to be happening is:\n\nMy process:\n- i'm reindexing old_index to new_index\n- i read 5000 docs from the old index, then create each one in the new index\n- if there is an error, then i delete new_index\n\nSo:\n- the cluster gets busy, and a search for the next 5,000 docs results in this error: `select failed: No child processes`.  \n- This was triggering the cleanup in my script which deleted the index.  \n- It appears the index has been deleted by one node, while another node is still trying to write snapshot info for the (now deleted) index, which results in these errors:\n  \n  [14:48:09,948][WARN ][index.gateway            ] [Nameless One][ia_object_1270046679][0] Failed to snapshot on close\n  org.elasticsearch.index.gateway.IndexShardGatewaySnapshotFailedException: [ia_object_1270046679][0] Failed to append snapshot translog into [/opt/elasticsearch/data/iAnnounce/ia_object_1270046679/0/translog/translog-3]\n      at org.elasticsearch.index.gateway.fs.FsIndexShardGateway.snapshot(FsIndexShardGateway.java:199)\n      at org.elasticsearch.index.gateway.IndexShardGatewayService$1.snapshot(IndexShardGatewayService.java:154)\n      at org.elasticsearch.index.engine.robin.RobinEngine.snapshot(RobinEngine.java:350)\n      at org.elasticsearch.index.shard.service.InternalIndexShard.snapshot(InternalIndexShard.java:369)\n      at org.elasticsearch.index.gateway.IndexShardGatewayService.snapshot(IndexShardGatewayService.java:150)\n      at org.elasticsearch.index.gateway.IndexShardGatewayService.close(IndexShardGatewayService.java:176)\n      at org.elasticsearch.index.service.InternalIndexService.deleteShard(InternalIndexService.java:244)\n      at org.elasticsearch.index.service.InternalIndexService.close(InternalIndexService.java:159)\n      at org.elasticsearch.indices.InternalIndicesService.deleteIndex(InternalIndicesService.java:208)\n      at org.elasticsearch.indices.InternalIndicesService.deleteIndex(InternalIndicesService.java:185)\n      at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n      at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)\n      at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\n      at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)\n      at com.google.inject.internal.ConstructionContext$DelegatingInvocationHandler.invoke(ConstructionContext.java:108)\n      at $Proxy19.deleteIndex(Unknown Source)\n      at org.elasticsearch.indices.cluster.IndicesClusterStateService.clusterChanged(IndicesClusterStateService.java:178)\n      at org.elasticsearch.cluster.service.InternalClusterService$2.run(InternalClusterService.java:193)\n      at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.runTask(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:886)\n      at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:908)\n      at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)\n  Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /opt/elasticsearch/data/iAnnounce/ia_object_1270046679/0/translog/translog-3 (Stale NFS file handle)\n      at java.io.RandomAccessFile.open(Native Method)\n      at java.io.RandomAccessFile.<init>(RandomAccessFile.java:212)\n      at org.elasticsearch.index.gateway.fs.FsIndexShardGateway.snapshot(FsIndexShardGateway.java:184)\n      ... 20 more\n\nNow, I'm catching the `select failed: No child processes` errors, sleeping for a few seconds, then trying again, and everything is working well.\n\nta\n\nclint\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
