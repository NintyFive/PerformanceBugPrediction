The XContentBuilder\nAPI would have to be extended. Unfortunately the format of ES\nrequests/responses is currently not available for being extended by a third\nparty plugin, so a change in the core code would be required.\n\n2) The documentation of Elasticsearch objects is here\nhttp://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/object-type/\n\nI learned the restriction from this report\nhttps://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/2354\n\nElasticsearch objects are a JSON object in braces, and the purpose is to\nconstruct path specifications for Lucene index field names for the values\nin the object. Values can be repeated in a Lucene field, and JSON arrays\ncan be used for denoting that.\n\n3) \"Disabling the parsing\" refers to the Elasticsearch object model of the\nJSON document only. If the Elasticsearch object model is not valid in the\ninput, the ES parser rejects the JSON document.\n\nOn Tue, Aug 13, 2013 at 6:33 PM, Kevin Ford notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Thanks, Jörg, for commenting.\n> \n> A few quick questions:\n> \n> 1) Could my issue be considered a feature request or is this a necessary\n> design limitation?\n> 2) Is what you describe documented anywhere?\n> 3) The documentation for an object mapping says that \"The enabled flag\n> allows to _disable parsing_ and adding a named object completely.\"\n> Emphasis mine.

The problem is with indexing it, in ES, we require the contents of arrays to be the same json type (object, value) because of how it ends up being translated to indexing it into Lucene.\n\nIf you think about it, it is quite strange to index a value and an object within an array, not very evident into how to be able to search it. We could potentially allow it to be indexed fully, and then just accept the fact that its ambiguous when searching, but requires a bit of thinking.\n\nObviously, if you don't care about how its being index, you can simply use mapping and disable parts of the json from being indexed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/22630452","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3497#issuecomment-22630452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3497","id":22630452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjMwNDUy","user":{"login":"jprante","id":635745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTc0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/635745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante","html_url":"https://github.com/jprante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-14T11:57:27Z","updated_at":"2013-08-14T11:59:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"JSONML has some characteristics in the JSON array, the first element denotes an XML element tag.
