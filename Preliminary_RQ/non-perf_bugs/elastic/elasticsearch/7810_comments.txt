HTTP. The user didn't sign up for that action, some script is making that call. DENIED\" \n\nThis is all quite reasonable, the only thing you'd be protecting is Kibana's static assets that anyone can freely clone from github. The valuable data would be transmitted insecurely, fortunately the browser has your back on that one.\n\nIf you want more information on the how and why, Mozilla has a nice blog post about Firefox's mixed content blocker here: https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2013/04/10/mixed-content-blocking-enabled-in-firefox-23/. All major browsers block mixed content.\n\nYou can avoid this by setting up a proxy to securely transport XHR requests from the browser, to your webserver and then transmit them unencrypted to Elasticsearch over your, presumably segmented, private network. See some example in the kibana repo here: https://github.com/elasticsearch/kibana/tree/master/sample\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
