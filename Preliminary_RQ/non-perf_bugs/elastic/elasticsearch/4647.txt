For instance, a machine with 12 processors and 4GB of heap would use 410MB of memory for the recycler but each thread would only have 11MB (given that the default size of the search thread pool is 3 \\* ${processors}).\n\nMoreover, I don't think there is a lot of contention on this recycler since it is only used for large objects.\n\nI think it would be a better trade-off to use the queue recycler by default (which is based on a non-blocking queue)? Or maybe something in-between that would allow for sharing data between several threads (with a configurable concurrency level like ConcurrentHashMap)?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
