We should discuss whether it makes sense to remove it given that one can simply use the `_search` api instead and set `size` to `0`.\n\nWhen it comes to the REST layer, the lines of code required to maintain the shortcut to search are not many, but the java api requires a bit more, it would be nice to get rid of that and simplify things.\n\nI see a few disadvantages on the client side:\n- it's handy to have the _count endpoint for ease of use, although it is super easy to move to `_search?size=0`\n- if you forget to set the `size` to `0` everything works, but more work is done under the hood\n- last I can think of is the different response:\n\n```\n{\n    \"count\" : 1,\n    \"_shards\" : {\n        \"total\" : 5,\n        \"successful\" : 5,\n        \"failed\" : 0\n    }\n}\n```\n\ncompared to the search api response which is a bit more convoluted:\n\n```\n{\n    \"_shards\":{\n        \"total\" : 5,\n        \"successful\" : 5,\n        \"failed\" : 0\n    },\n    \"hits\":{\n        \"total\" : 1\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
