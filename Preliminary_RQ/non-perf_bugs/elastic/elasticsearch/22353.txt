We weren't able to find an answer to this in our product manual, the closest we could find was this one:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_finding_exact_values.html#_internal_filter_operation\r\n\r\n\"Although not quite true in reality (execution is a bit more complicated based on how the query planner re-arranges things, and some heuristics based on query cost), you can conceptually think of non-scoring queries as executing before the scoring queries. The job of non-scoring queries is to reduce the number of documents that the more costly scoring queries need to evaluate, resulting in a faster search request.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe we can add some details to the bool query page?","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
