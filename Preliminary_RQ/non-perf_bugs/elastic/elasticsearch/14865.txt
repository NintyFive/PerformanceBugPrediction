from user:\n\"...a lot of our product revolves around Elasticsearch. we find a lot of our customers have a really hard time understanding the Elasticsearch documentation about the query DSL, because the segments described don't provide context on where they seem to fit in. ie:\n                      https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-range-query.html It shows you a helpful segment, but doesn't provide an easy way to jump from there to \"ok how do I use this in an actual query\"\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
