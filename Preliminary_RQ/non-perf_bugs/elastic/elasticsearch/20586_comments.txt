Bloom filter are notorious for \"saturating\" if they are undersized, so that's a valid concern.\n\nI was imagining that bloom sizing would be configurable (ala `precision_threshold` for cardinality), so the user could adjust to their liking.  E.g. try several settings to see what made the most sense regarding their hardware / accuracy requirements.  \n\nIf we could auto-size on string fields that'd be great.

It might lead to significantly oversizing the bloom filter though since not all values in the range might be used. If we decide to make it a different aggregation, we could just decide that it only works on keyword fields (similarly to the fact that the stats agg only works on numeric fields).\n\n> Re: count-min, I think that may be tricky since count-min approximates poorly for the \"long-tail\" of a distribution, which is where these frequencies would be useful.\n\nAgreed.
