For the first we need to check to make sure the stored/file script is the same as the one in the cached request, I don't know who the responsibility should belong to for invalidation, but I guess it would be a callback to a listener coming out of the ScriptService every time a new stored/file script is cached.  For the second one, I need to go through the whitelist for Painless and make sure that it is only the now methods of Instant that aren't idempotent.  Currently, 'now' is already broken since the script will be calling it at slightly different times for each document.  @rjernst can probably better explain a possible solution at least for this last part.\n\nEdit: For 5.0, I completely agree with turning off support for caching involving scripts.  I think other solutions are longer term and need to be fully thought through.\n\nSecond Edit: @imotov pointed out that I don't mean idempotent, but rather a pure function.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/250547930","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20645#issuecomment-250547930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20645","id":250547930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDU0NzkzMA==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T18:16:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T18:16:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"your understanding is correct @jdconrad \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/251092494","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20645#issuecomment-251092494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20645","id":251092494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTA5MjQ5NA==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-03T12:22:28Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T12:22:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"A thought I had while reading along (for the easiest problems of those above) - should we remove support for  `now()` from painless and only support it as a script parameter? seems like it will give people what they want and be consistent (across shards?)/cacheable?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/251157140","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20645#issuecomment-251157140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20645","id":251157140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTE1NzE0MA==","user":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-03T16:39:17Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T16:39:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bleskes This is the correct way to do this.
