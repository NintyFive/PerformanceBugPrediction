I think the problem stemmed from my incomplete overview of license types ( i.e. the existence of long term registered trial licenses.)\r\n\r\n> Maybe if the license is not self generated, we want to reuse the expiration date opposed to the issue date + self generated duration (30 days)?\r\n\r\nI, now, think we can handle both self generated and registered trial licenses in the same manner. Just update the signature and reuse the expiration date from the original trial license. I'll push a PR shortly","performed_via_github_app":null}]
