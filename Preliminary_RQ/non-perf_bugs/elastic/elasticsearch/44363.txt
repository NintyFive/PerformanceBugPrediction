When transitive dependencies are explicitly disabled via `transitive = false` on either a dependency of configuration, Gradle translates this to a wildcard exclude on the dependency (or all dependencies when put on a configuration). This behavior seemed to [cause issues with some Ivy consumers](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/24879). It seems the most recent Ivy release now properly [supports](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY-1531) this scenario. We should confirm this is the case, and if possible, remove this custom handling from our build as it requires us to create a bunch of unnecessary configurations for state tracking which undoubtably come at a performance cost.","closed_by":{"login":"mark-vieira","id":4106672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4106672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-vieira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
