The `size` that \r\nthis page is referring to is that of the search's â€” not the aggregation.\r\n\r\nHere is the `size` that the aggregation docs are referring to: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-body.html#_parameters_4 (the size parameter). \r\n\r\nYour reproduction step suggests you've updated the [term's aggregation `size`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html#_size).\r\n\r\nIf you set size on the whole query context, not that specific `age` aggregation, all should work!\r\n\r\nlet me know if that made sense or resolved the issue","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/321703032","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26150#issuecomment-321703032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26150","id":321703032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTcwMzAzMg==","user":{"login":"jbek7","id":2989603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2989603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbek7","html_url":"https://github.com/jbek7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbek7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbek7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbek7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbek7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbek7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbek7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbek7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbek7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbek7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-10T23:50:16Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T23:50:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I got it now.
