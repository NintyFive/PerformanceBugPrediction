Debian takes a while to do a major release, so these issues take a while to rear their head (it wasn't an issue in Debian 8 and Debian 9 was only released a few months ago).\r\n\r\nGiven that the setup guide is still publicly hosted at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/setup-repositories.html and instructs this, I think this is still a current issue.\r\n\r\nI understand if you disagree on the basis of not wanting to support old versions in any way at all.  If that's the case, maybe those old docs should be removed or provide a disclaimer?  Anyway, I'll proceed to explain how I think this could be fixed, in case you're amenable to my opinion.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this is related to the way that repository is signed.  From [this answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/387054/64423):\r\n\r\n> The cause of the problem is that . . . support for keys that state a preference for SHA-1 encryption has been turned off in APT as of Debian 9. . . .\r\n> \r\n> So a repository publisher needs to do two things:\r\n> \r\n> . . .\r\n>\r\n> * Adjust the preferences _that are contained in the current repository signing key_ to eliminate SHA-1 from there too.  For that one needs to:\r\n>   * Run <pre>gpg --edit-key \"${key_fingerprint}\"</pre> substituting the appropriate key fingerprint, then edit the key preferences with the `pref` and `setpref` commands, then save the key to the keyring.\r\n>   * Export the public key of the updated key from the keyring to a file.\r\n>   * **Re-sign the repository with the modified signing key.**\r\n>   * Publish the updated signing key's public key file.\r\n\r\nI added emphasis to \"Re-sign the repository with the modified signing key.\"  I tried [the latest instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html):\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -\r\necho \"deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the key looks the same, and I got no warnings.  So I'm guessing the newer repositories were re-signed with the modified signing key, but the older ones weren't.  Would you be willing to check if the old ones aren't, and re-sign them to see if that fixes the issue?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/376921832","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17724#issuecomment-376921832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17724","id":376921832,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjkyMTgzMg==","user":{"login":"sylvainbx","id":5102799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDI3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5102799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvainbx","html_url":"https://github.com/sylvainbx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvainbx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvainbx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvainbx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvainbx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvainbx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvainbx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvainbx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvainbx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylvainbx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T15:09:28Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T15:09:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The following workaround allows the install to pass:\r\n```bash\r\necho \"deb [trusted=yes] http://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/1.7/debian stable main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elasticsearch-1.7.list\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/376931219","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17724#issuecomment-376931219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17724","id":376931219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjkzMTIxOQ==","user":{"login":"jacksonrayhamilton","id":5356588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTY1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5356588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonrayhamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/jacksonrayhamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonrayhamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonrayhamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonrayhamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonrayhamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonrayhamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonrayhamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonrayhamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonrayhamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksonrayhamilton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T15:35:06Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T15:35:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@sylvainbx unfortunately, that still doesn’t suppress the warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nW: GPG error: http://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/1.7/debian stable Release: The following signatures were invalid: 46095ACC8548582C1A2699A9D27D666CD88E42B4\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaintainers, I see that my last post has 5 people agreeing with it.

End of life is end of life; the last 1.7 release (1.7.6) was on November 22, 2016, and we announced at that time that it would be the last release in the 1.7 series with it going end-of-life on January 16, 2017. The Debian packages can be downloaded from our downloads page to workaround this issue, but doing maintenance on the repository to avoid this issue is not something that we are going to do since it is end of life. I am sure that this is disappointing and that it seems unnecessarily strict but we draw a hard line to focus our capacity on maintaining and advancing our active versions.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
