Since we prefix-compress values, we can just map IPv4 addresses to IPv6 space and it works for both types. This is consistent with what InetAddress does itself anyway.\n\nWe should look at what needs to be done to support IPv6 in Elasticsearch. We should add a new `ipv6` field which handles both IPv4 and IPv6.  \n\nThe only problem I can see is that users might expect to get an IPv4 address back (eg `192.168.1.5`) and instead it'd be returned as `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:c0a8:105`. Perhaps we should have an `ipv4` field as well that handles only IPv4 addresses, or add some option to render as IPv4 when possible?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
