The number `1416` that you get back is the pid assigned to the curl process. The error returned by elasticsearch is due to the missing body for that request. The other \"command not found\" error that you see is the rest of your command that gets executed as a second command.\nYou just need to wrap your url in single quotes: \n\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_msearch?timeout=30000&ignore_unavailable=true' --data-binary @requests; echo\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
