I've run into a little race condition-ish problem concerning sending an update request for a document after its TTL has expired but before ES has run the TTL cleanup.\n\nHere are the replication steps:\n\n``` shell\n% curl -XPUT localhost:9200/test-ttl -d '{\n   \"settings\" : {\n     \"index.number_of_shards\" : 1,\n     \"index.number_of_replicas\" : 0\n   },\n   \"mappings\" : {\n     \"test-doc\" : {\n       \"_ttl\" : {\n         \"enabled\" : true,\n         \"default\" : \"1m\"\n       }\n     }\n   }\n }'\n% curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/test-ttl/test-doc/1' -d '{ \"title\" : \"test title\" }'\n% curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/test-ttl/test-doc/1/_update' -d '{ \"doc\" : { \"title\" : \"test update title\" } }'\n```\n\nIn another window, I have this running:\n\n``` shell\n% while true ; do date ; curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/test-ttl/test-doc/1?pretty=true&fields=title,_ttl' ; sleep 1 ; done\n```\n\nWhile that's running, I can watch the `_ttl` field decrease. When it becomes negative, the document is in a state such that its TTL has expired, but ES hasn't yet run the cleanup step. I can still retrieve the document, even though technically speaking it's \"expired\".\n\nWhen the document is in this state, if I do:\n\n``` shell\n% curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/test-ttl/test-doc/1/_update' -d '{ \"doc\" : { \"title\" : \"test update title\" } }'\n```\n\n... I get the following error message:\n\n``` javascript\n{\"error\":\"ElasticSearchIllegalArgumentException[TTL value must be > 0. Illegal value provided [-209]]\",\"status\":400}\n```\n\nI raised this on the elasticsearch users mailing list and Benjamin Deveze suggested I open an issue for it, so here it is!\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
