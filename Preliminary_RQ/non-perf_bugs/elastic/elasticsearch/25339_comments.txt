I just looked at the documentation of the [range query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-range-query.html#ranges-on-dates) and I think this covers it nicely. The [date range aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-daterange-aggregation.html#CO79-2) might need some reference to that as well, however thats not what you are using in your example. We accept pull requests for documentation, so if you want to take a stab at clarifying this its much appreciated.
