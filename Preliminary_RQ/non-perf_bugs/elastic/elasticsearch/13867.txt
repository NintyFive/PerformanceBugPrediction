There are two things ideally to check:\n- `@Inject`ed methods/constructors are public and their classes are public.\n- subclasses of `TransportRequest` are public and have a public no-arg constructor\n\nI tried to make sure those things delivered good exceptions when fixing the code this way initially. I also used grep and IDE class hierarchy and stuff, and spent a lot of time. But 2.x is a different codebase, which will change too, and it would be nicer if the build failed with a static scan somehow. It could be a separate evil tool we launch from ant even. :)\n\nHere is the meat of my changes so you get the idea:\n\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/e1efd5f6baf8dec1c23c79b346b8a29f234a98bb\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
