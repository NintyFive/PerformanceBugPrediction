https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/47678#issuecomment-633376927\r\n\r\nThe contributing guide says:\r\n\r\n> You can run Elasticsearch without building all the artifacts with:\r\n>\r\n> ```\r\n> ./gradlew :run\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> You can access Elasticsearch with:\r\n>\r\n> ```\r\n> curl -u elastic:password localhost:9200\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nBut, since `:run` never terminates, a new contributor may not realise that this task will eventually hit a point when ES is now _running_ and is ready for input (the `curl` step).\r\n\r\nIt would be good to update that doc with a little more explanation so that it's clear what to expect and how to proceed.\r\n
