Its nice to wake up to something!\n\nAnyway, the issue is one of scale for me.  Right now I do way too much random IO and this offers me a chance to reduce it pretty significantly.  Its like a 1:8 savings for me right now and it'll only get better as we add more fields that we have to query with weight.  I wouldn't propose something so hacky if I felt I knew another way to get that kind of performance boost.\n\nI'm happy to relegate this to the land of plugins.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/48911945","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6847#issuecomment-48911945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6847","id":48911945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTExOTQ1","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-14T15:09:57Z","updated_at":"2014-07-14T15:09:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nik9000 I'll reopen this and mark it for discussion \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/48956051","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6847#issuecomment-48956051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6847","id":48956051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTU2MDUx","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-14T20:37:09Z","updated_at":"2014-07-14T20:37:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not that it makes it less janky, but this dovetails with #6599.
