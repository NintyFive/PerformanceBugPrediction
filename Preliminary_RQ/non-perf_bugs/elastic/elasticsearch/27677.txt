You can avoid racing the clock by disabling allocation before shutting down the node:\r\n\r\nPUT _cluster/settings\r\n{\r\n  \"persistent\": {\r\n    \"cluster.routing.allocation.enable\": \"none\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nHowever this should be transient settings. Later on it says to use transient to re-enable:\r\n\r\nReenable shard allocation.\r\n\r\nOnce the node has joined the cluster, reenable shard allocation to start using the node:\r\n\r\nPUT _cluster/settings\r\n{\r\n  \"transient\": {\r\n    \"cluster.routing.allocation.enable\": \"all\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nShouldn't you use transient only? Basically if you were to do a full cluster restart at some point (without disabling allocation), the persistent setting would only apply and allocation is disabled. While transient setting takes precedent over persistent, this is not clearly spelled out in the docs. Also I think it can lead to confusion as to how to enable or disable allocation using transient vs persistent.
