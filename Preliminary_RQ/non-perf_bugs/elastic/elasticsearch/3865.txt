Would it be  possible to change the same settings on specific nodes?\n\nI looked at implementing the feature myself. A ClusterUpdateSettingsRequest is a subclass of MasterNodeOperationRequest and not NodesOperationRequest. The latter takes in a list of nodeIds that the operation should be executed on. I considered making a new UpdateSettingsRequest based on NodesOperationRequest, but from what I can tell, the settings are saved in the cluster state. If I inject the ClusterService, can I execute commands only on the local node (I assume that means working only with the DiscoveryNode)? Not sure if requests are propagated if not using a MasterNodeOperationRequest . Persistent updates that span restarts are not a concern for me since the settings are merely for A/B testing and final changes will be made permanent via the config file. The settings are tied to the cluster state and I do not think I can break the dependency (from the little of the code that I have read).\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
