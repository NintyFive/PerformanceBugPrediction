Lucene uses it in its `ConcurrentMergeScheduler` though to choose some default values. But as we only use our own custom subclass `ElasticsearchConcurrentMergeScheduler` which overrides these default choices of Lucene anyway, we can get rid of this flag completely.\r\n\r\n2. **Choose file store based on OS**\r\n\r\nThis will still not solve issues like #24361 because the underlying problem is that [we iterate over all file stores when initializing `Environment`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/382a617/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/env/Environment.java#L107-L114).\r\n\r\nThe reason why we do this is to work around [JDK-8034057](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8034057). However, this bug only affects Windows and we can choose the file store based on OS already (see [ESFileStore](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/382a617/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/env/ESFileStore.java#L100)). By leveraging this mechanisms, we can get rid of iteration thus accessing only file stores that we actually need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
