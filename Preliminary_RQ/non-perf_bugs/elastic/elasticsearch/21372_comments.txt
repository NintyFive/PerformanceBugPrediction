You have have to pass the language in with the request in these cases.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/259032787","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21372#issuecomment-259032787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21372","id":259032787,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTAzMjc4Nw==","user":{"login":"small-tomorrow","id":16282334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjgyMzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16282334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow","html_url":"https://github.com/small-tomorrow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-08T03:05:55Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T03:05:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley  thank you  ! but  that is wired , if language param is allowed in the request cases , why can't we change the language in a global way ?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/259083547","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21372#issuecomment-259083547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21372","id":259083547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTA4MzU0Nw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-08T09:10:29Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T09:10:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@small-tomorrow because groovy, javascript, python are deprecated and will be removed in 6.0, so we want you to actively think about the fact that you're using a deprecated feature, so that it doesn't come as a surprise later on\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/259353762","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21372#issuecomment-259353762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21372","id":259353762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTM1Mzc2Mg==","user":{"login":"small-tomorrow","id":16282334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjgyMzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16282334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow","html_url":"https://github.com/small-tomorrow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/small-tomorrow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T07:58:00Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T07:58:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley okay , thank you very much , it seems we'd better upgrade the requests code in time\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
