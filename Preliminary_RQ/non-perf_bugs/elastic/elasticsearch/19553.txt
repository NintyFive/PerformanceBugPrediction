For example, imagine this trivial situation where you don't want to show numbers without a total:\n\n``` http\nGET /test/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"group_by_number\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"field\": \"number\"\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"group_by_total\": {\n          \"terms\": {\n            \"field\": \"total\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"min_bucket_selector\": {\n          \"bucket_selector\": {\n            \"buckets_path\": {\n              \"count\": \"group_by_total._bucket_count\"\n            },\n            \"script\": {\n              \"inline\": \"count != 0\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf `total` were a metric aggregation (e.g., `sum`), then it would be possible to use it. But as a bucketed aggregation, it makes it impossible to use to ignore parent buckets.\n\n/cc @colings86\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
