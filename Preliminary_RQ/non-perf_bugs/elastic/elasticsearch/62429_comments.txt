Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/693261648","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62429#issuecomment-693261648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62429","id":693261648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MzI2MTY0OA==","user":{"login":"CSuperC","id":6159471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTk0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6159471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CSuperC","html_url":"https://github.com/CSuperC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CSuperC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CSuperC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CSuperC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CSuperC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CSuperC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CSuperC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CSuperC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CSuperC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CSuperC/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-16T08:37:09Z","updated_at":"2020-09-16T08:37:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cbuescher ok，i will go there ，thank you~","performed_via_github_app":null}]
