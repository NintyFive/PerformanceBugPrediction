has low-level protection that blocks incoming segment-producing threads (indexing threads, NRT reopen threads, commit, etc.) when there are too many merges running.\n\nBut this is too harsh for Elasticsearch, so it's entirely disabled, but this means merges can fall far behind under heavy indexing, and this results in too many segments in the index, which causes all sorts of problems (slow version lookups, too much RAM, etc.).\n\nSo we need to do something \"softer\"; Simon has a good starting patch, which I tested and confirmed (after https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5644 is fixed) at least in one use-case that it prevents too many segments in the index:\n\nBefore Simon's + Lucene's fix: http://people.apache.org/~mikemccand/lucenebench/base.html\n\nSame test with the fix: http://people.apache.org/~mikemccand/lucenebench/throttled.html\n\nSegment counts stay essentially flat.\n\nHere's Simon's prototype patch:
