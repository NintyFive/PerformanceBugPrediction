realize the percentiles aggregations is still experimental which is probably the cause for this: \n\nhttps://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/metrics/percentiles/PercentilesParser.java#L60\n\nThe routine that is currently in place to write the percentiles `non_keyed` output will write the aggregation like this:\n\n```\n\"aggs\" : {\n  \"my_percentiles\": [\n       { .. }, \n       { .. }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/metrics/percentiles/InternalPercentiles.java#L131\n\nMaking it the only aggregation to directly return an array instead of within a wrapped object. \n\n```\n\"aggs\" : {\n    \"my_percentiles\": { \n        percentiles: [\n           { .. }, \n           { .. }\n
