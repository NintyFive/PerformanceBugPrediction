These settings require setting the setting to each node and restarting the node. For example, `max.anomaly.records` limits the number of records that our output per bucket to 500 by default. There has been users requesting increasing that limit. We should update that setting to be a dynamic cluster setting and deprecate the old one. At the same time, it would be good to review other similar settings.","closed_by":{"login":"benwtrent","id":4357155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTcxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4357155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent","html_url":"https://github.com/benwtrent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
