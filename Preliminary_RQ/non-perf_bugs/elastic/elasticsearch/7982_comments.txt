You might try using the fast vector highlighter with `matched_fields`.\n\nIf you need the ultimate in rope to hang yourself with https://github.com/wikimedia/search-highlighter supports highlighting regular expressions [1].  For that matter it also supports `matched_fields` without as much index space overhead as the fast vector highlighter and other fun stuff like `skip_if_last_matched` so it might be worth looking at any way.\n\nFull disclosure: I maintain the plugin so I'm probably a bigger fan of it then I should be.\n\n[1]: There is a bug in regex highlighting and unicode characters which I've fixed but haven't released a new version to pick it up.
