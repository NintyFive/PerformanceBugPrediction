You can see from explain output or validating the query with a rewrite what it's being rewritten to. In the converse example, since it has an actual field, it throws an exception since it doesn't allow leading wildcards.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/283337815","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23356#issuecomment-283337815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23356","id":283337815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzMzNzgxNQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T13:21:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T13:21:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I wonder if we shouldn't rewrite `field:*` to an exists query instead?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/283342660","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23356#issuecomment-283342660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23356","id":283342660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzM0MjY2MA==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T13:43:04Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T13:43:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I wonder if we shouldn't rewrite field:* to an exists query instead?\r\n\r\nThat's what the code is trying to do but it's working only when `default_field` or `fields` contain the field `content`.\r\n\r\nThis query for instance:\r\n`````\r\nGET _validate/query?explain&rewrite\r\n{\r\n   \"query\": {\r\n      \"query_string\": {\r\n         \"query\": \"foo:*\",\r\n         \"default_field\": \"foo\",\r\n         \"allow_leading_wildcard\": false,\r\n         \"analyze_wildcard\": false\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n`````\r\nreturns:\r\n\r\n`````\r\n{\r\n   \"valid\": true,\r\n   \"_shards\": {\r\n      \"total\": 1,\r\n      \"successful\": 1,\r\n      \"failed\": 0\r\n   },\r\n   \"explanations\": [\r\n      {\r\n         \"index\": \"t\",\r\n         \"valid\": true,\r\n         \"explanation\": \"ConstantScore(_field_names:foo)\"\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n`````\r\n\r\nSo basically this is a bug, we should not create query like `field:*` but rather rely on the exists query.
