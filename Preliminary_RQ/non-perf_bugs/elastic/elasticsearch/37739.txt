It seems that when there are nodes failures, the low-level `RestClient` may have a race condition around keeping track of the valid nodes. Here's the relevant text from the report:\r\n\r\n> When too many nodes fail, an IllegalCapacityException is thrown in the low level RestClient.\r\n> Defective Code is in line 637:\r\n> ```\r\n> List<Node> livingNodes = new ArrayList<>(nodeTuple.nodes.size() - blacklist.size());\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> In some cases `nodeTuple.nodes.size() - blacklist.size() < 0`, which causes an `IllegalCapacityException` thrown by the `ArrayList` constructor.\r\n> \r\n> This causes the `RestClient` to fail on any further request (including requests issued by the sniffer), thus the client breaks down completely and will not recover.\r\n> \r\n> I think the situation is caused by nodes failing. Then:\r\n> - The sniffer removes a node using RestClient.setNodes(...)\r\n> - There are async requests running on that nodes that fail after the sniffer removed the node\r\n> - Thus, the node (which is not contained in the RestClient.nodeTuple list anymore) is added to the RestClient.blackList during RestClient.onFailure\r\n> - Therefore, a situation where more nodes are blacklisted that nodes are known can occur.","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
