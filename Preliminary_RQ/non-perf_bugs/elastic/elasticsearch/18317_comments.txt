On all systems except for running Elasticsearch as a service on Windows, the thread stack size setting is not needed and we can pick up the JVM defaults. The issue when running Elasticsearch as a service on Windows is that `procrun` requires min heap, max heap and thread stack size to be set. Thus, we ship with out-of-the-box settings that work for all cases except running Windows as a service. We use to set this in the service installer, but the issue there is that moves a piece of the JVM configuration out of the jvm.options file negating the point of the introduction of that configuration file.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/219019611","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18317#issuecomment-219019611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18317","id":219019611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTAxOTYxMQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T11:36:11Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T11:36:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for reporting.
