The underlying issue is SearchLookup uses a shared object across documents for source (and doc values). This object should not be held onto across documents, yet we may hold onto it if returning from a script field (note that this could happen in other contexts that return Object as well). Unfortunately I don't think the associated PR will completely fix the issue, as it would only catch the case of a root object being a source lookup, but the script could return eg a Map containing the source lookup as a value.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of a better solution right now, but we plan to discuss this in our scripting triage over the next week.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/584431432","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52103#issuecomment-584431432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52103","id":584431432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDQzMTQzMg==","user":{"login":"tilan7663","id":7594121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTQxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7594121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilan7663","html_url":"https://github.com/tilan7663","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilan7663/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilan7663/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilan7663/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilan7663/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilan7663/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilan7663/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilan7663/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilan7663/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilan7663/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-11T00:54:25Z","updated_at":"2020-02-11T00:54:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rjernst Thanks for looking into it.
