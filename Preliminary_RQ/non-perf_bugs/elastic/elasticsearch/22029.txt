is resolved while starting the node but I'm not entirely sure this makes sense.\r\n\r\nThis setting is a great way to advertise CNAME to http clients that might not be resolvable on the network the nodes themselves live on or the firewall they are behind.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nhttp.publish_host: elastic.co\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### GET /_nodes/http?pretty=true\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"_nodes\" : {\r\n

per #21630 does not seem to extend to these
