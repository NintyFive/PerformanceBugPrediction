In our environment we use Cloudera Distribution Hadoop, so we need to supply these jars on startup into the Elasticsearch Java classpath.\nhttps://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-hadoop/tree/master/repository-hdfs\n\nAs another point of reference, we're also using the official Puppet module in our environment so this problem would apply to both the supplied RPM files here as well as the Puppet file templates.\nhttps://github.com/elasticsearch/puppet-elasticsearch/blob/master/templates/etc/init.d/elasticsearch.RedHat.erb\n\nCurrently, I provide `ES_CLASSPATH=\"$ES_CLASSPATH:/path/to/hadoop/jars\"` in our /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch and add an additional line in /etc/init.d/elasticsearch `export ES_CLASSPATH` (since the official Puppet module doesn't support `export ES_CLASSPATH=\"...\"` directly).\n\nShould the SysV init script include `export ES_CLASSPATH` like the other `export ES_JAVA_OPTS`, `export ES_HEAP_SIZE`, etc. environments variables in there for consistency? I wouldn't mind submitting a pull request to add this if it makes sense.\n\nThanks!\nBrian\n","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
