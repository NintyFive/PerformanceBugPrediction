So, they are not accessible using doc lookup in the facet that you run on the top documents unless you set `include_in_root` or `include_in_parent` to true See [Nested Type Mapping](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-nested-type.html) page of documentation for more details. You can also access the source of the document (with all nested documents) using source lookup (`_source`), or switch to a nested facet, which works on nested documents. \n\nIf you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask them in the [mailing list](http://www.elasticsearch.org/help/). The mailing list is the perfect place to ask questions like this one. You can use github issues for bug reports and enhancements requests. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
