Across Kibana and ES, we can agree to use specific keys to define added behavior that benefits both sides, such as `cluster.metadata.display_name`.\r\n\r\nWe can use that as a way to allow the user to override the `cluster_name` (e.g., if it was never set or it is set to something like a UUID) as described in https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/23022. The easiest approach would be to explicitly grab that key and include it in the `cluster_stats`, or possibly include all of the `cluster.metadata` key/value pairs and simply have the UI pluck the one that is interesting.","closed_by":{"login":"ycombinator","id":51061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/51061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator","html_url":"https://github.com/ycombinator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
