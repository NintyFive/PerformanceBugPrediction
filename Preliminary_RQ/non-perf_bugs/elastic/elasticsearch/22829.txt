I guess it's handy to expose it for debugging purposes and for completeness' sake.\r\n\r\nThat said the current logic allows to update it which leads to weird scenarios. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT index/type/1\r\n{\r\n  \"f\": 1\r\n}\r\n\r\nPOST index/type/1/_update\r\n{\r\n  \"script\": {\r\n    \"inline\": \"ctx._source.f=2; ctx._version = 5\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nGET index/type/1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill totally ignore the version change and the doc version will be set to 2 (assuming first command created it).\r\n\r\nWith reindexing you can do funkier stuff:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST _reindex\r\n{\r\n  \"source\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"index\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dest\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"myindex_new\",\r\n    \"version_type\": \"external\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"script\": {\r\n    \"inline\": \"if (ctx._source.f == 1) {ctx._version++;}\",\r\n    \"lang\": \"painless\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis script will actually cause the version field in the target index to be set to the result of the script. I think this is dangerous and we shouldn't allow it (even though it might be handy in some extreme cases).\r\n\r\nIMO we should make `ctx._version` immutable and throw an exception if someone changes it.","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
