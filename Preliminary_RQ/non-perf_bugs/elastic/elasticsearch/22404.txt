Where you can specify how much needs to match but depending on the target, other doucment its field. \r\n\r\n**example**\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n document 1: {\r\n     \"productDescription\": \"this is an article about computer related things, for example hp computers screens\"  \r\n   }\r\n\r\n   target document1: {\r\n     \"product\": \"hp computer \"\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   target document2 : {\r\n     \"product\": \"hp laptop \"\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   target document3 : {\r\n     \"product\": \"dell computer screen\"\r\n   }\r\n\r\n    \"query\" : {\r\n      \"must\": match{\r\n        \"product\": \"this is an article about computer related things, for example hp computers screens\"  \r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nNow if i execute this query i will get document 3 then 1 then 2. \r\n\r\nBut i would like to be able to set the target match percentage. This would enable me to say that it has to match a certain percentage of the words of the target. \r\nThen a 100% match would only return document 1 and not 3 because it isn't a perfect match.
