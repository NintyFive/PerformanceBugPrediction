But what I was looking for was:\n\nIf name is like : \"i am trying to test me\"\n\nanother name as : \"I am trying tost me also\"\n\nanother name as : \"I am trying to st me also\"\n\nand if i query \"st me\", it should return me all three rows row. But the \"name:\\\"st me\\\"\" returns me only 3rd one. Not 2nd and 1st one.\n\nIts basically in oracle as : name like '%st me%'.\n\nBasically what I am looking for is a free form search, if query string is contained in name.\n\nHope you could help me with this.
