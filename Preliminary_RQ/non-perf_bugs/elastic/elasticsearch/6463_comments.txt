There is already a Size parameter for query/filter.\n\nThe problem is the programmer is responsible to do that, and some times he will not understand what big size parameter in query/filter would cause in production environment.\n\nA maximum size in the entire cluster or index would help avoiding cluster shutdown. But I think it would be better count how many documents are available and then cut off pre-allocated memory that would not be used.\n\nRegards.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/59473017","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6463#issuecomment-59473017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6463","id":59473017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDczMDE3","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-17T06:51:48Z","updated_at":"2014-10-17T06:51:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing in favour of #8080 \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
