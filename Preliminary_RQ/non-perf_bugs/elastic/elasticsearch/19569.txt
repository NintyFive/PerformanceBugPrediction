In order to do that, thought of disabling refresh until I index all the documents and then do a forcemerge/enable refresh explicitly to make them searchable at the same time. However I noticed , even after disabling refresh, the documents get updated after 5 minutes automitically. \n\nThe way I understand is refresh is equivalent to Lucene flush which would write to segments and make them searchable after 1 second. I also tried a huge interval of transaction logs flush. The settings are as under \ntranslog\": { \n\"flush_threshold_size\": \"1024mb\", \n\"sync_interval\": \"60m\", \n\"flush_threshold_period\": \"60m\", \n\"fs\": { \n\"type\": \"simple\" \n}\n\nPlease let me know if this is achievable in Elasticsearch.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
