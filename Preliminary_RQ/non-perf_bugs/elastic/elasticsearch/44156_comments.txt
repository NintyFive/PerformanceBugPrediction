A theoretical bug that's existed since 6.6 that would cause the ML memory tracker to become permanently blocked if `onFailure` rather than `onResponse` was called on one of the lower level handlers.  However, there has been no known case of this being suffered by a user, nor has it been seen in any testing prior to 7.3.\r\n2. The fact that in 7.3 we have added a path that is basically guaranteed to trigger the bug, rendering ML completely non-operational.\r\n\r\nSo it is the combination that makes this a blocker for 7.3.0.\r\n\r\nI will fix it in two stages:\r\n\r\n1. A fix to the problem of `onFailure` completely blocking up the ML memory tracker.  I'll backport this to 6.8 as theoretically it could be a problem in this version if some really obscure problem happens and it would be difficult to diagnose if a user reported it - the bug report would basically be \"ML doesn't work at all\", and that's time-consuming to tie down to a particular root cause.\r\n2. An extra check in 7.3.0 and above that prevents the node assignment of data frame analytics jobs at node startup from triggering a failure of the ML memory tracker.  Even when the ML memory tracker recovers from failures it's best to avoid the log spam and confusion they'll cause.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/510433512","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44156#issuecomment-510433512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44156","id":510433512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDQzMzUxMg==","user":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-11T10:42:38Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T10:42:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed by a combination of #44158 and #44170.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
