However if I change the time range to target some of the most recent documents for example:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"range\": {\r\n        \"@timestamp\": {\r\n            \"gte\": \"now-2d/d\",\r\n            \"lt\": \"now/d\",\r\n            \"time_zone\": \"US/Pacific\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get hits back but no aggregations, I can confirm that there is documents matching the time range I provided and the data format has not changed either.\r\n\r\nOnly thing I can think of is that I recently upgraded to `ES 6.1.0` from `ES 6.0.0`\r\nI found this odd that ES computes aggregations for slice of documents containing older documents but does not compute aggregations for newer documents.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have opened an thread at https://discuss.elastic.co/t/es-6-1-0-aggregations-empty/112100 and opening an issue here for more visibility.
