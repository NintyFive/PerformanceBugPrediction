The `collapsing` is done on the `top_hits` only in order to provide a fast and accurate solution. Returning the accurate number of distinct groups would defeat the purpose as it would be slow and costly to compute. \r\nThough you can use the `cardinality` aggregation in the same query to get an approximate number of distinct group on the field (`collapsing` does not modify the aggregations):\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
