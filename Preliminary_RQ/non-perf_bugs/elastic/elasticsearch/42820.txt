The Datafeed needs to automatically account for either a raw `geo_point` or a `geo_centroid` (in the event of aggregated data) data point. The formatting (comma delimited string) should happen automatically in the Datafeed before it sends the data back to the ML process. \r\n\r\nIn short, for the `lat_long` detector, a Datafeed should support data from: `geo_point` field, `geo_centroid` agg, `geo_shape` field (point type only), and the legacy (current) scripted field option.\r\n\r\nThis will require a fair bit of work within the extractor logic and some within the validation logic.
