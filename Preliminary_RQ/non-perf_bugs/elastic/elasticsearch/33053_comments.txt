It can be applied at various levels in a document hierarchy to limit the fields introduced.\r\n\r\nIf you can't prevent unwanted field introduction with `strict` then there are a number of strategies that can aid the detection of the offending template source:\r\n1) On index creation the list of templates that were applied is logged (but not the details of which fields came from which template)\r\n2) In your index template you can associate arbitrary information in the \"meta\" part of the index mapping - you could use this to include information about templates, versions, fields , author etc\r\n3) We have plans to introduce more granular `meta` information down to field-level (do you have an issue you can share @ruflin ?) which, like 2) would allow recording of your template source in the mapping but applies down to field-level .\r\n\r\nClosing given the options presented here.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/415761364","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33053#issuecomment-415761364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33053","id":415761364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTc2MTM2NA==","user":{"login":"ruflin","id":244900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDkwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/244900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruflin","html_url":"https://github.com/ruflin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruflin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruflin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruflin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruflin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruflin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruflin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruflin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruflin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruflin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-24T13:38:11Z","updated_at":"2018-08-24T13:38:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markharwood There is no public issue for 3) yet. @jpountz Should we start one or too early?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
