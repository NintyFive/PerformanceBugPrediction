If I use wildcard query to search \"entit_\", that document is returned.  However, if I use wildcard query to do a phrase search \"interest_entit_\", that document is not found.  I also tried with prefix query as well as wildcard query with \"interest entit_\", no document is found either.  \n\nI would expect follow query to work according to ElasticSearch document:  http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_literal_wildcard_literal_and_literal_regexp_literal_queries.html\n\n  {\"wildcard\":{\"document\":\"interest_entit_\"}}\n\nThe document was indexed using standard tokenizer and standard filter, which should be not stemmed. \n\nWe are using ElaticSearch 1.1.0.\n\nDoes anyone has any advices on this?
