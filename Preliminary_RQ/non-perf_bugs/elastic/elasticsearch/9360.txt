The bug occurs when you index a document containing two simple polygons and then query for shape which intersect a polygon representing a ring around (but not touching) the two indexed shapes. The query returns the document when it shouldn't since neither of the shapes interact with the ring.\n\nChanging the `relation` option to either `within` or `disjoint` produce no results from the query.\n\n[1] https://gist.github.com/colings86/0a0184ba79c5367685ff\n\nThis bug was raised from the following mailing list post: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elasticsearch/TlqaVu91R7A\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
