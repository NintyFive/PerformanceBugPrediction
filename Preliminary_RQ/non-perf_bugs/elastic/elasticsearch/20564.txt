In the past those `onModule` methods were called via reflection and received some specific guice module as an argument and allowed to do many things with it, probably too many.\n\nNow that there is a replacement, it makes sense to deprecate these onModule methods, but I don't get why we would leave them behind, make them final, hence unusable by plugins, and deprecate them at the same time. Either they should be usable but deprecated, or they should be gone. Making them final is the same as removing them I think? What we have now just makse people that used them angry I think :) Or maybe there are reasons why this was done that I am missing, not sure.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
