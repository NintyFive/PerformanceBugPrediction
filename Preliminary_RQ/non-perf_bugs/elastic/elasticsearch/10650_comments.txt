This is so to support the recommended setup where the monitoring data is sent to another cluster, to be available in case of trouble. By default, and for easy of first use, we ship data locally by pick up on the address of the local node. Since the traffic is going from the node to itself, we choose to pick on what ES calls the binding host and not the published IP (which what ES tells to other nodes to use when connecting to it). If not configured, ES will pick up the any local address, IPv4 or IPv6 depending on defaults. In your ES bound to `[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0]:9200` but it doesn't route correctly. To work this, you can either configure marvel to use an explicit IP, or tell ES to bind ES to a specific ip via `network.bind_host` in your elasticsearch.yml file. There are also some special reserved \"hosts\", see http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html#modules-network . \n\nLet me know if this works for you.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/172357736","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10650#issuecomment-172357736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10650","id":172357736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjM1NzczNg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-17T17:44:07Z","updated_at":"2016-01-17T17:44:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing as Marvel 2 has been released\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
