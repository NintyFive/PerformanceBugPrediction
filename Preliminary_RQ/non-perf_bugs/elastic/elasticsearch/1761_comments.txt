Your java is not setup to use the proxy so it doesn't work in command line.\n\n> How I can manually setup the river-couchdb plugin?\n\nUnzip the zip file in `elasticsearch/plugins/river-couchdb`.\nRestart your node and look at logs. You should find the couchdb river loaded as a plugin.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/11384224","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1761#issuecomment-11384224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1761","id":11384224,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzg0MjI0","user":{"login":"Ganican","id":2616768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTY3Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2616768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ganican","html_url":"https://github.com/Ganican","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ganican/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ganican/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ganican/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ganican/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ganican/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ganican/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ganican/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ganican/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ganican/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-14T17:21:38Z","updated_at":"2012-12-14T17:21:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think it is initialized now...\n[2012-12-14 11:14:43,427][INFO ][org.elasticsearch.node   ] [Corbo, Jared] {0.20.1}[7776]: initializing ...\n[2012-12-14 11:14:43,454][INFO ][org.elasticsearch.plugins] [Corbo, Jared] loaded [river-couchdb], sites []\n[2012-12-14 11:14:46,577][INFO ][org.elasticsearch.node   ] [Corbo, Jared] {0.20.1}[7776]: initialized\n\nEven for the head plugin can I do the same ..that is\n\nUnzip the zip file in elasticsearch/plugins/head\n\nThanks for your help.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
