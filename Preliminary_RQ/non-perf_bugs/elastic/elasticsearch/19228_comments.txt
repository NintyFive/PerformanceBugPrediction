By setting `setConcurrentRequests(2)` the bulk processor is executing `bulkProcessor.flush()` asynchronously. This means that the index \"test\" is not created yet while you call refresh on it. Either set `setConcurrentRequests(0)` or wait on the `afterBulk` event using the `BulkProcessor.Listener` before doing a refresh.\n\nPlease ask questions like these in the forum instead: https://discuss.elastic.co/\n\nThe github issues list is reserved for bug reports and feature requests only.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
