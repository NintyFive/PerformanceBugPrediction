What we've found with Java and PermGen, is that if there is even the smallest leak of an object, upon a reload _all_ classes will be leaked. Basically the classloader can't release the dependency tree of the web app. Even with a PermGen of 512Mb we cannot redeploy our web app more than once before things blow up. All other dependencies we have (and we have quite a bit) have various hooks to close/shutdown when the web app is unloaded. Sometimes we have to dig for them but there's usually a way.\n\nI've seen various patches mentioned. Has anyone found a workaround while an official fix is being worked on?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/168647870","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/283#issuecomment-168647870","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/283","id":168647870,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODY0Nzg3MA==","user":{"login":"arivazhagan-jeganathan","id":15650133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjUwMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15650133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arivazhagan-jeganathan","html_url":"https://github.com/arivazhagan-jeganathan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arivazhagan-jeganathan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arivazhagan-jeganathan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arivazhagan-jeganathan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arivazhagan-jeganathan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arivazhagan-jeganathan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arivazhagan-jeganathan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arivazhagan-jeganathan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arivazhagan-jeganathan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arivazhagan-jeganathan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-04T11:08:54Z","updated_at":"2016-01-04T11:08:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi I am using elasticsearch 1.5.1 and Java 7.
