Some use hourly. The main way to access Elasticsearch in this use case is often Kibana.\n\nIn Elasticsearch 1.3.1 (and older, probably), aborts a query if the request line itself is longer than 4096 bytes, which limites the default logstash use case to about 195 days of querying (each day is 20 bytes of index name, plus comma, 4096 / 21 = 195.04;ignoring remainder of request line)\nFor hourly partitions, this limits you to 170 indices (7 days of data).\n\nIt would be lovely if users could still use these partitioning schemes and query more than 195 days (or 7 days, for hourly indexes) of data in a single query.\n\nRelated: https://github.com/elasticsearch/kibana/issues/1406\n","closed_by":{"login":"jordansissel","id":131818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTgxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/131818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansissel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
