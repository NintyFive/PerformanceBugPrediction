version 0.90.5, class `FacetParseElement`, method `parse`, line #86:\n\n```\nfilter = context.queryParserService().parseInnerFilter(parser).filter();\n```\n\nMethod `IndexQueryParserService.parseInnerFilter` is annotated as @Nullable and in fact it does return `null` in certain cases and it results in NPE in the aforementioned `FacetParseElement.parse` method.\n\nExamples of query that throws NPE:\n\n1) Empty 'facet_filter':\n\n```\n{\n  \"facets\": {\n    \"foo\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"match_all\": {}\n      },\n      \"facet_filter\":

    \"and\": {\n          \"filters\": []\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhile syntactically or semantically those queries might not be correct ElasticSearch should return a meaningful error rather than NPE.\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
