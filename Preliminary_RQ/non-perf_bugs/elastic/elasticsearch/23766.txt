The end result is that `fields`, `fielddata_fields` or `docvalue_fields` is not returned in the response and the end user will wonder if they have referenced an incorrect field name, if it's a bug, or if it is simply by design and have to be accessed a different way.\r\n\r\nFor nested fields, `fields`, `fielddata_fields` or `docvalue_fields` can only be accessed via `inner_hits`.
