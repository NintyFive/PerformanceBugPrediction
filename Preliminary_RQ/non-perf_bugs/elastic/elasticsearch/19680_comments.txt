It's actually called `post_filter` these days.  This is a filter that is applied after aggregations are calculated and before search hits are returned.\n\nThis ends up being indexed in the percolator as a field called `state.raw`, which is illegal.\n\nYour entire query should be under the `query` key, so you could do, for instance (using the query dsl syntax in 2.x):\n\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"must\": [\n        {\n          \"query_string\": {\n            \"query\": \"\\\"foo\\\"\",\n            \"default_operator\": \"AND\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"filter\": [\n        {\n          \"range\": {\n            \"date\": {\n              \"lt\": \"2016-04-30\",\n              \"gte\": \"1950-01-01\"\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"term\": {\n            \"state.raw\": \"foo\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
