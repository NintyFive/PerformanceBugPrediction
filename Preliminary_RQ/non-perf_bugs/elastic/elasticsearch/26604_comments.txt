But then it is stated that: `Instead, these settings should be set directly in the settings per repository. See S3 Repository settings.`.\r\n\r\nThis means that one should be able to set some of this using S3 repository settings, per repository. Which isn't true. As for example `path_style_access` cannot be used now.\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding the following:\r\n\r\n>  It is also not exactly true, it is just we no longer support untested settings which allowed working with older s3 compatible apis (namely ones that used legacy url formats and signing methods).\r\n\r\nFor example `path_style_access` allowed you to use some services that only support path style access. This isn't just old S3 compatible APIs but some other currently used APIs such as Cleversafe from IBM for example. And this is just a single example.\r\n\r\nThe main intention of this issue is to discuss whether it makes sense to add in the documentation that only `AWS S3` is intended to be used with the plugin.

We just use the official s3 client, and no longer expose any \"special\" settings. Instead of having our code support multiple styles of accessing the bucket (one of which was untested before), we are trying to consolidate and make sure we have exactly one access pattern. In the case of path style access, it is a little tricky because it depends on the endpoint. The java client will first find info about the bucket from the configured endpoint, and then choose which access style to use based on that. So, if the s3 compatible layer supports this information retrieval about the bucket, then it should \"automatically\" use the appropriate access style.  Essentially, we don't want to special case this in our case (have the flag), but instead rely on the client/sdk.\r\n\r\nI will add a note to the migration docs as you suggested, to clearly point out this setting has been removed.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/376185056","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26604#issuecomment-376185056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26604","id":376185056,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjE4NTA1Ng==","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T14:27:37Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T14:27:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rjernst can we close this?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/377061763","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26604#issuecomment-377061763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26604","id":377061763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzA2MTc2Mw==","user":{"login":"debadair","id":362578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjU3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/362578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair","html_url":"https://github.com/debadair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T22:41:12Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T22:41:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
