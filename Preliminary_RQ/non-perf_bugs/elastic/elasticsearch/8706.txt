During the time we index the documents we mark the primary as started but until the clusterstate is published on node 0 it depends on which node you hit for indexing if the doc goes into both shards or not. Now if you hit node 1 the doc only goes into the new started (relocated) primary. Yet if you are fast enough and hit node 0 for the delete we can't find the doc in the currently relocating (clusterstate is not yet updated) - the logic knows it needs to push the delete into the new primary on node 1 so it really get's deleted but we return the response from node 0 which has `isFound = false`\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
