There is no spike in app server requests, or in traffic between the app servers and ES nodes.\n\nWe have never been able to replicate this problem locally, only under a real production load. And even then, it will be fine for 12 hours (with some errors here and there no big deal) and then all of a sudden she fires up (like in the graph above) and we see CPU usage spike. Restart nodes, rinse wash and repeat.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/183928359","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14805#issuecomment-183928359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14805","id":183928359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MzkyODM1OQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-14T17:07:35Z","updated_at":"2016-02-14T17:07:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @travisbell \n\nI see no further info here, but looking at the error logs, it appears they are not the same errors but lots of different malformed queries/requests.
