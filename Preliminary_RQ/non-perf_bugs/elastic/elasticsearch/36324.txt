Such actions could include reindexing indices, removing deprecated settings, and so on.\r\n\r\nCurrently, to do this, a tool would have to read the issue description, which is not guaranteed to remain consistent, and would need a table mapping every issue type to an action.  We *may* be able to provide a simpler alternative through the deprecation API.\r\n\r\nOne option is to add an (optional) `recommended_actions` field, which indicates that an index needs to be reindexed, a setting needs to be removed or changed, etc.  Notably, this puts the onus of recommending actions in Elasticsearch's court.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to add a unique identifier to each issue type.  We are unlikely to do this, as it may impact future localization plans (see #35665).  This also does not resolve the problem of an external tool still needing a mapping of issue type to recommended action.\r\n\r\n/cc @joshdover ","closed_by":{"login":"joshdover","id":1813008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTMwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1813008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdover","html_url":"https://github.com/joshdover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdover/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
