Or rather expose some issues in Hadoop which are outside our control. However there are solutions.\n\nCurrently the plan is to move the plugin in ES core (see #15191). The plugin takes care of loading the Hadoop libraries from a dedicated folder to avoid jar hell (clashes of classes with the same name/package available in different jars) and also use the proper permissions (and do so in a way that makes the code use them).\nThe best solution in this case, when using a distro is to package/link the necessary jars in the plugin folder so they get picked up. If they are available in the bootstrapping classpath the plugin can't really do much there and it's up to you to handle that. Typically by enabling the needed permissions to the entire JVM (which is more or less the same as disabling the JVM security) and taking care of any duplicate jars ....\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
