If you want to verify, you enable trace logging for `index.warmer` and look for `top warming` in the logs.\n\nHave you verified that this is harming your performance in any meaningful way?

We've noticed some _correlation_ between high warmer activity and very high (~90%) heap, with virtually all of the heap usage promoted up to the \"old\" pool. Obviously this doesn't necessarily imply a causal link. Is there any documentation on what the top warmer does? That might lead us to some _other_ behavior or activity which might be a more likely culprit in the heap growth. I couldn't find anything by searching for `elasticsearch \"top warmer\"`.

All of the hot threads were warmer threads. We turned on trace logging for `index.warmer` and saw that the top warmer was running 2-3 times per second.
