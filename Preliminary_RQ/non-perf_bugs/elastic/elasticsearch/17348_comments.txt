and I am using such tapering modifiers as well but here is another example that may help.\n\nLet's say I also want to factor in cost. For most documents $10 to $100 is typical. I would expect that range to have a linear curve, representing how the average person feels about spending money on non-essentials. Now lets say that there is something that costs $1000 or $10,000, those are so far beyond the typical reach of most people that they are essentially the same but taking the log of each returns a substantial difference. Placing a max limit here would allow me to truncate these outliers as a way of saying, \"they're high cost but potentially still relevant\" and leaving it at that rather then (in my case) driving them way down in the relevance scale even if the cost is completely reasonable for this type of document.\n\nI should also point out that in the case of votes, those too can be a problem, even when scaled down with log. I want to give new documents a fighting chance of being seen even though they start out with 0 votes. If some other documents that is years old has many thousands of votes, even taking the log of that will create a major boost over the new document. Here again, it may be appropriate to say that those documents having 10 to 100 votes may be proportionately more relevant but all documents having a vote count of 100 or more may be considered simply \"popular\" without overwhelming the other signals.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/373681083","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17348#issuecomment-373681083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17348","id":373681083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MzY4MTA4Mw==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-16T11:05:50Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T11:05:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@elastic/es-search-aggs ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/393898598","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17348#issuecomment-393898598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17348","id":393898598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzg5ODU5OA==","user":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T14:30:54Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T14:30:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am closing this issue.
