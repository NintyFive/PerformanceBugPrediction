The index is correctly deleted from all nodes. When deleting a smaller index, it says \"acknowledged: true\".\nWhat is the semantics here? If it was due to a timeout, I'd expect a \"ProcessClusterEventTimeoutException\".\nAs a user, I'd be less confused if the API would be consistent, so I wouldn't go looking for stray data that was not deleted properly in case of a \"acknowledged: false\".\n\nExample:\n\n```\n~$ curl -XDELETE localhost:2500/small_index?pretty\n{\n  \"acknowledged\" : true\n}\n~$ curl -XDELETE localhost:2500/big_index?pretty\n{\n  \"acknowledged\" : false\n}\n```\n\nI'm running a clean install of ES 1.4.2.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
