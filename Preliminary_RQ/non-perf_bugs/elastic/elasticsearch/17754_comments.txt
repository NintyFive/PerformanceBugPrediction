Guice is **slowly** getting squashed out of Elasticsearch because it made it very hard to tell what was used where. It is being replaced by the deliberate \"this depends on this\" kind of behavior that you get from building things by hand.\n\nIf there is a thing that you need a reference to in a plugin and you can't get it then we can address that issue but the general direction that the code is going isn't an issue per say.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
