This involves configuring the client to use a Java Keystore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nKeyStore truststore = KeyStore.getInstance(\"jks\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, we don't provide guidance on how to actually build a Java Keystore. The `elasticsearch-certutil` docs [2] show users how to build a PKCS#12 keystore-- so if our example code snippet demonstrated how to use a `.p12` (in lieu of, or in addition to a `.jks`) things would align better.\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/_encrypted_communication.html\r\n[2] https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/configuring-tls.html\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
