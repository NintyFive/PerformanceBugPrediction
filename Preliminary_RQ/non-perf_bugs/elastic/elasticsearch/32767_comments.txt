The tests are completely bogus and would have never worked if the acking implementation had not been broken since its inception. The reason that the acking cannot work in this class is that it uses a publish timeout of 0, which means that cluster states can arrive out-of-order on nodes, which can in certain situations lead to cluster states being rejected as a better cluster state was already fully applied on the node. One way to work around the limitations in the test here might be to bring the cluster to a stable state first, and only then change the publish timeout for the one publishing round we want to check the acking for.\r\n\r\nIf there are more frequent failures of this, we can disable the whole class (AckIT) for now.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/413568084","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32767#issuecomment-413568084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32767","id":413568084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzU2ODA4NA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-16T14:36:55Z","updated_at":"2018-08-16T14:36:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I AwaitFix'ed this test.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/421036474","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32767#issuecomment-421036474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32767","id":421036474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTAzNjQ3NA==","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-13T14:54:15Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T14:54:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed in favour of #33673","performed_via_github_app":null}]
