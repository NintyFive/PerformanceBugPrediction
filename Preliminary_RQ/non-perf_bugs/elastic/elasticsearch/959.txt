The benefit of this cache is the fact that a configuration can be set to how much memory filter caching is allowed to take on the node level, regardless of the number fo shards allocated and no need to rely on \"soft\" caching from the VM.\n\nThe filter cache type is called `node`, and it has a single setting that _is not an index level setting_ but a node level settings (i.e. configure it in the elasticsearch.(ym;|json) file. The setting, named `indices.cache.filter.size` controls the size the filter cache will take on the node level. It can accept both a percentage parameter (for example, `25%`) and a strict byte size value (`3gb` for example). It defaults to `20%`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
