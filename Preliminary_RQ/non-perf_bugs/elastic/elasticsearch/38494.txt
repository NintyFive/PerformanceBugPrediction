Moreover, it is not clear from the [6.6 breaking changes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/breaking-changes-6.6.html#_changed_default_literal_geo_shape_literal_indexing_strategy) what needs to be done to make pre-6.6. shapes compatible with 6.6.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Create an index on a pre-6.6 ES containing a field of type `geo_shape`\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT test\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"doc\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"my_shape\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"geo_shape\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. index a shape\r\n```\r\nPUT test/doc/1\r\n{\r\n  \"my_shape\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"Polygon\",\r\n    \"coordinates\": [\r\n      [\r\n        [\r\n          -118.37326599344239,\r\n          34.082247752657956\r\n        ],\r\n        [\r\n          -118.37326637421617,\r\n          34.082384870862526\r\n        ],\r\n        [\r\n          -118.37369602509777,\r\n          34.08238389978479\r\n        ],\r\n        [\r\n          -118.37369564361956,\r\n          34.082246781581595\r\n        ],\r\n        [\r\n          -118.37326599344239,\r\n          34.082247752657956\r\n        ]\r\n      ]\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Find the shape using a `geo_shape` query\r\n```\r\nPOST test/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"geo_shape\": {\r\n      \"my_shape\": {\r\n        \"shape\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"point\",\r\n          \"coordinates\": [-118.37345570325851, 34.08231046148952]\r\n        },\r\n        \"relation\": \"contains\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Migrate to ES 6.6\r\n\r\n5. Run search from step 3 again and see that there is nothing being returned.","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
