We've traditionally done this sort of thing in a two phase process:\r\n1. Merge a PR that adds a deprecation warning to `getValues` to both 6.x and master.\r\n2. Merge a PR that drops the `getValues` entirely just to master.\r\n\r\nWe do this because it keeps 6.x as \"mostly backports of stuff in master\" and it allows us to always develop against master. So if you'd like to take this then step 1 is deprecating `getValues`.\r\n\r\nOne important thing: on `DeprecationLogger` there is a `deprecated` and a  `deprecatedAndMaybeLog` method. Use `deprecatedAndMaybeLog` because it'll be *much* faster. It is quite common for search scripts to run millions of times per request and the savings really adds up.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/425986011","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22919#issuecomment-425986011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22919","id":425986011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTk4NjAxMQ==","user":{"login":"j-haj","id":3361501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjE1MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3361501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj","html_url":"https://github.com/j-haj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-01T17:07:32Z","updated_at":"2018-10-01T17:07:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Perfect - I will get working on this and comment if I have any questions.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/426623719","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22919#issuecomment-426623719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22919","id":426623719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjYyMzcxOQ==","user":{"login":"j-haj","id":3361501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjE1MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3361501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj","html_url":"https://github.com/j-haj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-haj/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-03T12:44:13Z","updated_at":"2018-10-03T12:44:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nik9000 I have added a call to `deprecatedAndMaybeLog` to `ScriptDocValues#getValues`.
