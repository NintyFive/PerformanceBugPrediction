including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\nUsing Metricbeat's `elasticsearch` module with `xpack.enabled: true` and the built-in`remote_monitoring_user` to monitor the Elasticsearch instance gives HTTP/403 errors for the `enrich` [metricset](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-metricset-elasticsearch-enrich.html).\r\n\r\nIt seems the `monitor` privilege does not cover the `enrich stats` [API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/enrich-stats-api.html), and therefore the `remote_monitoring_collector` role fails too.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround one can create a custom role with the `manage_enrich` privilege, but of course this is way too permissive just for monitoring.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n```\r\n2020-01-30T14:55:24.941+0100\tINFO\tmodule/wrapper.go:252\tError fetching data for metricset elasticsearch.enrich: HTTP error 403 in : 403
