To have it as a flag, we have to add it as a parser option. Adding it as a parser option means it shows up in `bin/elasticsearch --help`. However, having it on help is a lie because our scripts now *always* pass the flag so users can not actually pass it as a flag or they'll duplicate the flag, a violation. So we moved it to a system property which is set from the environment variable.\r\n\r\nI don't see the problem with the environment variable being viral if we rename it sensibly to `ES_PATH_CONF` as I proposed elsewhere. In fact, it being viral has advantages: it means if you run any script (e.g., `elasticsearch-keystore`) then you have the right configuration. It would be better for users on the Unix-like systems to use export for the same reason. \r\n\r\nI think we should leave this as-is.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/322146622","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26158#issuecomment-322146622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26158","id":322146622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjE0NjYyMg==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-14T09:46:00Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T09:46:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think we should leave this as-is.\r\n\r\nagreed","performed_via_github_app":null}]
