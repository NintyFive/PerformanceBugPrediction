During the charm review process I was asked if there were published hashes for the elasticsearch tarball.  I was not able to find anything like that in the download area.  Specifically the reviewer said:\n\n\"charms that are part of the charmstore need to cryptographically\nverify downloads.  Can you please look to see if there're published\nhashes of the elasticsearch tarball that can be used?\"\n\nWould it be possible to provide that ?  It seems its a pre-requisite for charms that can be published in the juju charm store.\n\nAnother nice to have would be a way to download the latest version without knowing what the version number is, maybe with a symlinked /latest in the url. Otherwise it becomes quite a chore to update the default version number in the charm given the rapid release cycles practiced here.\n\nThanks!\nLuis \n","closed_by":{"login":"kaaloo","id":67010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/67010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaaloo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaaloo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaaloo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaaloo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaaloo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaaloo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaaloo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaaloo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaaloo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaaloo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaaloo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
