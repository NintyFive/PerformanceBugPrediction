Our logstash server is 10.100.1.10 and the openvpn server is 10.200.1.0/24 network. I am able to send test logs (logger test1, logger test2 etc.) from the remote hosts to our logstash server and I can see the logs I send in /var/log/syslog.Because of this, I can't seem to think it is a firewall issue at all. I am transferring the logs via UDP (. @ipaddress:514). The Logstash and syslog server are on the same host(10.100.1.10). Any hosts on the 10.100.1.0/24 network can send logs and Kibana displays them.\r\n\r\nTests: From remote host (10.200.1.10)\r\n\r\n\r\n` ping 10.100.1.10(logstash) => success`\r\n\r\n` netcat 10.100.1.10 -z -v -u 514 => success`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
