The field `role_mapping` object is queued but later ignored.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour seems to be similar to what we do for unknown fields or optional constructor args, but\r\nnot sure about it.","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
