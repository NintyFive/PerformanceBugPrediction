It's trivial to just say `new MatchNoneQueryBuilder()`, but that's a different _style_, which I find interferes with surrounding other code that just asks QueryBuilders.","closed_by":{"login":"m9aertner","id":6495291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6495291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m9aertner","html_url":"https://github.com/m9aertner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m9aertner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m9aertner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m9aertner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m9aertner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m9aertner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m9aertner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m9aertner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m9aertner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m9aertner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
