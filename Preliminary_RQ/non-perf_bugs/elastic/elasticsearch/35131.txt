At times this delay is too small and consequently, when the Datafeed pulls data from the index(es) data could be missed that has yet to be indexed.\r\n\r\nWe currently do a poor job of indicating if any data was missed and alerting the user to such. \r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nA proposed solution is for a separate process in real-time Datafeeds to look at past finalized bucket(s) and compare the `event_count` with a the current actual count of documents for that bucket(s) time window and the user provided query. \r\n\r\nTo capture bucket discrepancies over an arbitrary number of buckets in the past, a `date_histogram` aggregation with `interval=bucket_span`. When this is used in conjunction with the Datafeed's query it allows us to have an accurate count for what the `event_count` SHOULD be given the current data in the index. Then for each finalized bucket, we compare the `event_count` to the true data in the matching `date_histogram` bucket. If the true data has a higher count than the `event_count`, then that is considered a discrepancy.\r\n\r\nIf a discrepancy is found, an Audit should be made suggesting an increase in the query delay. As more capabilities are added (possibly [Annotations](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33376)?), those could be utilized to give a better indication of how much data was missed over a given timerange.
