However when we start a shard up we assume that everything that we find \"on disk\" has been properly `fsync()`ed, and this might not be true: if the shard was previously stopped because of a failed translog `fsync()` then the data we read might only reside in the page cache, and is at risk of vanishing if there is a subsequent power outage.\r\n\r\nIt should be sufficient to re-write (and `fsync()`) the translog checkpoint during recovery: we do not even write the checkpoint until the translog itself has been `fsync()`ed, so whatever checkpoint we read will validly refer to some durable portion of the translog, and the only question is whether it made it all the way to disk or not.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
