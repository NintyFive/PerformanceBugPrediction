I didn't see any website repo, and I don't think the docs repo is a good place.\n\nCould we create a section on elasticsearch.org to help us find and evaluate plugins? \n\nInfo on each plugin page:\n- Number of people using it. (Not sure how you'd get this data...)\n- Issue metadata\n  *\\* Could you pull in labels like \"Security\"? So you could see how many issues are feature request, or bugs, or whatever other labels are useful.\n- Comments/reviews\n- Rating/number of stars\n- A \"report this plugin\" form for use when a plugin is no longer developed but has major security issues. \n- List of similar plugins.\n\nAnd so on. Basically, a mashup of the kind of information found on galaxy.ansible.com and drupal.org's module pages.\n\nThis would:\n- Make it easier to find plugins\n- Help users evaluate the usefulness/trustworthyness of plugins\n- Help resolve issues like #664 where the main answer is to use a plugin, and people like me are resistent to using third-party plugins.\n","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
