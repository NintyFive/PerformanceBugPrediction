The consensus that we arrived at was that we don't want to make it any easier than absolutely necessary for blackhats to find exploitable code.  Even having whitehats commit patches makes it easy for blackhats.  We want to give our users as must chance to upgrade as possible before these exploits become public.\n\nFor this reason we won't publish links to the actual commits.  The affected versions are listed on https://www.elastic.co/community/security\n\nHonestly, we've fixed so many non-security related bugs since 1.0.3 that it would be a mistake for any user to continue to such an old version.\n\nHope you understand our stance\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/124060057","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12398#issuecomment-124060057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12398","id":124060057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDA2MDA1Nw==","user":{"login":"hillu","id":173211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzIxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/173211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hillu","html_url":"https://github.com/hillu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hillu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hillu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hillu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hillu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hillu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hillu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hillu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hillu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hillu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-23T11:11:03Z","updated_at":"2015-07-23T11:11:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry, I don't understand -- the point about blackhats having to invest a bit less time to find exploits seems a bit like a red hering to me -- and it is not far from Oracle-style \"advisories\" (\"Undisclosed vulnerability in component $FOO\").\n\nI'm afraid it's probably not going to possible to upgrade the Elasticsearch packages shipped with Debian/jessie to 1.6.1 or 1.7.0, so we'd very much like to fix the problems in the 1.0.3 codebase if they exist there.\n\nCouldn't you just tell me via private mail to bengen@debian.org how those CVE-worthy bugs were fixed?\n\nThanks,\n-Hilko\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
