They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nOne thing that baffles me is that, with wget, I *can* download:\n\nhttps://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/2.x/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-amd64/Packages\nhttps://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/2.x/debian/dists/stable/Release\nhttps://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/2.x/debian/dists/stable/Release.gpg\n\n(Incidentally, the last two failed, the last time I tried.)\n\nI also looked into “apt-key list” output, and your key was\nexplicitly listed there, so that’s also out. I guess we’ll\nhave to dig into APT debugging options…\n\nWith “apt-get -o Acquire::AllowWeakRepositories=true update”\nor “apt-get -o Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories=true update”\nI did not have any luck.\n\nWith “apt-get update -o Debug::Acquire::https=true” I hit luck:\n* error reading ca cert file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt (Error while reading file.)\nAnd indeed, something seems to have removed that file since its creation.\n\n----\n\nSo, while the “Release file does not exist (cannot be downloaded\nwith wget either)” problem actually occurred and is now fixed,\napparently, apt and wget use different SSL configurations. Huh.\n\nIncidentally, apt seems to use the same thing as cURL does, so\nperhaps asking people to try to retrieve the aforementioned file\nwith curl, explicitly not wget, may help in debugging.\n\nOK, thanks for fixing the missing Release file error and for your\npatience with tracking down the remaining issues. Feel free to\nclose this issue now (no idea if I can do it per eMail, and I only\nhave text mode interfaces right now).\n\nbye,\n//mirabilos\n-- \ntarent solutions GmbH\nRochusstraße 2-4, D-53123 Bonn • http://www.tarent.de/\nTel: +49 228 54881-393 • Fax: +49 228 54881-235\nHRB 5168 (AG Bonn) • USt-ID (VAT): DE122264941\nGeschäftsführer: Dr. Stefan Barth, Kai Ebenrett, Boris Esser, Alexander Steeg\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/403553617","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31799#issuecomment-403553617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31799","id":403553617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzU1MzYxNw==","user":{"login":"tomcallahan","id":15988488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTg4NDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15988488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan","html_url":"https://github.com/tomcallahan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T17:17:34Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T17:17:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great, thanks for the update and telling us how you debugged it, that'll help us out in the future.
