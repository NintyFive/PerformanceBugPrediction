This sounds like a good workaround, however it requires that you can change your data or ingesting new data, for existing/old data it requires a reindex. As long as you choose a reasonably sized value, I do not think you notice any performance or sizing problems.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/613767030","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55102#issuecomment-613767030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55102","id":613767030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzc2NzAzMA==","user":{"login":"gatling822","id":5474228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5474228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatling822","html_url":"https://github.com/gatling822","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatling822/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatling822/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatling822/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatling822/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatling822/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatling822/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatling822/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatling822/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatling822/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-15T01:43:09Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T01:43:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the help @hendrikmuhs \r\nOne last question is there some published roadmap for _transform API or Elastic in general?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/613868091","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55102#issuecomment-613868091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55102","id":613868091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzg2ODA5MQ==","user":{"login":"hendrikmuhs","id":7126422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7126422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrikmuhs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-15T07:30:59Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T07:30:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is no published roadmap, neither a private one. Why? Because that's not [how we work](https://github.com/elastic/engineering/blob/master/development_constitution.md). Elasticsearch does [time based releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often), therefore a new feature is not strictly tied to a release number.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean, that we have no plan, we actually strive for releasing a new feature in a certain version. However, the release train does not stop, if we miss it, we take the next one. We do not delay a release for a new feature, because there is always another one that seems _important_. We delay for quality and worst case we even revert a feature, if it does not meet the quality bar. That said, this is one of the reasons why we do not publish release dates upfront. However, if you work with the stack for some time, you notice, there is always something new within 2-3 months.\r\n\r\nLong story, short: We appreciate feedback, especially on rather new features like transform. Up-voting helps us to prioritize.\r\n\r\nThe best way to follow the development is using github. If you want to follow certain features, we have labels like `:ml/Transform`, with such a label as a search filter you get a better overview of what is been worked on. The same label is useful for `Pull requests`, to see what coming you can switch to the _closed_ PR's and apply the feature label _and_ a version label, e.g. `7.8.0`.\r\n\r\nIf you miss a certain feature, great, please open an issue, but please look for an existing one first. Feel free to add to the existing one, if it turns out that its not a duplicate, we will spawn a new issue from it. Again, the simplest form of feedback is an up-vote using the built-in github voting, this is welcome, too.\r\n\r\nUnsure, unclear, request for help? This is better placed on [discuss](https://discuss.elastic.co/).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
