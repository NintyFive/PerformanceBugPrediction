This change would have to be rewritten for the 6.x code, since there were drastic changes between the two branches. Additionally, it doesn't actually fix any bugs, so it doesn't meet our criteria for backporting.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this for now, but feel free to comment and we can always re-open it.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
