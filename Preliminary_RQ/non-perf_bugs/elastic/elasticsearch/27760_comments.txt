When I added the split API and I realized you should have a prime number if you wanna use it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Yet,  we had a ton of discussions internally what should be the default and there are multiple camps. Today since we have shard splitting I personally feel we should just go with 1 shard by default which is also a great starting point for capacity planning and scaling out. From 1 you can go to any number. I think we will make a call regarding the number of shards for ES 7 and I will update this issue once we did.
