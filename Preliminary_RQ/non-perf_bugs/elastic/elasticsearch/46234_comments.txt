This appears to be a user question, and we'd like to direct these kinds of things to the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/). If you can stop by there next time, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nI think the reason that `network.*` are not picked up here, is because you also specify *`.host` settings for the http and transport specifically. If `transport.bind_host` is not specified then it defaults to `network.bind_host` and if that isn't specified it defaults to `network.host`.\r\n\r\nThe way to look at this is, that `network.*host` settings are kind of a default for both transport and http. But in your case your have configured these settings for the transport and http components specifically and therefor `network.*` settings are not used.\r\n\r\nI think you should just use `network.host` for now and if you like the split binding across interfaces then you should also use `network.bind_host` setting. If you like that http and transport (for node to node communication) are split on different interfaces then you should just only use `transport.host*` and `transport.host*` settings.\r\n\r\nRelevant docs:\r\n* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/modules-network.html#advanced-network-settings\r\n* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/modules-transport.html#_transport_settings\r\n* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/modules-http.html#_settings","performed_via_github_app":null}]
