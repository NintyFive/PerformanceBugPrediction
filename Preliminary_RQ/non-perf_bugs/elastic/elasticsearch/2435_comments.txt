The only additional configuration option we need is what boolean operator to apply across strings.  For example, is 'foo', 'bar' translated into foo AND bar or foo OR bar.  We currently support configuring the operator used inside a string (so 'quick brown fox' becomes quick AND brown AND fox).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/10654148","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2435#issuecomment-10654148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2435","id":10654148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjU0MTQ4","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-11-23T09:35:06Z","updated_at":"2012-11-23T09:36:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm, I'm having second thoughts on this - wondering if it overcomplicates our default query and thus interferes with understanding.  It all seems fine when you're dealing with terms: \n\n```\n{ match: { tag: ['foo','bar','baz'] }}\n```\n\nBut the `terms` query also supports `minimum_should_match`, which in the `match` query is already used for rewriting analyzed queries.\n\nThen, how do you combine them? We could, as you suggest, just do a hardcoded `bool-should` clause with `minimum_should_match = 1` which will cover 90% of use cases. \n\nBut then somebody will open an issue asking us to support other execution plans and configurable minimums...  Do we want to go down that rabbit hole?\n\nDo we perhaps only enable the multi-query form for `not_analyzed` fields?  So you can't do:\n\n```\n{ match: { title: [ \"quick brown fox\", \"jumping jack rabbit\" ] }}\n```\n\nThat way we can reuse the `minimum_should_match` and `operator` parameters that already exist in the `match` query.\nOr is that just one more special case too many?\n\nThoughts?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/12327122","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2435#issuecomment-12327122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2435","id":12327122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzI3MTIy","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-16T16:37:19Z","updated_at":"2013-01-16T16:37:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks like this change was never committed, which I think was a good thing.
