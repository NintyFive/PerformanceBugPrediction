It might be valuable even if it only helps one or two of the workloads. I don't know enough about lucene internals to know whether or where GPUs would help.  But I'll speculate:\n\n1) - the paper mentioned indexing so that seems reasonable.  You have different documents that have to be tokenized, stemmed, etc.  The same, relatively simple work happening over and over again with relatively little interaction between them.\n2) merging indices - you have two indices and you need to merge them - index A for the word \"foo\" and Index B for \"foo\" need to be combined.  Likewise, the two indices for \"bar\" need to be merged, etc.\n3) I don't know how the aggregations work - seems like the parallelization might help.. different cores dealing with different elements of the agg but I'm not sure.\n4) could be searching also  - I have indices for \"the\", \"quick\", \"brown\" and \"fox\" which might reference millions of documents. I need to break those down to find which documents are in the majority of these terms - and include the tf/idf relationship.  Different cores might take a subset of the document/references and process it and then pass along the results.\n\nSo - these are just speculations based on my limited understanding of how Elasticsearch and Lucene work.  Just as Elasticsearch works by breaking down different lucene shards on different machines and bringing the results together - that may also work inside a machine with multiple cores instead of across machines.  \n\nthanks again for thinking about it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/229898040","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19148#issuecomment-229898040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19148","id":229898040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTg5ODA0MA==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T09:11:54Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T09:11:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is a too high hanging fruit even for labeling it that way.
