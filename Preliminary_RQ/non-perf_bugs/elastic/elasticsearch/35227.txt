The easiest way to do that is with a function_score query:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  function_score: {\r\n    query: {\r\n      some...query...\r\n    },\r\n    functions: [\r\n      {\r\n        gauss: {\r\n          created_at: { scale: '180d', offset: '1d', decay: 0.3 },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this query is merely a small piece of a much larger query that searches across multiple different content types across multiple indices, so I would like to filter my documents so that this query isn't performed on docs that don't match. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  function_score: {\r\n    query: {\r\n      some...query...\r\n    },\r\n    filter: {\r\n      only...if...filter...matches\r\n    }\r\n    functions: [\r\n      {\r\n        gauss: {\r\n          created_at: { scale: '180d', offset: '1d', decay: 0.3 },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes an error currently, because filter isn't an accepted keyword within a function_score query. So, instead, I'm ok duplicating the filter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  function_score: {\r\n    query: {\r\n      <some query with the following filter>\r\n      filter: { <some filter> }\r\n    },\r\n    functions: [\r\n      {\r\n        gauss: {\r\n          filter: { <same filter> },\r\n          created_at: { scale: '180d', offset: '1d', decay: 0.3 },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[parsing_exception] unknown field [created_at]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor documents that should be filtered out (they're in different indices with different schemas). Is this a bug? Is there any way to even use the function score filter when I want to nest it within other queries? I've tried wrapping the function score query within a bool query that filters out the docs I don't care about, and I can guarantee the the remaining docs will have a \"created_at\" field. I still get this parsing error when running those docs through the query.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a pretty big limitation for the function_score query when querying across multiple distinct indices.","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
