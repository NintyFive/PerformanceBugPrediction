These optionals were necessary because of flexibility we want to allow when parsing partial dates (skipping parts of the date like minutes, hour etc). You suggest to infer a format during ingestion and keep it in order to speed up parsing of future data.\r\nI am afraid that enhancement is not possible with current state of date parsing in elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nHowever I think you can easily work around by providing a custom date format when creating mapping which will not contain an optional part.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this would be sufficient.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/706917878","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57394#issuecomment-706917878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/57394","id":706917878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjkxNzg3OA==","user":{"login":"pgomulka","id":11137008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTM3MDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11137008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka","html_url":"https://github.com/pgomulka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-12T07:03:07Z","updated_at":"2020-10-12T07:03:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"closing as no feedback was provided","performed_via_github_app":null}]
