In the case of a storage account \"in\" US West, the secondary region is (always) US East.  To read from the secondary endpoint for the storage account one specifies a parameter LocationMode.SECONDARY_ONLY the APIs (in BlobRequestionOptions).  Access to the storage account through to the secondary endpoint is always READ ONLY.\n\nI have cases when I need to use different combinations of one storage account or the other and different values of LocationMode.  Given other patterns I have seen in ES, it seemed simplest to enable both multiple storage accounts to be specified in the yml file AND any combination of those storage accounts with the location mode at the time the repository is registered.\n\nI hope this helps to clarify the feature I built.\n\nCraig.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/136483083","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12759#issuecomment-136483083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12759","id":136483083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjQ4MzA4Mw==","user":{"login":"craigwi","id":6687101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODcxMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6687101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigwi","html_url":"https://github.com/craigwi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigwi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigwi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigwi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigwi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigwi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigwi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigwi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigwi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigwi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-31T19:57:44Z","updated_at":"2015-08-31T19:57:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I created a pull request https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/13228 containing the changes I had made to the elasticsearch-cloud-azure plugin.\n\nCraig.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/165784698","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12759#issuecomment-165784698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12759","id":165784698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTc4NDY5OA==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-18T14:02:30Z","updated_at":"2015-12-18T14:02:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This has been fixed by #13779\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
