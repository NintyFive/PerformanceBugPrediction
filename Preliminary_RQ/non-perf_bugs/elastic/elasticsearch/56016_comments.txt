For instance you're missing the fact that this phase is executed in the network thread directly and avoids the search thread pool queue. \r\nWe don't have any plans to remove this phase and are actively adding more features on top of it (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/49092). So, since you mentioned that this phase doesn't slow down fast queries, I hope you don't mind if I close this issue. However I'd be happy to continue the discussion in the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch/6), which is better suited for this kind of conversation.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
