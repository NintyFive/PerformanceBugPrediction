We should look at what needs to be done to support them in Elasticsearch.\n\nI propose adding `big_integer` and `big_decimal` types which have to be specified explicitly - they shouldn't be a type which can be detected by dynamic mapping.\n\nMany languages don't support big int/decimal. Javascript will convert to floats or throw an exception if a number is out of range.  This can be worked around by always rendering these numbers in JSON as strings. We can possibly accept known bigints/bigdecimals as numbers but there are a few places where this could be a problem:\n- indexing a known big field (do we know ahead of time to parse a floating point as a BigDecimal?)\n- dynamic mapping (a floating point number could have lost precision before the field is defined as big_decimal)\n- ingest pipeline (ingest doesn't know about field mappings)\n\nThe above could be worked around by [telling Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/wiki/Deserialization-Features) to parse floats and ints as BIG\\* (`USE_BIG_DECIMAL_FOR_FLOATS` and `USE_BIG_INTEGER_FOR_INTS`) but this may well generate a lot of garbage for what is an infrequent use case.\n\nAlternatively, we could just say that Big\\* should always be passed in as strings if they are to maintain their precision.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
