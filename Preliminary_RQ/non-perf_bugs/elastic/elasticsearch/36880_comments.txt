If you are only using the synonyms at query-time to expand search terms then a workaround might be to set up only one index with the synonym analyzer and call the `_analyze` api to pre-process your query strings in your client application to expand the search terms. This would mean you'd have only one copy of the synonym file loaded but would have to do extra work in your client app to prepare queries.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/449236987","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36880#issuecomment-449236987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36880","id":449236987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTIzNjk4Nw==","user":{"login":"ikingme","id":27466250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDY2MjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/27466250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikingme","html_url":"https://github.com/ikingme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikingme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikingme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikingme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikingme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikingme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikingme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikingme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikingme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikingme/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-21T04:00:27Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T04:00:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much for patient explanations and good suggestion!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
