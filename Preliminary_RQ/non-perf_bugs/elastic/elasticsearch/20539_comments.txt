I've tried so many different suggestions across the net (which is a testament to how bad and poorly organized the elasticsearch documentation is). I'm in such a bad spot right now, I'm almost ready to find a different search indexing tool. I'm trying to debug some bad behavior on my production machines and would like to look at my log stashes to see what's happening, but alas, I'm stuck trying to debug how I can gain access to those logs. I'm going to open a separate issue on complete lockout in Kibana if the FREE licenses expire. Nag me to renew - but don't lock me out. This is rediculous.

The exact issue that was reported here was caused by a bug in a pre-release version of Elasticsearch 5.0.0, the problem does not exist in any production release of Elasticsearch. If you're running into an issue with the same symptoms, it is a different problem.
