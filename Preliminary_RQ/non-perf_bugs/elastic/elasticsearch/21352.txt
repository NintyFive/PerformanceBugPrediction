See http://site.icu-project.org/download.\r\n\r\nAs updating ICU require a re-indexation, I'm wondering what is the path for power user who wants to benefits from the latest CLDR / Unicode features? I understand that updating Elasticsearch should not require a re-index operation, so I guess I should build my own icu-analysis plugin maybe?\r\nThe [Lucene ICU components](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.lucene/lucene-analyzers-icu/6.2.1) are also not up to date with ICU as they requires the version 56.1 instead of 58.1.\r\n\r\nAs this plugin depend on a library that is very often updated, maybe it's not the best choice to ship it with Elasticsearch directly? As an external plugin, it could follow the ICU versions without blocking cluster updates for users.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDamien","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
