Having seen nothing but the user interface I have no idea how this is actually implemented, but I could imagine systems like these to have some logic in the application that tries to identify user queries/ search intents that look like article numbers and use a different template for retrieving results for that from the index compared to the template used for all other queries.\r\n\r\nThe only way to come up with an estimate answer to the question \"Given a random user comes to our \r\nsite, how well does our search perform?\" is to sample a mix of both, queries for article numbers and free text queries. Being able to represent those as two templates in the rank eval request should make it easier to play around with how these queries are being translated to actual Elasticsearch queries.\r\n\r\nMakes any sense at all?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/263905446","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21257#issuecomment-263905446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21257","id":263905446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzkwNTQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-30T15:39:01Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T15:39:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/267949025","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21257#issuecomment-267949025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21257","id":267949025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzk0OTAyNQ==","user":{"login":"MaineC","id":70953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/70953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC","html_url":"https://github.com/MaineC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaineC/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-19T12:06:38Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T12:06:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Resolved with #22139 ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
