using option --default.path.data at startup and configuring path.data with a different path in /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml, indices are correctly stored in the path defined in elasticsearch.yml, but translogs are still stored in the path defined by --default.path.data.\n\nRemoving --default.path.data solves the problem, but when using packages for ES, it involves modifying /etc/init.d/elasticsearch, which is a packaged file.\n\nThis situation is a problem, because in my case the default data path (/var/lib/elasticsearch) is a small partition while data paths i configured in elasticsearch.yml are a group of huge SSD. I think translogs should be stored in the correct data.path in order to efficiently use available storage.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
