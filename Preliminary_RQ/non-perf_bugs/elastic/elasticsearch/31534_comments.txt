Stack overflows, like out-of-memory errors, are hard to deal with because they can happen on pretty-much every line of code, making it very hard to guarantee consistency of data-structures. It might be ok to catch stack-overflows if there are no side-effects, but we would like to avoid doing this as the absence of side-effect is an invariant that cannot be enforced, so we are not protected from a future refactoring to introduce side-effects that would make catching stack overflows unsafe.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence I'm closing this issue, we will need to deal with the potential sources of stack overflows one by one and fix them. This is going to be unpleasant for users that discover these stack overflows but we don't have a better option.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
