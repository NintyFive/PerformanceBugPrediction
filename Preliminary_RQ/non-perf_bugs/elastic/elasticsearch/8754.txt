However, if `$DATA_DIR` has a comma in it (indicating the user wants to locate indexes over multiple directories), the script uses the literal value of the variable as the name of the directory to manipulate instead of splitting them at the comma symbol. \n\nFor example, if `$DATA_DIR` is `\"/mnt/data1,/mnt/data2\"`, then the script will try to create and set the ownership of a directory called  `\"/mnt/data1,/mnt/data2\"` instead of `/mnt/data1` and `/mnt/data2` separately.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
