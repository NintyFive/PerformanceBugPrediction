Therefore, even when two keys have exactly the same set of role descriptors, their roles must be calculated separately and also counted as two independant cache item. In addition, a single key's role descriptors and and limiting role descriptors are also cached seperately. This means we need at least 2 caching slots for every API key. \r\n\r\nWhen there is a large amount of API keys, we could face a role cache thrashing problem. The default cache size is 10k so that 5k keys will be able to saturate it. If any of the role descriptor includes a non-empty application privilege, it could further saturate the [search thread pool](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.6/x-pack/plugin/security/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/security/authz/store/CompositeRolesStore.java#L419), which in turns leads to an overloaded cluster. \r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to assume that most of the 5k keys share the same privilege definitions. Hence the caching problem can be improved if a Role built from the same set of role descriptors can be re-used. That is, despite different API key IDs and possibly different role descriptor names, if the content of a set of role descriptors are the same, we should be able to cach and re-use it.","closed_by":{"login":"ywangd","id":2344308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDQzMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2344308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd","html_url":"https://github.com/ywangd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
