This location (or one of its parent directories) must be registered in the path.repo setting on all master and data nodes.\r\nAssuming that the shared filesystem is mounted to /mount/backups/my_backup, the following setting should be added to elasticsearch.yml file:\"\r\n\r\n`path.repo: [\"/mount/backups\", \"/mount/longterm_backups\"]`\r\n\r\nAnd again here.  It looks like maybe `my_backup` was changed to `my_fs_backup` but I don't know snapshots very well so I could me misinterpreting it.\r\n\r\n\"After all nodes are restarted, the following command can be used to register the shared file system repository with the name my_backup:\"\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT /_snapshot/my_fs_backup\r\n{\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then a few more examples alternate between `my_backup` and `my_fs_backup`;\r\n\r\nGET /_snapshot/my_backup/_current\r\nDELETE /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_2\r\nDELETE /_snapshot/`my_fs_backup`\r\nPOST /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1/_restore\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
