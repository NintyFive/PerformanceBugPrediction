I think this might not yet be working in 6.2 but I just checked in master and the soon-to-be-released 6.3 branch and alias resolution should work as expected there. However I should point out that in the `ratings` section of the request the documents are identified by their real index/id pair, not the index alias. I just added a few test to the master branch that should verify that aliases are working and will close this once those tests are merged.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
