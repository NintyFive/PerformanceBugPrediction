If the node is not connected, it will not get cluster state updates from the master. Originally we had this reconnect to deal with environments that sometimes close connections but the network weren't down. However, it turned out to be an issue in the cases where a network issue causes timeouts, in which case we just waited on the timeout to fire and the transport to disconnect and then we retried and waited for another timeout period, during which the node will not get any updates. This is why we changed it.\n\nAs a side note - if this happens, the node will ping for and rejoin the master, making sure it has the latest cluster state.\n\nI'm wondering - why did you need this? I assume something didn't work well for you.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/162244517","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10206#issuecomment-162244517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10206","id":162244517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjI0NDUxNw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-05T20:49:40Z","updated_at":"2015-12-05T20:49:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No more feedback.
