The `filter` object in the search request is the deprecated name for the [`post_filter`](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_filtering_queries_and_aggregations.html#_post_filter), which allow you to filter the documents returned in the `hits` part of the response without affecting the documents used in the aggregations. \n\nIf you are wanting to use a filter to affect both the hits and aggregations then you should use the 'filtered query' as you have in one of your working examples above.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
