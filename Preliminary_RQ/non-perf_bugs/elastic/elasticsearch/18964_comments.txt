With 3 shard copies it requires 2 of them to be present before allocating the copy with the highest version as primary (see also https://discuss.elastic.co/t/index-recovery-initial-shards/5999/2 ). It is essentially a safeguard that tries to ensure that a stale shard copy does not become primary, resulting in data loss. It is not perfectly safe (see #14671), and we have taken steps in v5.0.0 to make this setting obsolete (The system now tracks non-stale copies, see #14739).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
