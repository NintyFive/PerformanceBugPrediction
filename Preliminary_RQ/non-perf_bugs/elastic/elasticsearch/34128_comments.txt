Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/425417122","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34128#issuecomment-425417122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34128","id":425417122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTQxNzEyMg==","user":{"login":"sebasdigital","id":43659129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjU5MTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/43659129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebasdigital","html_url":"https://github.com/sebasdigital","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebasdigital/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebasdigital/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebasdigital/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebasdigital/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebasdigital/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebasdigital/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebasdigital/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebasdigital/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebasdigital/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T12:17:07Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T12:17:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @cbuescher for your help and guidance and apologies for the mistake.
