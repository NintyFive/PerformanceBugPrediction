a handful of existing rules < 10 leverage this functionality.

I think it's okay to close the issue or de-scope it.\r\n\r\nThere are some (ugly) workarounds if users want to leverage field <--> field comparisons. Put this expression within a function that can only be evaluated in painless, then that code will never be reached.
