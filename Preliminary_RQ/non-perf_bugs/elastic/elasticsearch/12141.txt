But it appears that when we added this back, we haven't gone back and updated the documentation to re-add the information on disabling _source and the includes/excludes usage.  So the latest doc in master is missing this information:  \n\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/mapping-source-field.html#include-exclude (doc in master)\n\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commits/d32a80f37b1e09d37b1556ba5cce74d0b76bb8c4/docs/reference/mapping/fields/source-field.asciidoc (history of doc changes)\n\nThis is a request to add back the documentation on disabling source and the caveats mentioned here (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11116#issuecomment-101320891) now that the feature has returned.  And since the feature is back, I think it also means that includes/excludes is no longer \"deprecated\"?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
