From #13404, it seems that there are no plans to make it optional.\n\nHowever, I fail to see how it is possible to write tests using ESIntegTestCase in complex environment with the jar hell check enabled. In production I am usually deploying an uber jar, so everything works fine, since only one instance of a class goes in the flattened jar.\n\nBut when running tests from maven, there isn't much I can do to avoid the jar hell, because the duplicated classes are in the dependency jars and the classloader is deciding at runtime which class to pick (as maven shade, which I use to build the uber jar, has decided offline). It seems that others in stackoverflow are having the same problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33975807/elasticsearch-jar-hell-error.\n\nI used maven duplicate finder plugin to take a deep look in my duplicated jars to see what I could do, and although I could get rid of many of them, there are still some that seem impossible to fix. See below just for a glimpse of the problem:\n\n```\nmvn clean duplicate-finder:check\n...\n[WARNING] Found duplicate and different classes in [au.com.bytecode:opencsv:2.4, net.sf.opencsv:opencsv:2.3]:\n[WARNING]   au.com.bytecode.opencsv.CSVReader\n[WARNING]   au.com.bytecode.opencsv.CSVWriter\n[WARNING]   au.com.bytecode.opencsv.bean.HeaderColumnNameTranslateMappingStrategy\n[WARNING] Found duplicate and different classes in [com.google.guava:guava:18.0, org.apache.spark:spark-network-common_2.10:1.6.0]:\n[WARNING]   com.google.common.base.Absent\n[WARNING]   com.google.common.base.Function\n[WARNING]   com.google.common.base.Optional\n[WARNING]   com.google.common.base.Present\n[WARNING]   com.google.common.base.Supplier\n...\n```\n\nUnfortunately, the reality is that upstream dependencies can be packaged in some crazy ways (sometimes for good reasons, sometimes not), and as far as I know, when in maven or intellij, different from deploy jars where I can use maven-shade or others, there isn't an \"offline\" way for me to tell the system how to get rid of the jar hell. \n\nAfter struggling this for quite some time now, the only way I out I see is to keep my own locally hacked elasticsearch, which is a solution I really don't like. Any other suggestions on how to work around this? \n\nIf there is a true solution, I will be happy to hear, but right now I have 45 dependencies contributing to the jar hell, and I have no idea how to fix them.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/167744228","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14348#issuecomment-167744228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14348","id":167744228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Nzc0NDIyOA==","user":{"login":"jprante","id":635745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTc0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/635745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante","html_url":"https://github.com/jprante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-29T08:27:59Z","updated_at":"2015-12-29T08:29:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bonitao I think you should take one step back and take a fresh breath. Wow, ES gives you the opportunity to clean up the dependencies of your project.\n\nAre you authoring a plugin? Or do you just need an embedded ES client?\n\nBeside wrestling with Maven, you could use Gradle for your project. There is a learning curve but the classpath configuration abilities are more flexible than in Maven. The ES team is switching to Gradle (again) because Maven is not flexible enough.\n\nFor an example, see my integration test at https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-langdetect/blob/master/build.gradle which can test plugin loading- it does not require the ES test framework.\n\nBefore thinking about a \"hacked\" Elasticsearch (which is a good thing), you could also try to just change the Elasticsearch build. From above it seems Google Guava has conflict with Spark. So it may be an alternative to shadow dependencides, either in your project, or in Spark, or in Elasticsearch.

But it did not work out, and I do not believe it will. Let me try to explain why.\n\nI am not authoring a plugin. I am building a restful service that has an embedded ES client and an extract/load/transform pipeline, which also talks with ES. The code does a bunch of things, like doing search queries, doing snapshot/restores through the admin api, and doing bulk indexing with elasticsearch-hadoop-mr. This all works with ES 1.7.x, and from what I have seen, it also works in ES 2.x after I build an uber jar. The only thing that fails are my unit tests in ES 2.x, because in the test environment my classpath is built from the individual dependency jars.\n\nThe code is built with maven, but I also have a SBT setup for it. I have a passing knowledge of gradle, but as I understand, none of these tools really support the idea of creating a test classpath by unzipping and manipulating dependencies jars. Yes, they all have tricks like the one you did in https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-langdetect/blob/master/build.gradle#L121 to remove full jars from the classpath, but not for manipulating the contents of the individual classpaths for tests.\n\nIt is of course possible, after all, both the maven shade plugin and the gradle shadow plugin you linked, solve that exact problem.  But these are tied to the release steps of the build, and as far as I know, there is not a natural way to run my unit tests with a classpath pointing solely to an uber jar. So, all the jar hell check is buying is forcing me into moving my unit tests into integration tests, and forcing the integration tests to work out of the flat jar (which I still need to figure out how to do).\n\nAs for fixing the jar hell in the dependencies, it is just not possible. I have already fixed many simple cases, like common-beanutils and netty, which is brought as a uber jar and individual deps in my build, and for smaller libraries, I have worked on upstream fixes to their pom, but I still have dozens of conflicts (all easily seen with duplicate finder), and some  are really beyond my league. I would love to see anyone that has been able to run unit tests with ES 2.x and spark together. Direct shadowing is of no help here, because the libraries are being used directly in the tests. I would need to shadow guava within spark, and depend on the resulting jar instead of the original spark libraries. \n\nAnd the spark issue is just one of many. For example, hadoop has some fake conflicts with itself: \n\n```\n[WARNING] Found duplicate and different classes in [org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-client:2.7.1, org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-common:2.7.1]:\n[WARNING]   org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.api.impl.package-info\n[WARNING]   org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.api.package-info\n[WARNING] Found duplicate and different classes in [org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-api:2.7.1, org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-common:2.7.1]:\n[WARNING]   org.apache.hadoop.yarn.factories.package-info\n[WARNING]   org.apache.hadoop.yarn.factory.providers.package-info\n[WARNING]   org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util.package-info\n[\n```\n\nAnd so does spark: \n\n```\n[WARNING] Found duplicate and different classes in [org.apache.spark:spark-catalyst_2.10:1.5.0, org.apache.spark:spark-core_2.10:1.5.0, org.apache.spark:spark-graphx_2.10:1.5.0, org.apache.spark:spark-launcher_2.10:1.5.0, org.apache.spark:spark-mllib_2.10:1.5.0, org.apache.spark:spark-network-common_2.10:1.5.0, org.apache.spark:spark-network-shuffle_2.10:1.5.0, org.apache.spark:spark-repl_2.10:1.5.0, org.apache.spark:spark-sql_2.10:1.5.0, org.apache.spark:spark-streaming_2.10:1.5.0, org.apache.spark:spark-unsafe_2.10:1.5.0, org.spark-project.spark:unused:1.0.0]:\n[WARNING]   org.apache.spark.unused.UnusedStubClass\n```\n\nAnd scala-lang bundles stuff it probably shouldn't:\n\n```\n[WARNING] Found duplicate and different classes in [org.fusesource.jansi:jansi:1.4, org.scala-lang:jline:2.10.4]:\n[WARNING]   org.fusesource.jansi.Ansi\n[WARNING]   org.fusesource.jansi.AnsiConsole\n[\n```\n\nAnd my dependencies bring conflicting opencsv versions:\n\n```\n[WARNING] Found duplicate and different classes in [au.com.bytecode:opencsv:2.4, net.sf.opencsv:opencsv:2.3]:\n[WARNING]   au.com.bytecode.opencsv.CSVReader\n[WARNING]   au.com.bytecode.opencsv.CSVWriter\n[WARNING]   au.com.bytecode.opencsv.bean.HeaderColumnNameTranslateMappingStrategy\n```\n\nSo, I will need to solve each one of those to be able to run elasticsearch tests, even though I already have a solution for production, through the creation of uber jar. So, all I really need is a flag to disable the jar hell check in unit tests. With that flag, I could even choose to run the tests again in the integration phase with the flattened jar, but that is later in the development cycle, and slower.\n\nI hope that exposition of the problem helps. ES is a great product, and I will definitively hack the source to get my tests to run if needed, but it seems to me that many people will face similar issues, and it would be best to leave a system property toggle for when fixing the jar hell is not feasible. Again, in production there is nothing to fix if you are running a flattened jar (damage is already done), and if I understand it right, people not running tests won't even hit the check. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/167782110","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14348#issuecomment-167782110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14348","id":167782110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Nzc4MjExMA==","user":{"login":"jprante","id":635745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTc0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/635745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante","html_url":"https://github.com/jprante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-29T12:44:39Z","updated_at":"2015-12-29T12:44:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bonitao I know this is the wrong place to discuss further because it may be going off-topic.

I have tests working but they relied on a local instance of ES running which is not ideal as I'd need to ensure the tests run on integration servers or other peoples machines. Our code is not so easy to clean as there are several conflicts that JarHell detects which are beyond my control, e.g. sl4j in dependent libraries.
