That said, I didn't execute these requests with curl, but I reproduced them using both Python's requests module and the Sense app for Chrome. Also the request did in fact work when the POST was made to `_mapping`, but it's still not clear to me why the ES instance should behave differently when I define index settings.\n\nTo recap:\nWhen I define the settings for an index I CANNOT create a mapping by posting directly to the type\nWhen I do not define the settings for an index I CAN create a mapping by posting directly to the type \n\nThis behaviour still baffles me, but as there is a workaround for this strange behaviour I'm going to close this issue, might ask a related question on other more appropriate forums.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
