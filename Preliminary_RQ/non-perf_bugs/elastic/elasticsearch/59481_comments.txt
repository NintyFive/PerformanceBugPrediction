Creating API keys always require a name to be specified. However, when grant API key action is added, this requirement is missed out. We plan to fix it in a future release (post v7.9). For backwards compatibility, we will continue to support API keys without names internally. But the API will be updated so that the API key name is mandatory for granting API keys. Please note Kibana's usage of granting API keys needs to be updated when #59484 is fixed. Thanks!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
