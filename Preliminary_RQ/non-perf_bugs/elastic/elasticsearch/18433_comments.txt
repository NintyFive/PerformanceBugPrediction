So `nodes` is written only if `nodes.ABC.discovery` exists. So I ran a node and checks the ouput of `GET /_nodes/stats` and saw that Discovery stats were located in `nodes.ABC.fs.discovery` meaning that something messed up the object hierarchy.\n\nI think we could detect malformed objects built with `XContentBuilder` and throws an exception. I'll try to have a look at this.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
