I tried the above reproduction steps on macOS: it didn't reproduce and `comment/_mapping` was created correctly.\r\n\r\nIn fact seeing the error looks as if the application somehow tries to use [types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/removal-of-types.html) so I'd double check the tool is the same version on all platforms.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, we'd like to direct these kinds of things to the [Elasticsearch forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch). If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
