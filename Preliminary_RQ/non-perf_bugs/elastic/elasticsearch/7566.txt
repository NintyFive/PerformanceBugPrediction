#7238 it looked like index corruption (checksum errors) but in fact it was simply that the user selected bloom_pulsing postings format, which we don't support yet still allow.\n\nWe recently removed documentation showing these postings format as a choice, but it's still really dangerous we allow this option at all since it creates unusable indices in ES when we migrate shards and try to check integrity.  Before 1.3, ES didn't check Lucene checksums, so these postings formats worked fine, but with 1.3 any index using pulsing will fail.\n\nThe pulsing optimization has already been folded into the default postings format for quite a while now.\n\nI think we should remove them; we are already removing pulsing from Lucene (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5915)\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikemccand","id":796508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/796508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemccand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
