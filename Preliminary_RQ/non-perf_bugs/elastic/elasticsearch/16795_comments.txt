I always get the index name back on both java api and REST layer, which is the expected behaviour as aliases get resolved to concrete indices as part of api execution. It is expected that with the java api the lookup for the alias in the map fails, better to iterate over the map entries instead. Can you double check your REST api output and post any output that may contain the alias name in it rather than the index name?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/188655695","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16795#issuecomment-188655695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16795","id":188655695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODY1NTY5NQ==","user":{"login":"AndreVirtimo","id":11404063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDA0MDYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11404063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreVirtimo","html_url":"https://github.com/AndreVirtimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreVirtimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreVirtimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreVirtimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreVirtimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreVirtimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreVirtimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreVirtimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreVirtimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreVirtimo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T07:40:47Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T07:40:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey @javanna , I'm sorry.
