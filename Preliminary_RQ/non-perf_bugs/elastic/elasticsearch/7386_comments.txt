I have a theory. Indeed the cluster name as part of the _cluster state_ was introduced in 1.1.1 . When a node of version >=1.1.1 reads the cluster state from an older node, that field will be populated with null. During the upgrade from 1.1.0 this happened and the cluster state in memory has it's name set to null. Since you never restarted the complete cluster since then, all nodes have kept communicating it keep it alive. This trips this new code. A full cluster restart should fix it but that's obviously totally not desirable. I'm still trying to come up with a potential work around... \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/53110831","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7386#issuecomment-53110831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7386","id":53110831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTEwODMx","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-22T19:40:12Z","updated_at":"2014-08-22T19:40:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nik9000 do you use dedicated master nodes? it doesn't look so from the logs but I want to double check\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/53111137","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7386#issuecomment-53111137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7386","id":53111137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTExMTM3","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-22T19:42:46Z","updated_at":"2014-08-22T19:42:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bleskes no dedicated master nodes.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/53111276","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7386#issuecomment-53111276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7386","id":53111276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTExMjc2","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-22T19:44:02Z","updated_at":"2014-08-22T19:44:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bleskes that's what I was thinking - I was digging through places where the cluster state is built from name and they are pretty rare.
