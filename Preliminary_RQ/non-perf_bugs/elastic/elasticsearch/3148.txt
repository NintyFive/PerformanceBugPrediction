am seeing this issue in 0.90.1 and 0.20.5 (I have not tested on any release in between or before 0.20.5).\n\nFirst, I create an index called `test`.\n\nThen I insert 2 documents:\n\n``` json\nPOST http://localhost:9200/test/people/1\n\n{\n    \"user\": \"Anna Citizen\",\n    \"post_date\": \"2009-11-15T14:12:12\",\n    \"message\": \"ES is great!\"\n}\n```\n\n``` json\nPOST http://localhost:9200/test/people/2\n\n{\n    \"user\": \"Jerry Smith\",\n    \"post_date\": \"2009-11-15T14:12:12\",\n    \"message\": \"Testing ES!\"\n}\n```\n\nThen I run a simple `match_phrase_prefix` query:\n\n``` json\nPOST http://localhost:9200/test/_search/\n\n{\n   \"query\":{\n      \"match\":{\n         \"people.user\":{\n            \"type\":\"phrase_prefix\",\n            \"query\":\"j\"\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThe correctly finds the `Jerry Smith` document:\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"took\":2,\n   \"timed_out\":false,\n   \"_shards\":{\n      \"total\":5,\n      \"successful\":5,\n      \"failed\":0\n   },\n   \"hits\":{\n      \"total\":1,\n      \"max_score\":0.19178301,\n      \"hits\":[\n         {\n            \"_index\":\"test\",\n            \"_type\":\"people\",\n            \"_id\":\"2\",\n            \"_score\":0.19178301,\n            \"_source\":{\n               \"user\":\"Jerry Smith\",\n               \"post_date\":\"2009-11-15T14:12:12\",\n               \"message\":\"ES is great!\"\n            }\n         }\n      ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if I search for `a`, I get nothing:\n\n``` json\nPOST http://localhost:9200/test/_search/\n\n{\n   \"query\":{\n      \"match\":{\n         \"people.user\":{\n            \"type\":\"phrase_prefix\",\n            \"query\":\"a\"\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"took\":1,\n   \"timed_out\":false,\n   \"_shards\":{\n      \"total\":5,\n      \"successful\":5,\n      \"failed\":0\n   },\n   \"hits\":{\n      \"total\":0,\n      \"max_score\":null,\n      \"hits\":[\n\n      ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThe only way to get the `Anna Citizen` document is to search for `ann`:\n\n``` json\nPOST http://localhost:9200/test/_search/\n\n{\n   \"query\":{\n      \"match\":{\n         \"people.user\":{\n            \"type\":\"phrase_prefix\",\n            \"query\":\"ann\"\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"took\":1,\n   \"timed_out\":false,\n   \"_shards\":{\n      \"total\":5,\n      \"successful\":5,\n      \"failed\":0\n   },\n   \"hits\":{\n      \"total\":1,\n      \"max_score\":0.19178301,\n      \"hits\":[\n         {\n            \"_index\":\"test\",\n            \"_type\":\"people\",\n            \"_id\":\"1\",\n            \"_score\":0.19178301,\n            \"_source\":{\n               \"user\":\"Anna Citizen\",\n               \"post_date\":\"2009-11-15T14:12:12\",\n               \"message\":\"trying out Elastic Search\"\n            }\n         }\n      ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nWhy is this happening? Could this possibly be a bug?\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
