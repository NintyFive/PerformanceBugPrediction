we have moved to secure settings for S3 and removed/deprecated some settings like `region`, we must update the documentation.\r\n\r\nI'm just adding this issue so we don't forget to do it.\r\n\r\nSome users are yet hitting this:\r\n\r\n* https://discuss.elastic.co/t/s3-repository-deprecated-settings-warning/92354\r\n* https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elasticsearch-yml-chanages-2-x-to-5-x-on-aws-ec2-amazon-linux/88041/6\r\n* https://discuss.elastic.co/t/getting-aws-credentials-from-keystore-for-discovery-ec2-plugin/87958/5\r\n\r\nI'm summarizing here major changes so if anyone in the meantime is hitting this, we can refer them to this issue:\r\n\r\n# Using secure settings\r\n\r\nYou now need to register the following secured settings (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/secure-settings.html):\r\n\r\n## For EC2\r\n\r\n* `discovery.ec2.access_key`\r\n* `discovery.ec2.secret_key`\r\n\r\n## For S3\r\n\r\n* `s3.client.default.access_key`\r\n* `s3.client.default.secret_key`\r\n\r\n# region is replaced by endpoint\r\n\r\nAnd `cloud.aws.region` should not be used anymore.\r\n\r\n## For EC2\r\n\r\n`discovery.ec2.endpoint` needs to be set in `elasticsearch.yml` file. Pick your endpoint from this list: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region\r\n\r\n## For S3\r\n\r\n`s3.client.default.endpoint` needs to be set in `elasticsearch.yml` file. Pick your endpoint from this list: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
