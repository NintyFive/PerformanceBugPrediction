We should make it easier, by warning or even throwing an exception.\n\nThis can be controlled by the `deprecations` setting which accepts:\n- `warn` - logs and returns a warning in the request body when deprecated syntax/functionality/end points  are used\n- `error` - throw an exception when deprecated syntax/functionality/end points are used\n- `ignore` - silently ignore deprecations\n\nThe default setting should be `warn`, to inform users during development of problems with their code.  The user can set it to `error` to be sure that they are catching all problems, and they can set it to `ignore` in production so that known usage of deprecated functionality does not obscure real problems.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
