The error you see is part of the \"upgrade\" process when starting a node. Moving them to another location should have allowed you to still open them with a 1.7 cluster. Also, this is why it is highly recommended to backup your data with a snapshot before upgrading.\n\n> the migration plugin should at least mark that as RED / Critical error.\n\n@clintongormley That seems like an easy fix? This blue warning you got is not actually the error here. This is because of a more recent change which does not allow a field to be an \"object\" as well as a regular field at the same time. For example, if in your mappings you had a field underneath `_source`, then _source would become an object field.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/183728878","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16576#issuecomment-183728878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16576","id":183728878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MzcyODg3OA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-13T19:17:32Z","updated_at":"2016-02-13T19:17:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rjernst fixed in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-migration/commit/0d6dce8dcd58b15201fbcd3206ca33eba1558a12\n\nClosing this issue as i don't think there is any more to do here\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
