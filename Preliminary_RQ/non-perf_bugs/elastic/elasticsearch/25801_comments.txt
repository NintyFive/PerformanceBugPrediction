For example, it could be a simple case of a non-parameterized script so you are repeatedly compiling new scripts, a known source of leaks. Yet, we use GitHub as an issue tracker, not for general help. For that, we use the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co). We can reopen this issue if there is a verified bug.\r\n\r\nAlso, the lifecycle of 2.x is winding down, and Groovy scripting is dead (removed in 6.0.0). If there is a bug here, there is no guarantee that we will address it. I tell you this for planning purposes, you should start thinking about migration paths.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
