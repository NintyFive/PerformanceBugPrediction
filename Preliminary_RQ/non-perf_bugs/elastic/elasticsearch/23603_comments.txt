It does not return the field even if there is not result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> If that's the case, how can I achieve this solution: retrieving a field in the _source clause only if there is a matching highlight on it?\r\n\r\nThat is the default. I believe you can set the `fragment_size` to `0` or `-1` to return all of the matching field, though that could be very long.\r\n\r\nIf you want to return a portion of the field even if there isn't match there is `no_match_size`.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
