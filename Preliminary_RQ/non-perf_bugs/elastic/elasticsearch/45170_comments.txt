Something *outside* of Elasticsearch is killing the JVM that we start to determine the startup flags. This is almost surely your kernel OOM killer (check your system logs). I don't think there is an Elasticsearch issue. Free free to update this issue with additional information if you think that it is, we would be happy to re-open this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
