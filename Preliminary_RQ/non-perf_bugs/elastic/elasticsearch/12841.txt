We append several attachments to our elastic document. Alle attachments are stored in an array of sub documents called \"ANY_BLOB\". This is mapped to the \"attachment\" type. Per mapping we add a Field \"Reference\" to the ANY_BLOB sub document mapping. This is stored and retrieved well. But if we use the \"highlight\"-feature, we got the highlighting of some of the \"ANY_BLOB\"s, no idea to which subdocument it belongs. Is there any way to assign the \"Reference\"-Field to the highlighting? In fact we have to know, which of the ANY_BLOB-Attachments caused the highlighting.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
