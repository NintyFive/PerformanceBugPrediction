As initial 'Scroll' search request returns documents but 'Scan' does not, when scanning you cannot really tell whether scanning finished by just empty hits but also by `null` scrollId, so that `if (SearchType.Scan && hits.empty && sid == null)` condition is just for the possibility that `index pattern matching` wasn't successful .\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
