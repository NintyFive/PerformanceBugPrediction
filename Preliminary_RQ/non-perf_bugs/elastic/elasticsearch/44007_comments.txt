This makes it\r\nmore likely that your question will receive a useful answer.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/)\r\nthat should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I\r\nhope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
