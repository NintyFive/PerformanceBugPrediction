This will not match `BASE TABLE` and the result is empty. My proposal would be to make the two - `BASE TABLE` and `TABLE` - interchangeable for this query (even though they aren't, technically), unless we do actually differentiate between these two concepts.\r\n* The [ODBC spec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/syntax/sqltables-function) mandates that the `TYPE` parameter, if `not an empty string, [it] must contain a list of comma-separated values for the types of interest; each value can be enclosed in single quotation marks (') or unquoted, for example, 'TABLE', 'VIEW' or TABLE, VIEW.`. Current ES/SQL implementation will accept the quoted list, but won't accept the unquoted format. I haven't yet encountered apps that make use of the unquoted format. The fix for this could obviously be implemented in the driver too -- up for discussion.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
