Each time a script is run, it is associated with a context, which holds the operation/api that is making use of the script, provided by the caller.\n\nWe currently support 4 operations: `search`, `mapping`, `update` and `aggs`. We folded suggester and percolator under search though, which might be confusing for users, hence we might want to create proper distinct categories for them. \n\nEven more importantly, plugins may use our `ScriptService` to expose custom scripted operations, which may not fall into these pre-defined categories. I wonder if we should introduce a new generic category of operations for plugins, which can be enabled/disabled via settings too. This way we may also be able to remove the breaking aspect of this new feature, the problem being that each caller needs to specify which operation it's using the script for, and that is a required argument. Given that we updated all of our internal calls to provide that argument, we could now restore the original methods without the `ScriptContext` argument and assume that those calls come from plugins, by assigning them the default plugins category.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
