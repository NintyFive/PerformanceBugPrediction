I have seen cases when using multiple LDAP servers that we keep trying to authenticate to an ldap server a failed user (because it doesn't exists). I understand that the realm chain should be ordered probably by \"amount of users\" or similar to have a small impact on negative lookups (of users), but perhaps adding this feature will help a lot ?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/399241619","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29930#issuecomment-399241619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29930","id":399241619,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTI0MTYxOQ==","user":{"login":"tomcallahan","id":15988488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTg4NDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15988488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan","html_url":"https://github.com/tomcallahan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcallahan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T20:58:57Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T20:58:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It has been quite some time since this issue has had any attention - please re-open if you feel this is still important @jaymode @gmoskovicz ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
