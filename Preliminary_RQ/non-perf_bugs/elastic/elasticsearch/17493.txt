The nodes are hosted on AWS EC2 each with an attached EBS of 10 GB. I was trying to increase the EBS size to 20GB for each node and it all went fine until I went and restarted the cluster master.\n\nIt took about 30 seconds for the cluster to elect a new master and during that time all requests failed and all the other node gave me the 503 error when I tried to check their status.\n\nI am wondering if there is a way to change the cluster master to a specific node instantly without having to wait for the nodes to elect a new master.\n\nFor example, lets say my cluster has three nodes:\n\nNode1 (Cluster Master)\nNode2\nNode3\n\nWhat I would like to do is change the size of the drive for lets say Node2, then once that node joins the cluster and all shards get reallocated, I force elect it as the cluster master, then I can safely change the configuration for the other two nodes.\n\nIs this possible in ES? If not, how can I go about reducing the time it takes for the nodes to elect a new master?\n","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
