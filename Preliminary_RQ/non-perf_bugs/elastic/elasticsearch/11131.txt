It is rejected by elasticsearch for only having 4 elements and not 5. This strict requirement is not consistent with GeoJSON. Please allow elasticsearch to accept this Object, out of the box, because technically it is legal GeoJSON. Currently I must write a middle-man to add a 5th-element (cue Bruce Willis jokes here) to this array of coordinates. This is a bit kludgy in terms of workflow:\n\n```\n\"bounding_box\": {\n        \"type\": \"Polygon\",\n        \"coordinates\": [\n        [\n        [\n        -9.0915413,\n        38.6713816\n        ],\n        [\n        -9.0915413,\n        38.9313732\n        ],\n        [\n        -8.8102479,\n        38.9313732\n        ],\n        [\n        -8.8102479,\n        38.6713816\n        ]\n        ]\n        ]\n        },\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
