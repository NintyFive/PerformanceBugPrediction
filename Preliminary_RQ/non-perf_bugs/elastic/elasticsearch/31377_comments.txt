The reason that we tightened it is that previously we called `Objects.toString(..)` on an object we didn't know how to encode, however, this can lead to encoding JSON with strings like `\"[B@724af044\"` because the object didn't have a good `toString()` method. Rather than allow this we purposefully throw this exception.
