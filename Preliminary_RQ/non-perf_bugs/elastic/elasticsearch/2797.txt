This can be easily verified by running a simple query with the facet value. Additionally, changing the size parameter will cause facet results to change (while we only expected to get a shorter/longer list , we actually see values change and terms disappear).\n\nOur faceting query:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  \"from\" : 0,\n  \"size\" : 0,\n  \"query\" : {\n    \"filtered\" : {\n      \"query\" : {\n        \"query_string\" : {\n          \"query\" : \"test\",\n          \"fields\" : [ \"title\", \"topic\" ]\n        }\n      },\n      \"filter\" : {\n        \"numeric_range\" : {\n          \"topic_date\" : {\n            \"from\" : \"2012-12-17T00:00:00.000+02:00\",\n            \"to\" : \"2013-03-17T23:59:59.999+02:00\",\n            \"include_lower\" : true,\n            \"include_upper\" : true\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"facets\" : {\n    \"termFacet\" : {\n      \"terms\" : {\n        \"fields\" : [ \"author\" ],\n        \"size\" : 10\n      },\n      \"facet_filter\" : {\n        \"numeric_range\" : {\n          \"topic_date\" : {\n            \"from\" : \"2012-12-17T00:00:00.000+02:00\",\n            \"to\" : \"2013-03-17T23:59:59.999+02:00\",\n            \"include_lower\" : true,\n            \"include_upper\" : true\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
