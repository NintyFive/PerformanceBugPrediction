I work in Developer Relations at Elastic. I understand it must've taken you a significant bit of time to reproduce it and figure out the root cause. Thank you for doing that.

Could you send us a quick \"hello\" email us at developerrelations [at] elastic.co and we'll figure out how best to get you the gift there? Thanks again!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
