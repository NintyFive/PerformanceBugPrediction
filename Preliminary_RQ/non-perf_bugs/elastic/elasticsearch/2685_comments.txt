So, `_all` is only used as a placeholder when we require a positional parameter, eg `/index/type/_search` - you can't specify a type without having a value for index. But you can specify an index without a type.  \n\nGiven that nobody else has commented on this issue in a year and a half, I'm going to wager that it is not a big problem and close it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/51598265","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2685#issuecomment-51598265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2685","id":51598265,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTk4MjY1","user":{"login":"michaelklishin","id":1090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelklishin","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelklishin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelklishin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelklishin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelklishin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelklishin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelklishin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelklishin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelklishin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelklishin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelklishin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T13:14:49Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T13:14:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley yes, it's not a big deal.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
