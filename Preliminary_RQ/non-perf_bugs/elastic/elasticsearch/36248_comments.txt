The elasticsearch PassageFormatter trims whitespace from the edges of snippets, to prevent results like ` is <b>great</b> for search` with a leading space being returned.  We should probably reject `pre-tag` and `post-tag` values that would get removed by this.  As a workaround, you can use different tags and then replace them in the client if you need to use `/r`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/444461371","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36248#issuecomment-444461371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36248","id":444461371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDQ2MTM3MQ==","user":{"login":"tmo-trustpilot","id":13134751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTM0NzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13134751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmo-trustpilot","html_url":"https://github.com/tmo-trustpilot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmo-trustpilot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmo-trustpilot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmo-trustpilot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmo-trustpilot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmo-trustpilot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmo-trustpilot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmo-trustpilot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmo-trustpilot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmo-trustpilot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-05T11:59:34Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T11:59:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, yeah that makes sense.
