I think there are two ways to fix it:\n1. make these filters run on top of field data,\n2. or add a new metadata field that we could eg. call `_field_names` that would index all field names of a document.\n\nWorking on field data has the drawback of requiring a lot of stuff to be loaded into memory if the field doesn't have doc values, and the returned filter cannot skip.\n\nI tend to like indexing field names because it would not load anything into memory with a default setup, and the returned filter could skip efficiently since it would be based on a postings list. But unfortunately it could not be used on indices that have been created before we introduce this new metadata field.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
