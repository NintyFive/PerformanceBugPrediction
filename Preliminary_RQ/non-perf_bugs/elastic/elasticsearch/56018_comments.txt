mentioned in the sync that we should document this as a breaking change but the conversation moved on before I had a chance to disagree, so I'm raising that here. I don't think we need to call the change to the default a breaking change. The default is already `Long.MAX_VALUE` on `FsRepository`, and we only need to care about the official services for the other repositories (plus Minio which [claims to support objects up to 5TB](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/docs/minio-limits.md#limits-of-s3-api) just like S3 proper).\r\n\r\nI think there's value in keeping the setting around indefinitely however, there are situations where the maximum blob size supported by the repository may be under the user's control (e.g. CephFS) or may not correspond with the maximum filesize of the data store.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/624546191","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56018#issuecomment-624546191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56018","id":624546191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDU0NjE5MQ==","user":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T09:42:19Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T09:42:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"++ David, updated my comment accordingly.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
