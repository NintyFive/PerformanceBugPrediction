Lucene complains that the creation versions differ because we changed the way norms are encoded in Lucene 7, so you can't add Lucene 6 files to a Lucene 7 index. We should fix shrinking to also carry over the Lucene creation version, in addition to the Elasticsearch creation version.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
