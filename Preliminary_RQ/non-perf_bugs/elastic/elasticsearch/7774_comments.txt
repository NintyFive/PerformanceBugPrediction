ES would need to create a priority queue of size `from` + `size` of each shard for sorting purposes. Actually in this case we can't event create a priority queue, because from + size is larger then Integer.MAX_VALUE.\n\nWhat is the reason for the high `from` usage? If you want to retrieve all the documents from ES in a particular order then I suggest you use the scroll api. This doesn't create a priority query of size `from` + `size`, but just a size equal to `size`. See for more information: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-scroll.html#search-request-scroll\n\nThe error message is cryptic and we should fail requests like this in a better and more descriptive way.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/56876078","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7774#issuecomment-56876078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7774","id":56876078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODc2MDc4","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-25T20:09:13Z","updated_at":"2014-09-25T20:09:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed by #7778 \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
