In our use case the terms have part-of-speech tags as prefixes which we want to take into account when we compute the score. \n\nHere is an example: \n- the terms \"blue\" and \"car\" have the absolutely same document frequencies in the index\n- blue is an adjective and is indexed as adj_blue \n- car is a noun and is indexed as n_car \n- nouns have score modifier 1.3, adjectives have score modifier 0.3\n\nWe want to to multiply the term scores from an underlying significance heuristic (jlh score, mutual information, chi square, gnd) with the respective modifier. \n","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
