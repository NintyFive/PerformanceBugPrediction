These are issues that are not inherit to the node but rather to the data and query on the node and thus retrying on other nodes will only cause them to have trouble too. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that these are *extremely* hard to identify. We are chasing them one by one and adding protections. Our strategy is not to detect them once they happened (i.e., one node is having trouble) but rather prevent them in advance. You can see examples on https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11511 . \r\n\r\nI'm closing this as I think it's too generic and is better replaced by the concrete list in #11511. Of course, if you run into something we can added to the list, please let us know.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/274447480","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22736#issuecomment-274447480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22736","id":274447480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDQ0NzQ4MA==","user":{"login":"makeyang","id":13898618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODk4NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13898618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang","html_url":"https://github.com/makeyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T10:12:00Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T10:12:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bleskes  sorry for misunderstanding.\r\nactually what I expect here is to add the ability to reject clients' read/write requests with dynamic APIs or dynamic settings","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/274448868","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22736#issuecomment-274448868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22736","id":274448868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDQ0ODg2OA==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T10:18:12Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T10:18:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I see.
