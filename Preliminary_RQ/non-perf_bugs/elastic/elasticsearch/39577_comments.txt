The confusion comes from the fact that we recommend using `*` as a default field in replacement of `all_fields:true`. This behaves the same on the `query_string` query which implicitly sets the lenient flag to `true` when the default field is `*`. However the `simple_query_string` doesn't, which is probably a bug?\r\n\r\nThe other inconsistency is that we automatically set `lenient` to true when `default_field` is `*` but not when `fields` is `[ \"*\" ]` which is a bit confusing too IMO as I would expect both `default_field: *` and `fields: [ * ]` to behave the same as a user.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/468751713","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39577#issuecomment-468751713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39577","id":468751713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODc1MTcxMw==","user":{"login":"jakelandis","id":976291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjI5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/976291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis","html_url":"https://github.com/jakelandis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-01T17:52:09Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T17:52:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Retested
