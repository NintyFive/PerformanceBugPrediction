Currently, trying to create an instance using Lustre fails in NodeEnvironment, specifically in the call to NativeFSLockFactory::obtain because Lustre does not support file locking.\n\nI've tested SimpleFSLockFactory (in isolation from everything else), and that does work.  I'm going to test using SimpleFSLockFactory in NodeEnvironment and see if that will work.  If it does, would there be any interest in having a node.simple_locking option in elasticsearch.yml to help support running on Lustre?  What else am I missing?\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
