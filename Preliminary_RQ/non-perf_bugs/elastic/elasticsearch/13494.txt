the current approach implies understanding the shards topology (which can be tricky and the incorrect _granularity_) to determine the chunks followed by a hacky attempt of locking down a read to a certain chunk which unfortunately is problematic when trying to read aliases or multiple indexes across the same shards (and what issue https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9483 tried to fix).\n## Desired behavior\n\nThe user ideally would simply request the number of splits/chunks for a given query and get back the number of possible partitions/readers ids which then the consumer can start using to get back the results.\nSo for example, the user could ask for 10 chunks for a given index. \n\nES in turn would decide whether it can and how to best create these splits: likely the chunks requested will not match the index topology (such as shards) so a split might spread across multiple shards while another might read only a subset of a shard.\n\nThis would be similar to the scan/scroll approach where the initial query returns a **scroll_id** which in turn, returns the results.\n\nGoing a step further, the user could specify the granularity needed such as: _NODES_ or _SHARDS_ to bound the parallelism based on the actual topology of the target index/indices.\n\nThe user should not have to deal with the actual partition or follow-up connection; rather it would have the relevant information already computed by ES.\nThe chunk should contain locality information - on what node/ip is the data retrieved from.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
