#7036 introduced a new `default` option to the `_timestamp` mapping. \n\nThe main goal was to combat the case when you have a `_timestamp` mapping with `path` set but index a document without the given `path` present.\n\ne.g you have this mapping:\n\n``` json\n\"_timestamp\" : {\n    \"enabled\" : \"yes\",\n    \"path\" : \"post_date\"\n}\n```\n\nand present this document:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"foo\": \"bar\"\n}\n```\n\npre `1.3` the indexation would fail, using `1.4` we default to using `now()` for _timestamp when path is missing. \nTo reintroduce the `1.3` behavior you now have to pass `default: null` giving null the special meaning of mandatory. I can not think of anywhere else where we give null a special meaning.\n\nI personally feel that when you map `_timestamp` with `_path` the default result when you index a document without that `path` should be an exception (as it was before `1.4`).\n\nIf you know your data may not contain the value you should proactively configure for this situation setting a bool `ignore_missing` that falls back to the behavior had `path` not been specified in the mapping in the first place. \n\n1.3 behaviour with a new `ignore_missing` bool configuration:\n\n| `_timestamp` config | Result. |\n| --- | --- |\n| enabled | `now ()` |\n| using path | value of path or :boom: |\n| ignore_missing | value of path or `now()` |\n\n1.4 handling of `_timestamp`\n\n| `_timestamp` config | Result. |\n| --- | --- |\n| enabled | `now()`  |\n| using path | value or `now ()` |\n| using default | `now()`, `<fixed date>` or :boom: if set to null |\n\nOut of these two the `1.3` way of handling `_timestamp` mappings makes the most sense to me.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
