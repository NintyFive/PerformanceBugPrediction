The model you propose is very use-case specific and is prone to race conditions and lots of hidden bugs.  We are not going to complicate aliases like this.\r\n\r\nInstead, you should keep using your original index during reindexing and make multiple passes to ensure that all changes are copied over, then make an atomic switch from old to new index.  In the future we will add a changes api (#1242) which makes this process easier.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/277203867","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22944#issuecomment-277203867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22944","id":277203867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzIwMzg2Nw==","user":{"login":"bra-fsn","id":820331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDMzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/820331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bra-fsn","html_url":"https://github.com/bra-fsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bra-fsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bra-fsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bra-fsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bra-fsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bra-fsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bra-fsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bra-fsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bra-fsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bra-fsn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-03T09:36:05Z","updated_at":"2017-02-03T09:36:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm sad to hear that.
