I believe the intention is for it to only accept a single clause, so multiple query objects should raise a parse exception.\n\nE.g.\n\n``` js\nPOST /test/test/\n{\n    \"foo\": \"a\"\n}\n\nPOST /test/test/\n{\n    \"foo\": \"b\"\n}\n\nPOST /test/test/\n{\n    \"foo\": \"a b\"\n}\n\nGET /test/_search\n{\n   \"query\": {\n      \"constant_score\": {\n         \"filter\": [\n            { \"term\": { \"foo\": \"x\" } },\n            { \"term\": { \"foo\": \"a\" } }\n         ]\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nWhich yields both documents which have `\"a\"`:\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"hits\": {\n      \"total\": 2,\n      \"max_score\": 1,\n      \"hits\": [\n         {\n            \"_index\": \"test\",\n            \"_type\": \"test\",\n            \"_id\": \"AVN8hy3XgPMxNnYnA0TX\",\n            \"_score\": 1,\n            \"_source\": {\n               \"foo\": \"a\"\n            }\n         },\n         {\n            \"_index\": \"test\",\n            \"_type\": \"test\",\n            \"_id\": \"AVN8h2TygPMxNnYnA0Tr\",\n            \"_score\": 1,\n            \"_source\": {\n               \"foo\": \"a b\"\n            }\n         }\n      ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nSwapping the order returns zero documents, because nothing matches `\"x\"`:\n\n``` js\nGET /test/_search\n{\n   \"query\": {\n      \"constant_score\": {\n         \"filter\": [\n            { \"term\": { \"foo\": \"a\" } },\n            { \"term\": { \"foo\": \"x\" } }\n         ]\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"hits\": {\n      \"total\": 0,\n      \"max_score\": null,\n      \"hits\": []\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThis is especially confusing because the `bool` filter clause _does_ support multiple clauses, and by default AND's them together.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
