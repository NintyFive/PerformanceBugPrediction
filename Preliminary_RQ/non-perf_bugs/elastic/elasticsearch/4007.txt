This gives us a good chance to remove things that may have been deprecated for a long time, or rename confusing settings to names that make more sense.\n\nThis issue is for gathering suggestions from any of the community for settings that should be removed/renamed or otherwise changed in a breaking manor for the 1.0 release.\n\nHere are some suggestions to get us started:\n- Remove the `text` query (it was renamed `match` in 0.19.9)\n- Rename `zen.minimum_master_nodes` to something like `zen.minimum_eligible_master_nodes`\n- Unify edit distance naming (@s1monw can chime in on this one?)\n- Rename `cluster.routing.allocation.disable_allocation` -> `cluster.routing.allocation.allow_allocation` (double negatives are confusing)\n- Changing fields element handling in search/get: `_source.X` returns X from _source, `_doc.X` returns X from field data, without auto detecting scripts, thats what `script_fields` are for...\n\nPlease chime in with suggestions and opinions about any other breaking changes!\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
