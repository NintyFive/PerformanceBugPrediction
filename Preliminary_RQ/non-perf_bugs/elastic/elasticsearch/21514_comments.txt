don't think it's a solely duplicate of #16392 because of `access denied (\"java.lang.RuntimePermission\" \"getClassLoader\")` on ES 5. And moreover on ES 5 you cannot circumvent this by disabling the security manager. I think fixing #16392 is easy, just add the \"listen\" action for \"java.net.SocketPermission\".\n\nBy doing this and by adding \"java.lang.RuntimePermission\" \"getClassLoader\" to the policy file (in my own elasticsearch fork) both problems described in this issue are gone.\n\n#16392 is older than 6 month, i add another related issue for ES 5 and all that happens is hitting the duplicate button.

We grant socket permissions dynamically based on the network settings and there is an issue as explained in #16392 for tribe nodes.\n\nThe logging issue appears to be an artifact of the tribe node failing to bind, because of the missed socket permission. Log4j has known issues when run under a security manager. We are not going to grant the runtime permission \"getClassLoader\" to the entire codebase nor to just the Log4j codebase.\n\nI'm sorry that #16392 has sat for so long.
