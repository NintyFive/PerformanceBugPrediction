scripts typically evaluate the last element of an aggregation bucket e.g. for comparing a moving avg to a threshold.  Groovy allows you to do this using a -1 array reference e.g.\n\n`return ctx.payload.aggregations.date_buckets.buckets[-1].doc_count > (ctx.payload.aggregations.percentiles.values['90.0']+(ctx.payload.aggregations.stats.std_deviation*3));`\n\nCurrently painless has no shortcut causing the scripts to be alittle longer e.g. \n\n`return ctx.payload.aggregations.date_buckets.buckets[ctx.payload.aggregations.date_buckets.buckets.length-1].doc_count > (ctx.payload.aggregations.percentiles.values['90.0']+(ctx.payload.aggregations.stats.std_deviation*3));`\n\nMinor.
