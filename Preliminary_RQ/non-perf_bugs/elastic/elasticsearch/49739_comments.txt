Are you thinking about a particular way of ingesting data into Elasticsearch? I'm asking this because Elasticsearch itself doesn't have any particular notion of what an \"@timestamp\" field should be. Its the ingestion processes like Beats or Kibana that add the field and visualizations in Kibana that presuppose its existence, so this issue might better suited for any of those repos.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/560379693","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49739#issuecomment-560379693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49739","id":560379693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDM3OTY5Mw==","user":{"login":"naseemkullah","id":24660299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjYwMjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24660299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naseemkullah","html_url":"https://github.com/naseemkullah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naseemkullah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naseemkullah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naseemkullah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naseemkullah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naseemkullah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naseemkullah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naseemkullah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naseemkullah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naseemkullah/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T12:40:16Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T12:40:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That is true!
