We use a randomized testing framework that is very picky so new features like aggregations can introduce failures that are not reproducible. I am afraid you will see failures here and there if you are on a dev branch like master especially if we are landing large features. That is almost unavoidable. Today I added a lot of trace logging on the aggregations stuff and removed an certain `wait` call that caused these failures to trigger certain logs or make certain failures more likely. I guess today was a bad day to run our tests the first time :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/30174541","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4389#issuecomment-30174541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4389","id":30174541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTc0NTQx","user":{"login":"florianleibert","id":127912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzkxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/127912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianleibert","html_url":"https://github.com/florianleibert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianleibert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianleibert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianleibert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianleibert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianleibert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianleibert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianleibert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianleibert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florianleibert/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-09T21:20:29Z","updated_at":"2013-12-09T21:20:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks so much for the clarification.
