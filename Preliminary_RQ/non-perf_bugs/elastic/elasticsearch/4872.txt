For example 'dobroe utro' that means 'доброе утро' and translates 'good morning'. \n2) Some illiterate people write english words as they hear them. For example 'гугл мапс' - it's transliteration of 'google maps'.\nIt will be nice to improve elasticsearch with transliterate token filter. Something like that:\n\n<pre>\n{\n    index : {\n        analysis : {\n            analyzer : {\n                my_analyzer : {\n                    type : \"custom\",\n                    tokenizer : \"standard\",\n                    filter : [\"standard\", \"lowercase\", \"my_filter\"]\n                }\n            },\n            filter : {\n                my_filter : {\n                    type : \"transliterate\",\n                    ruleSet : \"ICAO\",\n                    direction : \"backward\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n\nSorry for bad english - it's not my first language.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
