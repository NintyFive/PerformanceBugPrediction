off, thank you for a great report and reproduction steps. I went ahead and built out a quick test for this, and found out what you are running up against. \r\n\r\nA JsonNode is Iterable. Our XContentBuilder is assuming that any Iterable is an array in [json](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/libs/x-content/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/xcontent/XContentBuilder.java#L834-L839), which in turn is doing the [following](https://github.com/codehaus/jackson/blob/master/src/java/org/codehaus/jackson/JsonNode.java#L747-L761), which ends up parsing in to something that you dont want it to. \r\n\r\nYour best bet here is to first convert the jsonNode to a Map. One way I found to do it was by using the ObjectMapper `Map jsonMap = mapper.convertValue(jsonNode, Map.class)` and pass that in to the `singletonMap(\"step\", jsonMap)`. I have verified this ends up giving the following\r\n\r\n```\r\n curl localhost:9200/myindex/_doc/1\r\n{\"_index\":\"myindex\",\"_type\":\"_doc\",\"_id\":\"1\",\"_version\":2,\"found\":true,\"_source\":{\"steps\":[{\"field1\":{\"field3\":\"value\",\"field2\":\"value\"},\"field4\":\"value\"}]}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGive that a try to see if it solves your issue.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/417481047","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33221#issuecomment-417481047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33221","id":417481047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzQ4MTA0Nw==","user":{"login":"casper1149","id":4508785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDg3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4508785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casper1149","html_url":"https://github.com/casper1149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casper1149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casper1149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casper1149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casper1149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casper1149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casper1149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casper1149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casper1149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casper1149/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-30T22:00:11Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T22:00:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nthank you for the code pointers and explanation.
