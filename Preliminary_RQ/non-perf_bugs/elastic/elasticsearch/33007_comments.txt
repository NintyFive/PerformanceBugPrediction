In order to do this remote calls need to be made and there is no opportunity to do this in when a settings update consumer gets executed. So it is better to manage auto follow patters via dedicated apis. \r\n\r\nI hoped that dynamic cluster settings would be enough, but this turned out to be not the case.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/449709417","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33007#issuecomment-449709417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33007","id":449709417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTcwOTQxNw==","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-24T09:32:58Z","updated_at":"2018-12-24T09:32:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All tasks have been implemented :tada: ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
