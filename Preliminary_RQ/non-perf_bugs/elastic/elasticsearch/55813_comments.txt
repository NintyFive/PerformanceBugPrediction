I think the \"normal\" way users interact with date fields in query string queries is via using the `[...]` syntax. When using your example (even without the date math and without DST), the query parser tries to build a single term query, which we then rewrite to a range query in our date field mapper logic (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.6/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/mapper/DateFieldMapper.java#L370). \r\nUnfortunately the timezone information that gets used correctly when using \"range\" syntax is lost at that point. I have a draft for a way to force creation of a range query with correct time zone which I'll open a PR for, but we might have to discuss the desired behaviour here in some more depth.
