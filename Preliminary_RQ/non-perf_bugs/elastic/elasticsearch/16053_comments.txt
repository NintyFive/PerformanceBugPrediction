I am not sure that we want to remove this.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, we still support `index/type/_mapping` while ` index/_mapping/type` should be preferred, and that is true for `RestGetMappingAction` and `RestGetFieldMappingAction`, but also  for `RestPutMappingAction. Maybe we should open an issue for this last change only? What do you think @clintongormley ?\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/366923459","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16053#issuecomment-366923459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16053","id":366923459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjkyMzQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T09:47:56Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T09:47:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@javanna that last change will be taken care of by https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15613, so I think we can close this issue.\r\n\r\n@spojan and @dackebro thanks for taking a look - we'd welcome your contributions on another open ticket.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
