We don't provide big decimals data type but the feature is discussed in the linked issue.\r\n\r\nHi, jimczi.\r\nI'm still considering it as a bug. Did you see my description above?\r\nWhen I downloaded the source code 'jackson-core-2.10.4-sources.jar' and decompressed it into my project, and then altered codes in java class 'ParserBase.java' as below:\r\n====================================================================\r\n/********* codes before *********/\r\nif (expType == NR_BIGDECIMAL) {\r\n_numberBigDecimal = _textBuffer.contentsAsDecimal();\r\n_numTypesValid = NR_BIGDECIMAL;\r\n} else {\r\n// Otherwise double has to do\r\n_numberDouble = _textBuffer.contentsAsDouble();\r\n_numTypesValid = NR_DOUBLE;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/********* codes after *********/\r\n_numberBigDecimal = _textBuffer.contentsAsDecimal();\r\n_numTypesValid = NR_BIGDECIMAL;\r\n====================================================================\r\n\r\nAfter finished altering codes, I reran codes of putting single big-decimal record and bulk loaded multi big-decimal records, both of them worked fine, big-decimal value stored correctly into ES(should be queryed by curl shell, not in kibana or web browser).\r\n\r\nSo, don't you think this is a bug?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
