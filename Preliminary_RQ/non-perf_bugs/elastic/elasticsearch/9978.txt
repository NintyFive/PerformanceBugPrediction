For multitermqueries, its a little tricky, which subset of the filters should be used? For example lowercasing is reasonable, stemming is not. \n\nBut lucene already annotates each analyzer component deemed to be \"reasonable\" for wildcards with a marker interface (MultiTermAwareComponent). Things like lowercasefilter have it and things like stemmers dont have it.  This is enough to build a \"chain\", automatically from the query analyzer, that acts reasonably for multitermqueries. \n\nI know we don't use the lucene factories (es has its own), but we have a table that maps between them, i know because its in a test I wrote. So the information is there :)\n\nAll queryparsers have hooks (e.g. factory methods for prefix/wildcard/range) that make it possible to use this, for example solr does it by default, as soon as it did this, people stopped complaining about confusing behavior: both for the unanalyzed, and the analyzed case. it just works.\n\nSorry for the long explanation.\n\nCompare:\n- http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/dev/branches/branch_5x/lucene/analysis/common/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/core/LowerCaseFilterFactory.java?view=markup\n- http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/dev/branches/branch_5x/lucene/analysis/common/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/en/PorterStemFilterFactory.java?view=markup\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
