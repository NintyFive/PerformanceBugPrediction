Looks like the levels dropped after accessing the indices through Kibana, and doing searches against them.. I won't be able to verify this further until early next week, so I will update this issue after I test it and verify that the leak has been corrected.

You can control the size of the heap with ES_HEAP_SIZE (which you should definitely set before starting), plus mlockall etc.\n\nSee the docs here for more details: http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html\n\nElasticsearch also uses some off-heap memory, which may be released back to the OS. I don't believe that anything has changed in related code between 1.4 and 1.5.  I think the most likely thing is that you haven't configured ES correctly yet, and once you do, it will all behave as expected.\n\nI suggest asking further questions on the mailing list instead.  If you do encounter a real memory leak, please reopen this issue.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/99204258","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10906#issuecomment-99204258","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10906","id":99204258,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5MjA0MjU4","user":{"login":"cold-gin","id":4306250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDYyNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4306250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cold-gin","html_url":"https://github.com/cold-gin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cold-gin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cold-gin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cold-gin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cold-gin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cold-gin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cold-gin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cold-gin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cold-gin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cold-gin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-05T20:02:24Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T20:02:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks and sorry for any confusion. Whether it is coincidence or not, I would just like to say that when monitoring the elasticsearch container after upgrading to v1.5.2 I definitely do not see the increasing memory usage behavior that I was seeing earlier where the percentage continued to go up. The memory of the container process has definitely stabilized in 1.5.2 and it was definitely growing from 1.4.0 - 1.5.1. Again, just making this observation. Thank you once again for the information, I greatly appreciate it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
