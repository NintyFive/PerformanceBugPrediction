What we observed:\n\nAfter creating a fresh index (two shards and a `nofielddata` field) any aggregation using the `nofielddata` field can be sent to the index and responses will come back as \"successful\". As shards start to get documents these shards will start to fail with `\"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Field data loading is forbidden on nofielddata\"`, but responses will still be formatted as partial successes. Once the final shard has a document requests will start to actually fail (response with a top level \"error\" property).\n\nThis feels like a serious edge-case, but I figured there isn't any harm in reporting it. \n\n---\n\nHere is a sense script to replicate this:\n\n``` sh\nDELETE /test?ignore_unavailable=true\n\nPOST /test\n{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"number_of_shards\": 2\n  },\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test\" : {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"nofielddata\" : {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"fielddata\" : { \"format\" : \"disabled\" }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPOST /test/test\n{ \"noindex\" : \"foo\", \"nofielddata\" : \"foo\" }\n\nGET /test/test/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"_id\": \"AVJhGARbdsS1hY8oBX1Z\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggs\" : {\n    \"test\" : {\n      \"terms\" : { \"field\" : \"nofielddata\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPOST /test/test\n{ \"noindex\" : \"bar\", \"nofielddata\" : \"bar\" }\n\nGET /test/test/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"_id\": \"AVJhGARbdsS1hY8oBX1Z\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggs\" : {\n    \"test\" : {\n      \"terms\" : { \"field\" : \"nofielddata\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
