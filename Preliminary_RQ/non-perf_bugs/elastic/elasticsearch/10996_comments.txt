It can be used on the main field only, to the same effect.  There is similar confusion with using `include_in_all` on sub-fields.  Users think that the tokens from the sub-fields end up being added to `_all`, when really it is just the string value of the main field which is passed to `_all`.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/100133842","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10996#issuecomment-100133842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10996","id":100133842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDEzMzg0Mg==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-08T07:36:13Z","updated_at":"2015-05-08T07:36:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@clintongormley Great!
