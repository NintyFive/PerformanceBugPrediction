For example, if your values require about 40 bits (eg. a timestamp) and you aggregate more than 2^24 of them, you would need more than 64 bits to store the sum. On the other hand, double values would still be able to store such large numbers and accuracy would degrade gracefully.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
