version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): 6.2.4\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nIf a user is allowed to write to an alias, but not its concrete index, then indexing a document with new mappings can produce the following authorization exception:\r\n ```\r\n {\r\n  \"error\" : {\r\n    \"root_cause\" : [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\" : \"security_exception\",\r\n        \"reason\" : \"action [indices:admin/mapping/put] is unauthorized for user [test_user]\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"type\" : \"security_exception\",\r\n    \"reason\" : \"action [indices:admin/mapping/put] is unauthorized for user [test_user]\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"status\" : 403\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior is confusing, because `write` permissions should allow for both indexing and updating mappings, and the user can successfully make a put mapping request directly.\r\n\r\nNote that if the user is also given `write` privileges to the underlying index, then attempting to index the document succeeds. This fact suggests that the implicit `mappings` call during indexing is maybe being validated against the concrete index, instead of the alias.\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29874.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nGist: https://gist.github.com/jtibshirani/ff8ebcd235dc8be36ecd84543b29525d\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
