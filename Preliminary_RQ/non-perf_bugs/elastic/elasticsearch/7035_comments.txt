Two weird things:\n1. your `20140501` strings are not recognisable dates\n2. your mapping doesn't include the `_default_` mapping that you specified at the beginning of your recreation\n\nHere is my recreation:\n\n```\nDELETE /_all\n\nPUT /myindex\n{\n   \"mappings\": {\n      \"_default_\": {\n         \"dynamic_templates\": [\n            {\n               \"date_string\": {\n                  \"match\": \"*_s\",\n                  \"mapping\": {\n                     \"type\": \"string\"\n                  }\n               }\n            }\n         ]\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nPOST /myindex/test_type\n{\n    \"updated_dt\" : \"2014/05/01\",\n    \"updated_dt_s\" : \"2014/05/01\"\n}\n\nGET /myindex/_mapping\n```\n\nAnd the mapping looks like this:\n\n```\n{\n   \"myindex\": {\n      \"mappings\": {\n         \"_default_\": {\n            \"dynamic_templates\": [\n               {\n                  \"date_string\": {\n                     \"mapping\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                     },\n                     \"match\": \"*_s\"\n                  }\n               }\n            ],\n            \"properties\": {}\n         },\n         \"test_type\": {\n            \"dynamic_templates\": [\n               {\n                  \"date_string\": {\n                     \"mapping\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                     },\n                     \"match\": \"*_s\"\n                  }\n               }\n            ],\n            \"properties\": {\n               \"updated_dt\": {\n                  \"type\": \"date\",\n                  \"format\": \"yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy/MM/dd\"\n               },\n               \"updated_dt_s\": {\n                  \"type\": \"string\"\n               }\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/50150634","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7035#issuecomment-50150634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7035","id":50150634,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTUwNjM0","user":{"login":"skystebnicki","id":8267188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjcxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8267188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skystebnicki","html_url":"https://github.com/skystebnicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skystebnicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skystebnicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skystebnicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skystebnicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skystebnicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skystebnicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skystebnicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skystebnicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skystebnicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T13:43:58Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T13:43:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley Thanks so much for the help!
