You can use the `terms` aggregation with a script to achieve this, field collapsing is a special case to speed up `terms` aggregation when only the top hits need to be collapsed. If you are in a discovery mode then the `terms` aggregation has all the power to achieve what you need.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
