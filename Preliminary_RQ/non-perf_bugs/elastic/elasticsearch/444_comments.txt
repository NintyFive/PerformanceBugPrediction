Fundamentally, what does this setting get you? Maybe, a extra durability in case of a getting killed before snapshotting? \n\nNot sure if this is completely on topic for this, but when a doc is indexed, it can never fail on one replica and succeed on another, correct? I ask, because I have been and still am seeing minor consistency issues when I test bringing nodes up and down on latest master.\n\nThanks!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/532102","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/444#issuecomment-532102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/444","id":532102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjEwMg==","user":{"login":"ppearcy","id":307414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzQxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/307414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy","html_url":"https://github.com/ppearcy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-11-10T16:45:33Z","updated_at":"2010-11-10T16:45:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Err... nevermind about the second part...
