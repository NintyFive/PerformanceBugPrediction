Reason being that I would like to have use of some groovy functions on the source fielddata, such as `distanceInMiles(lat,lon)`.\n\n2 Problems were noticed with the Reindex API while doing this:\n1.  When `script_fields` was specified, the reindex API threw a `NullPointerExeption` because it could no longer find the `_source`, which was resolved with `\"fields\": [\"_source\" ],`.\n2.
