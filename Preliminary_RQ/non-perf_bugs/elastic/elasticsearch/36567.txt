This is the requirement that is simple to forget.\r\n\r\nThis can be simplified by allowing users to configure Elasticsearch to automatically map IDP groups to its roles. By default, it can be disabled and enabled by explicitly specifying a parameter in the realm settings.\r\n\r\nAs a possible safety measure, require users to explicitly create a role and assign permissions. Otherwise, log a warning message with the names of groups that cannot be mapped to roles.\r\n\r\ncc @jkakavas ","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
