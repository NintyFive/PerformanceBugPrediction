Currently I store indices in EBS (EC2). I was considering changing location of translog to faster (local) storage with low access latency and more IOPS. I realized it is not possible now. Though i found TranslogConfig class in source code. Moreover there is path already, just waiting to get new functionality :)\n\nThe only limitation is that TranslogConfig's path depends only on _shardPath().resolveTranslog()_â€‹\n\n`new TranslogConfig(shardId, shardPath().resolveTranslog(), indexSettings, bigArrays);`\n\nWhat if translog path is configurable with prefix? This would make it possible to store translog in local directories.\n\nPS. I am sure that translog is reducing the ingestion throughput. CPU wait time varies from 15% to 20%. When I change translog strategy to async it dropped to 6%.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
