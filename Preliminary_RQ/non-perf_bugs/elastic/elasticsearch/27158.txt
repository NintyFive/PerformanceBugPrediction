For example: the code base is changed, the `docs` are updated but the `rest-api-spec` still refers to no-longer-existing parameter names (#27124, https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/d6af6697766 and https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/51d53791fe7). Or a required path part is still wrongly marked as not required (#25988)\r\n\r\nWriting explicit tests is error prone - forgetting to add a new parameter or change an existing one is way too common.\r\n\r\nWe should have a more robust approach to verify that the `rest-api-spec`s remain valid. It is not possible to gurantee that all parameters are exposed to the `rest-api-apec` but at least we should attempt to check that every parameter in the `rest-api-spec` can actually be used.\r\n\r\nHas this been discussed before / is there any prior art related to this style of tests?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
