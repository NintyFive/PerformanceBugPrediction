This sounds like a user question, so if this relates to your use of elasticsearch in a FIPS 140 environment using the BouncyCastle crypto provider, feel free to open a post in our [discuss forums](https://discuss.elastic.co) or contact your support engineer if you are a customer. \r\n\r\nThat said I'd start by reading section 2.3 in [BC user guide](https://downloads.bouncycastle.org/fips-java/BC-FJA-UserGuide-1.0.2.pdf) and maybe [this thread in their mailing list](http://bouncy-castle.1462172.n4.nabble.com/Issues-with-random-seeding-under-FIPS-td4659846.html)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
