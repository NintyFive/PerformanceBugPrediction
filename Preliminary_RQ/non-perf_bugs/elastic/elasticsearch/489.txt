So a few things should change to support this:\n- Field or Type mappings to analyzers should be one-to-many, where you may have a default analyzer and a language specific analyzer for each.\n- Scoping of queries can be by language, or _all\n- Physical indexes should be divided by language so that each ES \"index\" basically has a subindex by language so that documents on that language use the appropriate analyzers consistently for indexing and querying\n\nLanguage handling is a typical problem, that is always ignored and treated with hacks or patterns of use...  instead let's get it right for ES.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
