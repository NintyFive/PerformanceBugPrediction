I'd prefer that we do something more general like parse once and cache the parsed and validated value internal to the `Settings` object, so that the next time we get the setting value we can use the internal cache and skip parsing and validation there. That will involve some boxing for settings of primitive type, but I suspect that will be okay, and there's ways around it if it proves to be a problem.
