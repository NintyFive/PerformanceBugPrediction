Both of them can be ordered by count and total (+key resp. time) but the reverse_\\* counterpart for both count and total is not supported, even though it could be useful in many situations.\n\nThe thinking behind this is to enable one to quickly find the bucket with either the minimum or maximum count/total (of whatever numeric field) without having to retrieve/parse and look at the end of the facet entries array.\n\nTaking this one step further, if those two facets would support a \"size\" parameter, one could specify size=1 and sort=reverse_total in order to find the one bucket with the highest total value.\n\nOne real-world use case for this could be to find the day for which the highest/lowest turnover was achieved (or whatever numeric figure you can think about). If the business has been going on for 10 years, we have 3650 buckets to return/parse/digest and we're only interested in the last one.\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
