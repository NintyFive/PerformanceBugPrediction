[Documented here: Terms Query - Terms lookup mechanism](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-terms-query.html#query-dsl-terms-lookup). I'm proposing making the lookup's \"id\" parameter optional, and adding a \"query\" parameter which supports the full query DSL.\r\n\r\nThis would give ElasticSearch a functional equivalent to this common SQL statement.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT * \r\nFROM TableA a\r\nWHERE a.Field1 IN (SELECT DISTINCT b.Field2\r\n                   FROM TableB b\r\n                   WHERE b.Field3 LIKE '%blah%')\r\n-- TableA & TableB could of course be the same table\r\n-- Field1, Field2, and Field3 could of course be the same field\r\n```\r\nGiven my proposed change to the terms query, the equivalent in ES Query DSL to this SQL would be:\r\n```Javascript\r\nPOST /TableA/_search\r\n{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"terms\": {\r\n            \"Field1\": {\r\n                \"path\": \"Field2\",\r\n                \"index\": \"TableB\",\r\n                \"query\": { //query parameter here, instead of id parameter\r\n                    \"query_string\": { \"query\": \"*blah*\", \"default_field\": \"Field3\" }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
