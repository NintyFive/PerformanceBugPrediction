I suggest that you looked at the code, specially RestoreService, and see how it works. The \"original\" index names are stored in the snapshot file and can be retrieved using the SnapshotInfo. The original index names are then resolved through the RepositoryMetadata, and then renamed if the restore request has renaming options. The idea here is to specify, when possible, the original name along with the renamed ones if the snapshot restore fails in the very first steps of its execution.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
