Quite likely nothing wrong here. The thing that confuses me a bit is that from the Marvel plots you can see the breaker limit being set to 8Mb, the request trip count staying at 0, and the request estimated size passing the limit. The way I interpreted the documentation makes it look like the memory allocated per request is higher than 8Mb but the requests are not failed and reported in the stats.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/214908875","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17952#issuecomment-214908875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17952","id":214908875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDkwODg3NQ==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T22:39:04Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T22:39:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Okay, thanks for checking @kuramae, I'm going to close this now, but feel free to comment/re-open if you see CircuitBreakingExceptions that don't increment the counter!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
