I have 4 nodes in my cluster and each of them can be data or master nodes. Now, i want to create a client node that will ping one of my other 4 nodes. My intention is that even if one of my 4 main nodes goes down, my client will be able to get data from some node that is functional.\n\nHere is my elasticsearch.yml for client\n\n```\ncluster.name: myCluster\nnode.name: myClient\nnode.master: false\nnode.data: false\ndiscovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [\"box1:9300\",\"box2:9300\",\"box3:9300\",\"box4:9300\"]\ndiscovery.zen.fd.ping_timeout: 30s\ndiscovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 3\ndiscovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false\n```\n\neach of the above boxes are configured as\n\n```\ncluster.name: myCluster\nnode.name: n2\npath.data: /asd/thth/jtjut/elastic\npath.logs: /var/log/eslogs\nnetwork.host: box2\nnode.master: true\nnode.data: true\nindex.number_of_replicas: 1\ndiscovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [\"box1:9300\",\"box2:9300\",\"box3:9300\",\"box4:9300\"]\ndiscovery.zen.fd.ping_timeout: 30s\ndiscovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 3\ndiscovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false\n\naction.disable_delete_all_indices: true\n\nhttp.cors.enabled: true\nhttp.cors.allow-origin: \"*\"\n```\n\nbut when i start the elasticsearch service on the client, i get\n\n```\n[2016-03-31 10:24:07,576][INFO ][discovery.zen            ] [myClient] failed\nto send join request to master [{n2}{5vlJHDZaQhGttqZsD5gVvA}{34.87.98.213}{34.87.98.213:9300}{master=true}], reason [RemoteTransportException[[n2] 34.87.98.213:9300][internal:discovery/zen/join]]; nested:ConnectTransportException[[myClient][127.0.0.1:9300] connect_timeout[30s]]; nested: NotSerializableExceptionWrapper[Connection refused: /127.0.0.1:9300]; ]\n```\n\nwhy am i getting connection refused exception? is there anything missing from my configurations?\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Install elasticsearch on client machine\n2. Update elasticsearch.yml to create client node\n3. Run elasticsearch on client machine\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
