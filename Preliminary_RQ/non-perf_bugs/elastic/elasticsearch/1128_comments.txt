This content is then available for display (hightlighting). This has not much to do with the combo analyzer.\n\nYes, the tokens take, if they get repeated by the combo analyzer, more space - but only for referencing, positions, frequency for scoring, and the like, not in the dictionary (the index is inverted!) so this is neglectable.\n\nDuring a Lucene search, the query words are transformed into tokens for matching documents in the index by the analyzer for the field. It is always recommended to use the same analyzer for indexing and for search. Otherwise your search results are getting unpredictable. This holds also for the combo analyzer. The situation is more relaxed, as you will mostly get results if you just use a subanalyzer on the combo analyzed field.\n\nIf you like to follow up, I would recommend asking questions on the Elasticsearch mailing list, because not everybody will be able to monitor the github issue tracking system for interesting discussions.
