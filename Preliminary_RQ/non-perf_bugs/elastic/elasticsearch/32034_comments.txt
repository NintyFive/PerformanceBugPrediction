One such endpoint is `_cat/aliases` in the (unlikely) case where no indices exist.\r\n\r\nIt can be demonstrated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. `./gradlew run` (i.e. no security)\r\n2. In a browser go to http://localhost:9200/_cat/aliases\r\n3. Note the blank response\r\n4. CTRL+C ES\r\n5. `./gradlew run -Dtests.es.xpack.license.self_generated.type=trial`\r\n6. In a browser go to http://localhost:9200/_cat/aliases\r\n7. Log in with elastic / password\r\n8. The result is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"error\":{\"root_cause\":[{\"type\":\"index_not_found_exception\",\"reason\":\"no such index\",\"index_uuid\":\"_na_\",\"index\":\"_all\"}],\"type\":\"index_not_found_exception\",\"reason\":\"no such index\",\"index_uuid\":\"_na_\",\"index\":\"_all\"},\"status\":404}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is extremely unlikely to affect any customer, as anyone creating an ML job probably has at least one other index.\r\n\r\nBut possibly what we should do is wait for the job results index to exist before returning from creating a job.  This would give a more consistent end-user experience - the instant create job returns you could safely search the job results index without risk of an exception.\r\n\r\nI assume the reason this bug has surfaced now is that creating an index on a multi-node cluster takes longer than on a single node cluster so it's another side-effect of switching the native tests to a 3 node cluster.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/405179982","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32034#issuecomment-405179982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32034","id":405179982,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTE3OTk4Mg==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-16T08:35:12Z","updated_at":"2018-07-16T08:35:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Another instance:\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+6.x+multijob-windows-compatibility/1184/console","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/405184772","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32034#issuecomment-405184772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32034","id":405184772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTE4NDc3Mg==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-16T08:56:33Z","updated_at":"2018-07-16T08:56:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Another instance in 6.x:\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+6.x+multijob-unix-compatibility/os=sles/1184/console\r\nI muted the tests in 6.x and master","performed_via_github_app":null}]
