This works great for most deployments where heterogeneous hardware is common, but it often fails when you have a hot/cold deployment with vastly different hardware for the two segments.\n\nFor example, if you have hot nodes with 3 TB of super fast storage and cold nodes with 20 TB of slower storage, then you may want to have very different rules for how much space should be available between the two groups.\n\nDepending on your deployment, you may also be able to take advantage of certain properties. For example, the cold nodes may never have to deal with merging due to forced merges occurring on the hot nodes. Conversely, hot nodes then do have to deal with normal and final merging to a single segment. And cold nodes may also benefit in some setups where \"summary\" indices get created in the place of full data sets at a dramatically reduced size.\n\nFor this to work, either the setting would have to allow any node to override the cluster-wide setting, or to allow it to be set based on node tags, just as nodes get grouped that way already.\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
