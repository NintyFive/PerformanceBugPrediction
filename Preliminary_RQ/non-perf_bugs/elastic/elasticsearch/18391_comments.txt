If I want a tag cloud of words and group of words appearing in a text field I could do it by analyzing the field with shingles (let's say 1-3 shingles) and then making an aggregation by that field (setting fielddata=true). However I don't need the stop words for a tag cloud, but removing them will result on having for example, for \"word1 stopword word2\" and \"word1 word2\" different aggregation values (\"word1  word2\" and \"word1 word2\"), which may look the same but one has two whitespaces and the other just one.\r\n\r\nI'm facing this same problem while trying to implement an amazon-like autocomplete that is based on a n-gram search and an aggregation over a shingle analyzed field. Only reasonable way I found of achieving what I need is generating an additional field before sending the document to elasticsearch removing the stopwords so they would not be taken into account. And that is just cause when I try to make that aggregation and remove the stop words, they are removed but their postions are still taken into account when generating the aggregation results.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as there is already a \"filler_token\" parameter I think it makes sense that if you set \"\" as filler the multiple spaces resulting of the stopword removal are removed too.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/457011245","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18391#issuecomment-457011245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18391","id":457011245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzAxMTI0NQ==","user":{"login":"fhinze","id":46979818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTc5ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/46979818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhinze","html_url":"https://github.com/fhinze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhinze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhinze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhinze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhinze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhinze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhinze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhinze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhinze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhinze/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-23T23:46:59Z","updated_at":"2019-01-23T23:46:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nyou can remove the redundant whitespaces by using the pattern replace char filter like so:\r\n\r\n`\"whitespace_remove\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"pattern_replace\",\r\n        \"pattern\": \" +\",\r\n        \"replacement\": \" \"\r\n        }`\r\n\r\nHowever, you'll still have the same issue @vchalmel has. \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/460926958","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18391#issuecomment-460926958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18391","id":460926958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDkyNjk1OA==","user":{"login":"alejandro-marques","id":12656205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjU2MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/12656205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-marques","html_url":"https://github.com/alejandro-marques","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-marques/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-marques/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-marques/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-marques/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-marques/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-marques/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-marques/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-marques/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-marques/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-06T07:33:13Z","updated_at":"2019-02-06T07:33:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the suggestion @fhinze.
