The reason is that there could potentially be multiple configurations, versions, etc. to support. Since there is probably a wide variety of cases, we may end up either supporting just a small subset of cases that are similar to some default that we assume or constantly firefighting edge cases that we were not aware of, because, at the end of the day, we only control one side of this equation.\r\n\r\nIf you or others in the community will develop such a tool, we will happily assist in advice or in answering questions on the forum. You may also consider the option to develop SolrToES migration documentation in addition or even instead of a migration tool. Such documentation will for sure help professionals performing SolrToES migration while allowing them to find specific solutions for their unique data, configuration, version, etc.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
