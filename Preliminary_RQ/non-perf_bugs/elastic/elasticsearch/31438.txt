But when getting dates from my document, I get JodaTime ReadableDateTime objects.\r\n\r\nSo I'm using the following to convert between JodaTime date object and Java 8 date objects :\r\n\r\n    var date = doc['subscribed_at'].value\r\n    Instant.ofEpochMilli(date.getMillis()).atZone(ZoneId.of(date.getZone().getID()))\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the [Painless API reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/6.2/painless-api-reference.html), `getZone()` is not whilelisted, which prevents me from converting the time properly by taking the timezone into account.\r\n\r\nSo, would it be possible to whitelist the `getZone()` method?\r\nOr maybe I am missing something and there is a simpler way to do what I'm trying to do?","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
