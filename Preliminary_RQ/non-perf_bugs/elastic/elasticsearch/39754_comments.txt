The specific task causing the problem is related to xpack upgrades, and was likely a result of `MigrationIT#testUpgradeWithTaskApi`.\r\n\r\nHowever I don't think any action is required, since we recently removed this API and associated tests in #40075. I'm going to close out the issue, but we re-open it if a similar failure pops up again.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
