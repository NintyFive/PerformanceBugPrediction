I think it would be great to remove this extra directory level, as it makes working from a shell that much simpler (not everyone always works from an IDE).  Since it would be hard to maintain an open PR for this, I thought I would first open an issue to get agreement. If we agree, I would do it on a weekend to minimize merge conflicts for open PRs (although in my experience moves will merge ok, as long as too much wasn't change in a branch from the original file).\n\nNote that from the build side, the change is trivial (only needs to be changed in BuildPlugin).\n\nSo the directory changes would be:\n`src/main/java` -> `src/java`\n`src/main/resources` -> `src/resources`\n`src/test/java` -> `src/test`\n`src/test/resources` -> `src/test-resources`\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
