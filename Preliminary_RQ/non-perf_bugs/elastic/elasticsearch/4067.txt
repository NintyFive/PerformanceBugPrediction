I would like to be able to use one single apache reverse proxy in front of many elastic-search nodes which multiplexes depending on the context path:\nhttp://apache/es1/ should go to http://internal01:9200/es1/\nhttp://apache/es2/ should go to http://internal01:9201/es2/\nhttp://apache/es3/ should go to http://internal02:9200/es3/\n...\nWhat I need for this to work is a way to tell the elasticsearch node that it should use a context-path (e.g. es1): generated links should use this context-path and it should be ignored when testing paths.\n\nCheers,\nDimo\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
