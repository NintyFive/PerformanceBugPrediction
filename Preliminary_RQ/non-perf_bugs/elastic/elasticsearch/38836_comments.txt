I think this is in all likelihood a good idea regardless of the access pattern when it comes to S3.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning would be: S3 is our \"least consistent\" blob store, we probably don't ever want to move to an access pattern that would update old blobs in any way because updates are where the danger lies in the first place => without updates to old (large > 1MB) blobs this is a win in every scenario that keeps snapshots longer than a month imo.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should still make this an option though since it would increase cost in scenarios where no snapshot lives for more than a month (not sure how frequent that is but still ...)?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/466890666","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38836#issuecomment-466890666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38836","id":466890666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Njg5MDY2Ng==","user":{"login":"pedrostil","id":46263119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjYzMTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/46263119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrostil","html_url":"https://github.com/pedrostil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrostil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrostil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrostil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrostil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrostil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrostil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrostil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrostil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrostil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-25T06:43:27Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T06:45:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey,
