discussed this during Fix-it-Friday. The non-cat APIs that provide the corresponding data here do provide these values as numerics and we think that that's what users should use if they need the data in such a format. We also discussed whether or not we should continue to support non-plain text output for the cat APIs. I will close this issue given that we agreed we should not make any changes here. Whether or not we should remove support for non-plain text output for the APIs is a separate discussion point.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
