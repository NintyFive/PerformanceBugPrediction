It's my opinion. So i have done own implementation in ES-fork itself.\nBut your plugin force me to add rendering of custom attributes along with lucene-defined.\n\nWhen it's something that doesn't match phrase \"storage wrapper over lucene with standard analyzer tool set\" - it's something for plugin. If it match - think it's something to extend ES.  \n\nIt's maybe kind of holywar. After .NET, Java shock me with many-of-many various implementation of base things as streams, buffers and other stuff with many-of-many co-dependencies in 3d party. It's not much good. For me - better - to have fully-functional and standartized API at core level and only specialized - super-perfomance, integration-aware, special-cased code in plugins. \n\nSo I suggest include full token reflection to _analyze itself, while it's still bridging to information that lucene conatins and returns.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/102423590","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11076#issuecomment-102423590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11076","id":102423590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjQyMzU5MA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-15T15:01:27Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T15:01:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @comdiv \n\nWe're trying to keep the Elasticsearch core small and manageable (see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10368) so I agree completely with @johtani that these optional extras should be in a plugin.  @johtani nice work on the plugin - what do you think about making it an official plugin?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/102443481","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11076#issuecomment-102443481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11076","id":102443481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjQ0MzQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"johtani","id":1142449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDI0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1142449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani","html_url":"https://github.com/johtani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-15T15:50:24Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T15:50:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@clintongormley Wow, it is OK for me.
