found this on **1.1.2** -- if it is already fixed in later versions feel free to close:\n\nThe cluster-settings-API happily accepts the string `\"true\"` for the `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled` setting. But -- otherwise I wouldn't file this issue -- `\"true\"` is not interpreted as boolean `TRUE`. This makes for a rather dangerous and difficult to spot user error. Since there is already some parsing in place, that neglects wrong settings, I would expect a non boolean-y string value in the settings JSON to be neglected for boolean settings. I haven't tested other cluster settings were this could occur.\n\nExample settings:\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty\n{\n    \"persistent\":{\n        \"cluster\":{\n            \"routing\":{\n                \"allocation\":{\n                    \"disk\":{\n                        \"watermark\":{\n                            \"low\":\"0.85\",\n                            \"high\":\"0.95\"\n                        },\n                        \"threshold_enabled\":\"true\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith the above settings, the disk.watermark setting is inactive!\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
