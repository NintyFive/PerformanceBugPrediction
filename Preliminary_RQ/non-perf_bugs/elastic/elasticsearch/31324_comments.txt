I don't think it makes sense to replace the original test task, since the configuration of the randomized test is so different, it's obviously a different thing, not compatible at all.

Looking at how the Java plugin is implemented, there's no way to prevent it from creating `test`, however I did find that Gradle 4.8 uses the \"lazy task\" API 'tasks.createLather` whereas .7 had `tasks.create`. This helped me find gradle/gradle-native#710. The mechanism proposed there will not work for us, as it proposes to reduce replace functionality to being able to replace only with tasks of a compatible interface. \r\nSo I do think it's the case that we are doing something Gradle doesn't want us to do. \r\nI also think it's not a best practice to replace tasks, especially the ones in the gradle API with others implementing a different interface. Replacing task actions, or tasks that don't have an interface for configuration would be a different matter. \r\n\r\nI think the best way forward is to disable the `test` task and create the randomized test runner as `utest`, making `test` depend on `utest` so one can still run `./gradlew test` for convenience. Build scripts will configure `utest` instead of `test` - a change for the better imho as it makes things explicit.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/399048584","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31324#issuecomment-399048584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31324","id":399048584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTA0ODU4NA==","user":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T10:05:57Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T10:05:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks to additional diagnostics and information provided by gradle/gradle#5730, we now have a working implementation that replaces the test task. #31496 will help us move in the direction of using the Gradle runner.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
