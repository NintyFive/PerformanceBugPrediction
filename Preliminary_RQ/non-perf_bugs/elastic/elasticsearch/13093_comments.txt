We test that all over the place. Embedded ES doesn't have Boostrap as it's entry point. If you want to embed ES you should use `NodeBuilder.java` and start from there. Every Integration we run against `InternalTestCluster` test is basically embedding Elasticsearch an it works just fine without opening up bootstrap. Bootstrap should be private as much as possible it's basically our main method.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/135545604","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13093#issuecomment-135545604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13093","id":135545604,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTU0NTYwNA==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-27T20:27:56Z","updated_at":"2015-08-27T20:27:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nickminutello Bootstrap is an internal implementation detail, and using it was never officially supported.
