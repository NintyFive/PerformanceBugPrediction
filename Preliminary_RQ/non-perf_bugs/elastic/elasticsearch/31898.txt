brought up in #31739 we should print the Java version in the reproduction line as: \r\n```\r\nJAVA_HOME=$JAVA10_HOME RUNTIME_JAVA_HOME=$JAVA11_HOME ./gradlew\r\n``` \r\nThis will work because the build already requires people to have these env vars set.\r\nWe could also include the full paths instead of the env vars, as the build will have to pass in information anyhow for this to work as the test runner will not be aware what was used to build the tests. \r\n\r\nThis will help reproduce issues that are specific to some java versions without requiring one to look at how the CI job is configured.
