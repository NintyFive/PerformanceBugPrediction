The `_top/searches` API should provide a list of all currently executing queries, how long they have been executing, and the ability to kill a query (where possible).\n\nThis could be implemented as follows:\n- a coordinating node adds an ID to each search, and keeps the search request in some data structure until it is complete\n- a `GET _top/search` request will reach out to all nodes to retrieve currently running requests, their elapsed execution time, and which nodes they are running on\n- `POST _top/search/_kill/[searchid]` will cause the coordinating node to update the timeout for the request to 0, killing the request as soon as possible (if possible)\n\nNOTE: a script like `while (1) {...}` is not killable without restarting affected nodes.  We can't use thread interrupts because they are buggy.\n\nInspired by #4329 \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
