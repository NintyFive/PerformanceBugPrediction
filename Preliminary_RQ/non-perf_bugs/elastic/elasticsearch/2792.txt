issue #2310:\n\nBy now when launching tests, some dir are created under `/data` or `/work` dirs.\nIMHO, it's best to use `/target` dir to hold test dirs.\n\nSo, here is the change proposal:\n- all tests creates data files under `/target/es/data` and work files under `/target/es/work`\n- `src/test/resources/es-test.properties` is created and contain `path.data` and `path.work` settings\n- `pom.xml` is modified to parse test resources and modify `${project.build.directory}` to maven target dir\n- some TestNG tests are modified to use theses settings\n- some _main()_ tests (stress tests) are modified to use theses settings\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
