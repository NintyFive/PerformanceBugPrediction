It seems currently the range filter option fielddata is just a rename of the numeric_range range filter.  Also the current docs dont mention the fact it only works on numeric.\n\nCurrently with the 1.0.0Beta2 it fails if you try a range fielddata query with the following\n\n```\nQueryParsingException[[index] [range] filter field [date.untouched] is not a numeric type]; }]\"\n```\n\nThanks\nZuhaib\n\nEdit:\nI see lucene has \"FieldCacheRangeFilter\" for this support but that currently ES uses TermRangeFilter.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
