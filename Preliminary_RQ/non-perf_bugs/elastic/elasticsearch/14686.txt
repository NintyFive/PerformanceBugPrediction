And this week we've had our Staging cluster completely die, unable to connect to any master node for longer than 5 mins at a time. Looking through the logs we found:\n\n```\n[2015-11-10 16:48:28,531][INFO ][license.plugin.core      ] [CHIVLXSTG045] license for [watcher] - valid\n[2015-11-10 16:48:28,536][ERROR][watcher.license          ] [CHIVLXSTG045]\n#\n# Watcher license will expire on [Wednesday, December 09, 2015]. All configured actions on\n# all registered watches are throttled (not executed) on Watcher license expiration.\n# Watches will continue be evaluated and watch history will continue being recorded.\n# Have a new license? please update it. Otherwise, please reach out to your support contact.\n#\n```\n\nBut this shouldn't be an issue for a month, however uninstalling the watcher and license plugins allowed the cluster to get back to a healthy state. Seems like this is a pretty large bug.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
