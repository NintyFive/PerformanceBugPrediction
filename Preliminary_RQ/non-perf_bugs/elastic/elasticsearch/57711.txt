When the watch ran we would deserialize that object, but we would run the with `superuser` privileges because the `AuthorizationService` would add the role in automatically.\r\n\r\nIf that same `Authentication` object is deserialized on 7.8, it will have no roles, and _will not_ be granted the `superuser` role because the anonymous role logic no longer exists in the `AuthorizationService`.\r\n\r\nWe intend to revert #53453 and come up with a new solution to the original problem regarding reporting of anonymous roles.","closed_by":{"login":"ywangd","id":2344308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDQzMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2344308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd","html_url":"https://github.com/ywangd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
