To compound matters, `contentPdf.content` can't have sub-fields, and doesn't support `copy_to` either.  I realise that this is a real problem, but I can't offer you much of a solution in 2.x.\n\nIn 5.x, we have deprecated the mapper-attachements plugin in favour of the ingest-attachment plugin.  This will extract your document during ingestion so that fields like content, author, etc will actually become part of the `_source` and so will work like any other non-magical field.\n\nSorry I can't give you better news.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/227376942","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18928#issuecomment-227376942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18928","id":227376942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzM3Njk0Mg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T08:40:37Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T08:40:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pholly one correction, the `.content` field _can_  have sub-fields after all\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
