E.g. the query:\n\n``` js\n \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"filter\": [\n              { \"terms\": { \"_parent\": [ [ \"0#2998\", \"0#3029\" ] ] }}\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n```\n\ndoes not return anything for me, while the same with `_routing` instead of `_parent` does.\nIn the result I can clearly see, that the content of the `_parent` field is correct (in this case, has the same value as `_routing`). Also, in 1.x filtering on `_parent` worked.\n\nRegards,\nTamas\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
