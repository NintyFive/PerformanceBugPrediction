So instead of keeping only `top_doc()` for each `collapsed_value` now you keep `top_docs(x)`. And then you can resort each innerhits in-memory since they're small.\r\n\r\nExample query below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /twitter/_search\r\n{\r\n    \"query\": {},\r\n    \"collapse\" : {\r\n        \"field\" : \"user\", \r\n        \"inner_hits\": {\r\n            \"name\": \"last_tweets\", \r\n            \"size\": 5, \r\n            \"sort\": [{ \"date\": \"asc\" }] \r\n        },\r\n        \"max_concurrent_group_searches\": 4 \r\n    },\r\n    \"sort\": [\"user\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope it makes sense.
