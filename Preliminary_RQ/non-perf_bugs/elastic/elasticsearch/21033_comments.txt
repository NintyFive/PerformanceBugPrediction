We've recently fixed the [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/docs-reindex.html) so they are more clear that reindex doesn't set up the destination index. We have https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/20576 where we looked at making reindex not start if the destination index doesn't exist. The implementation is fairly horrible because Elasticsearch doesn't have the right hooks in the right spots and adding them doesn't seem worth it....\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
