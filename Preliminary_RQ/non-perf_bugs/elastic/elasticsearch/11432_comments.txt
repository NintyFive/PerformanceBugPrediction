It'd be nice to see more attention to this in Elasticsearch as well.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/320253612","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11432#issuecomment-320253612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11432","id":320253612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDI1MzYxMg==","user":{"login":"k-oliver","id":2338960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzg5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2338960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-oliver","html_url":"https://github.com/k-oliver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-oliver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-oliver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-oliver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-oliver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-oliver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-oliver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-oliver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-oliver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k-oliver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T13:48:34Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T13:48:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1, our project contains persons (identities) with relations to each other: father, mother, child, ... we want to search for persons with matching related persons. example: all persons with children called 'Oliver'.\r\nwe only need one level in theese relation, e.g. don't want to search for children of children. so inlining the relations is an option but makes it harder to update the documents and produces a lot of duplicated data.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/325956343","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11432#issuecomment-325956343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11432","id":325956343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTk1NjM0Mw==","user":{"login":"AnneMottram","id":22296159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjk2MTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22296159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnneMottram","html_url":"https://github.com/AnneMottram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnneMottram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnneMottram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnneMottram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnneMottram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnneMottram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnneMottram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnneMottram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnneMottram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnneMottram/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-30T10:57:30Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T11:08:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1, our project is also based on object hierarchy - I've had to create a parent-id attribute which I can then feed into a second query as a workaround to this","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/334810784","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11432#issuecomment-334810784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11432","id":334810784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDgxMDc4NA==","user":{"login":"postmodem","id":1182126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODIxMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1182126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/postmodem","html_url":"https://github.com/postmodem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/postmodem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/postmodem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/postmodem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/postmodem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/postmodem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/postmodem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/postmodem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/postmodem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/postmodem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-06T16:53:11Z","updated_at":"2017-10-06T16:53:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1, our project uses a lot of self-referential relations.
