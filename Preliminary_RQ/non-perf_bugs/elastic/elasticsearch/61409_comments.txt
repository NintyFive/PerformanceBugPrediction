The resource creation certainly wasn't totally successful so a 2xx code is inappropriate, and 500 doesn't mean the resource was definitely **not** created so it's legitimate here. The problem could actually be in the request (e.g. nonexistent bucket) in which case we should return a 4xx code, but we can't tell where the problem really is so we opt to give the client the benefit of the doubt with a 500.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
