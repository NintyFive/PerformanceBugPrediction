The fact that #58730 was detected in the early hours of 30th June suggests that the change that introduced the problem of loose `.class` files was made on 29th June.  Hopefully this is a good clue about what needs fixing.","closed_by":{"login":"breskeby","id":77300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/77300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby","html_url":"https://github.com/breskeby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
