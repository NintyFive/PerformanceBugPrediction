The timeout in awaitClose depends on how long it takes for your documents to get to elasticsearch, so you will have to find it experimentally. The awaitclose call is not part of the execute method because some clients are using different strategies to determine when the bulk processing is done. For example, you can have a countdown latch that gets decremented in each afterBulk call. In this case the close method would be the way to go. If you have any other questions regarding usage of bulk processor, please feel free to ask them on the mailing list. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/97461330","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10839#issuecomment-97461330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10839","id":97461330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3NDYxMzMw","user":{"login":"rrphotosoft","id":4465221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjUyMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4465221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrphotosoft","html_url":"https://github.com/rrphotosoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrphotosoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrphotosoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrphotosoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrphotosoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrphotosoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrphotosoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrphotosoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrphotosoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rrphotosoft/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-29T15:13:42Z","updated_at":"2015-04-29T15:13:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@imotov , thanks for your help, and for updating the docs.
