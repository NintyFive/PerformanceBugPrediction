I think it would be better to have the default based on stats, and then have a special value, say \"always\" that would bypass the stats and ensure the filter is cached.  Although I'm not sure how much we need the ability to override the stats based approach, since anything that should be cached should quickly rise statistically.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/63291871","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8449#issuecomment-63291871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8449","id":63291871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMjkxODcx","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-17T11:28:54Z","updated_at":"2014-11-17T11:28:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rjernst @nik9000 I think the `_cache` setting should accept three parameters only: `auto` (default), `true`, `false`.  \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/63699609","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8449#issuecomment-63699609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8449","id":63699609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNjk5NjA5","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-19T19:37:38Z","updated_at":"2014-11-19T19:37:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@clintongormley I like that, defaults are the right place for this.
