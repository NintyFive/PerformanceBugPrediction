Maybe `span_multi` should also accept `term` queries wrapped in a `constant_score`? There might also be things we need to change regarding how we decide on what index options to use on the prefix field type.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a major improvement for users who need to run queries that look like `a NEAR b*` who currently kill their clusters because the `span_multi` expands to too many terms. \r\n\r\nHere is a recreation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT index\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"_doc\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"foo\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"text\",\r\n          \"index_prefixes\": {}\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nPUT index/_doc/1\r\n{\r\n  \"foo\": \"the quick fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nGET index/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"span_near\": {\r\n      \"clauses\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"span_multi\": {\r\n            \"match\": {\r\n              \"prefix\": {\r\n                \"foo\": {\r\n                  \"value\": \"jumps\"\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"span_term\": {\r\n            \"foo\": \"fox\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"slop\": 2\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich triggers:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"root_cause\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"query_shard_exception\",\r\n        \"reason\": \"failed to create query: {\\n  \\\"span_near\\\" : {\\n    \\\"clauses\\\" : [\\n      {\\n        \\\"span_multi\\\" : {\\n          \\\"match\\\" : {\\n            \\\"prefix\\\" : {\\n              \\\"foo\\\" : {\\n                \\\"value\\\" : \\\"jumps\\\",\\n                \\\"boost\\\" : 1.0\\n              }\\n            }\\n          },\\n          \\\"boost\\\" : 1.0\\n        }\\n      },\\n      {\\n        \\\"span_term\\\" : {\\n          \\\"foo\\\" : {\\n            \\\"value\\\" : \\\"fox\\\",\\n            \\\"boost\\\" : 1.0\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ],\\n    \\\"slop\\\" : 2,\\n    \\\"in_order\\\" : true,\\n    \\\"boost\\\" : 1.0\\n  }\\n}\",\r\n        \"index_uuid\": \"L67oony8REGtPcAHC0C8WQ\",\r\n        \"index\": \"index\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"type\": \"search_phase_execution_exception\",\r\n    \"reason\": \"all shards failed\",\r\n    \"phase\": \"query\",\r\n    \"grouped\": true,\r\n    \"failed_shards\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"shard\": 0,\r\n        \"index\": \"index\",\r\n        \"node\": \"MYCVYLGiSiy2tZzASlk7uA\",\r\n        \"reason\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"query_shard_exception\",\r\n          \"reason\": \"failed to create query: {\\n  \\\"span_near\\\" : {\\n    \\\"clauses\\\" : [\\n      {\\n        \\\"span_multi\\\" : {\\n          \\\"match\\\" : {\\n            \\\"prefix\\\" : {\\n              \\\"foo\\\" : {\\n                \\\"value\\\" : \\\"jumps\\\",\\n                \\\"boost\\\" : 1.0\\n              }\\n            }\\n          },\\n          \\\"boost\\\" : 1.0\\n        }\\n      },\\n      {\\n        \\\"span_term\\\" : {\\n          \\\"foo\\\" : {\\n            \\\"value\\\" : \\\"fox\\\",\\n            \\\"boost\\\" : 1.0\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ],\\n    \\\"slop\\\" : 2,\\n    \\\"in_order\\\" : true,\\n    \\\"boost\\\" : 1.0\\n  }\\n}\",\r\n          \"index_uuid\": \"L67oony8REGtPcAHC0C8WQ\",\r\n          \"index\": \"index\",\r\n          \"caused_by\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"unsupported_operation_exception\",\r\n            \"reason\": \"unsupported inner query, should be org.apache.lucene.search.MultiTermQuery but was org.apache.lucene.search.ConstantScoreQuery\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"status\": 400\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @jimczi @romseygeek ","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
