This is because the SimpleQueryParser (from Lucene) creates a PrefixQuery for the term before it goes through any kind of analysis. so it is similar to a term query in that the case matters. I was able to reproduce your search with:\n\n``` sh\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/sqp/doc/11?refresh' -d'{\n  \"body\": \"Professional carpet cleaning\"\n}'\necho\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/sqp/_search?pretty' -d'\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"simple_query_string\": {\n      \"query\": \"Professiona*\"\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nAnd then correctly match it as soon as I switched to using `professiona*` instead of `Professiona*`.\n\nSeeing as how searching for `Professional` seems to work fine (ie, gets analyzed), it would be nice if prefix queries were analyzed, however, since `simple_query_string` is taken from Lucene, it may be trickier to process things beforehand. I will look into it, in the meantime you should be able to lowercase your prefix queries to get them to work.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/34077942","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5008#issuecomment-34077942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5008","id":34077942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDc3OTQy","user":{"login":"abaxanean","id":1536989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzY5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1536989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaxanean","html_url":"https://github.com/abaxanean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaxanean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaxanean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaxanean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaxanean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaxanean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaxanean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaxanean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaxanean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaxanean/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-04T16:31:42Z","updated_at":"2014-02-04T16:31:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, lower-casing the term solves the problem, thank you\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
