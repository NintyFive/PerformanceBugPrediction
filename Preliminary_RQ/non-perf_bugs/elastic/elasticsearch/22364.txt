I'm trying to connect ElasticSearch to a GraphQL API using the Relay connection spec, and I'm hitting a problem where I'm unable to determine whether there are additional results before or after the current set.  I can work around it for the moment by retrieving one more result than I need on the back end of the set, then executing another query for a single result before the set (reversing the order).  This seems clunky though.  Is it possible to get a way to either determine the presence of forward and backward records, or to determine the current set's position within the overall result?  I can see this being a requirement for a lot of use cases.
