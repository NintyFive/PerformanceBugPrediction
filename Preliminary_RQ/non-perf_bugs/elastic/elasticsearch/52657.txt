We have some custom internal plugins, which may certainly be related to a cause in some way, but it's just difficult to tell what the nature of the lock contention is without the ability to reproduce in a test environment, and difficult to distinguish different failure modes from each other.\r\n\r\nCame across https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/38807, which seems to be a great tool for diagnosing such errors (by recording/reporting previous locker). Would it be possible to backport that to the 6.8 branch, help out with diagnosing these errors?","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
