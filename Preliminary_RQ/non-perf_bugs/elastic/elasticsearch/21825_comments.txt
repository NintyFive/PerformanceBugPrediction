The geohash in itself is not really a point, but rather a \"geo-box\". So I think it should be easy to use it in a bounding-box-query, but I cannot provide the same geohash for both points in the query\r\n\r\nI think that there is a need of some decoding here. Maybe we should add that the query was removed and include also that for people previously running a `geohash_cell` query they need now two points (so some decoding outside ES is needed)?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/307789968","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21825#issuecomment-307789968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21825","id":307789968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzc4OTk2OA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-12T13:31:56Z","updated_at":"2017-06-12T13:31:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gmoskovicz see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25154","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/307790713","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21825#issuecomment-307790713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21825","id":307790713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzc5MDcxMw==","user":{"login":"gmoskovicz","id":1675411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU0MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1675411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmoskovicz","html_url":"https://github.com/gmoskovicz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmoskovicz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmoskovicz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmoskovicz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmoskovicz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmoskovicz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmoskovicz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmoskovicz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmoskovicz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmoskovicz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-12T13:34:30Z","updated_at":"2017-06-12T13:34:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @clintongormley for pointing me to this, and @jpountz for creating it.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/375742569","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21825#issuecomment-375742569","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21825","id":375742569,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTc0MjU2OQ==","user":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-23T17:30:19Z","updated_at":"2018-03-23T17:30:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It looks like these methods were removed from the documentation and the query builder.
