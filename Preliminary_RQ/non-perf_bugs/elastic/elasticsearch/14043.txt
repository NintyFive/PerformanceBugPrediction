By this I mean that if an index has been closed, it shoud not be listed by _aliases or _stats api.  I know blocked indices can be asked by \"_cluster/state/blocks\" but unfortunatelly my collegaues using open and close function for starting elasticsearch faster. I mean when they start elasticsearch they close each index after they opening them one by one manually. I told them the best solution would be if more machines being used for elasticsearch as cluster, but they stick to their \"method\". However, they want to search in indices which are closed because the _aliases api got indicies back which are closed (however they are unusable). I know the closed indices are blocked for read write operations, and they can not be used any operation so it would be great if it were an option to use (automatically) closed/blocked indices as deleted indices till they will not be recovered. Could you help me ?  I really don't want to check the indices status before each operation.\n\nI hope this is the right place to solve my issue.\n\nThank you in advance for any help you can provide.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
