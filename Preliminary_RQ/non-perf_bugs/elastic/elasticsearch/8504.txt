When I try to filter my results by using 'filename:\"*.css\"' to get only css files, everything works fine. Using *.js or *.php however doesn't return any results, eventhough files with that ending exist!\nUsing just \\* or the specific complete filename works. I have no idea what the cause could be.\n\nLog-files don't show anything.\n\nMapping of the index in question:\n\n```\n{\n    \"stats-2014.11.16\": {\n        \"mappings\": {\n            \"resource\": {\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"@timestamp\": {\n                        \"type\": \"date\",\n                        \"format\": \"dateOptionalTime\"\n                    },\n                    \"domain\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                    },\n                    \"dur\": {\n                        \"type\": \"long\"\n                    },\n                    \"exec\": {\n                        \"type\": \"long\"\n                    },\n                    \"filename\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                    },\n                    \"node\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                    },\n                    \"recv\": {\n                        \"type\": \"long\"\n                    },\n                    \"size\": {\n                        \"type\": \"long\"\n                    },\n                    \"start\": {\n                        \"type\": \"long\"\n                    },\n                    \"status\": {\n                        \"type\": \"long\"\n                    },\n                    \"url\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
