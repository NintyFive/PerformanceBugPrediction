This means that if no new cluster change event happens, the check never gets reevaluated for the remaining delayed shards.\n\nHowever, assuming shard A is actually assigned there will be a new cluster change event (a shard started event), so that's why this doesn't look like it occurs very frequently.\n\nI think perhaps we can remove the \n\n``` java\n        if (event.source().startsWith(CLUSTER_UPDATE_TASK_SOURCE)) {\n            // that's us, ignore this event\n            return;\n        }\n```\n\nFrom the cluster changed event, what do you think?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
