Part of how it works is by grouping field types into families of fields: conflicts are fine as long as the types across indices are all of the same family.\r\n\r\nShould we move this logic to `_field_caps` instead?\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how we could collapse fields:\r\n - `number`: `long`, `integer`, `double`, `float`, `scaled_float`, ...\r\n - `date`: `date`, `date_nanos`\r\n - `keyword`: `keyword`, `constant_keyword`, `wildcard`\r\n - `text`: `text`\r\n - `geo`: `geo_point`, `geo_shape`\r\n\r\nMost other fields would be their own family as they don't share properties with other fields, e.g. `boolean` or `flattened`.\r\n\r\nSo for instance, the below response today is considered a conflict:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"indices\": [\"index1\", \"index2\", \"index3\", \"index4\", \"index5\"],\r\n    \"fields\": {\r\n        \"rating\": { \r\n            \"double\": {\r\n                \"searchable\": true,\r\n                \"aggregatable\": true,\r\n                \"indices\": [\"index1\", \"index2\"]\r\n            },\r\n            \"float\": {\r\n                \"searchable\": true,\r\n                \"aggregatable\": true,\r\n                \"indices\": [\"index3\", \"index4\"],\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile it wouldn't be one if we collapsed `double` and `float` into a `number` \"family\".","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
