This slows down apt-get operations to the point where it is unusable. When I checked the file it had 500+ lines already.\r\n\r\nI would suggest changing this to:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho \"deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list\r\n```\r\n\r\nwithout the `-a` or to:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho \"deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe one issue I can see with this approach is if there is a usecase for this file to contain more than one line. In that case, maybe use separate files for each entry.\r\n\r\nNote. created the ticket after discussion here: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/minor-problem-with-documentation-for-es-debian-installation/200172","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
