Executing a request built like that leads to a SearchPhaseExecutionException:\n\n```\n...Parse Failure [Unknown key for a START_ARRAY in [topHitsAgg]: [fields].]];\n```\n\nI think this is misleading. I see two options to avoid this confusion:\n- the top_hits API allows setting \"fields\" (at least to an empty array)\n- the Java API does not offer this method\n\nIt is obviously not a big problem, I just stumbled over this and thought it's worth mentioning. I tested this behavior with ES 1.4.1 and 1.5.0.
