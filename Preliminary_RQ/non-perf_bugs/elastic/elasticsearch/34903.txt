One needs to look into their internals but even then there are aggs where it's ambiguous whether any computation has happened or if it's just the default value (as aggs use primitives, there's no `null`).\r\nTake `SUM` and `MAX`; if there's nothing to compute, `SUM` returns `0` while `MAX` returns `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`. The latter might be used but `0` is a valid sum so the caller has no idea whether its meaning is `null` or actually `0`.\r\n\r\nSee #34896","closed_by":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
