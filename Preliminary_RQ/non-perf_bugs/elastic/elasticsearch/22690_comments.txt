If you are using the transport client have a look at the documentation for [`_delete_by_query`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/current/java-docs-delete-by-query.html) which uses the same pattern as `_update_by_query`. If not, look [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update-by-query.html).\r\n\r\nIf you are embedding Elasticsearch inside of another java process then stop. That isn't supported so it isn't going to work well and is known to have trouble with the modules.\r\n\r\nLastly, next time ask questions like this (those that probably aren't bugs) on discuss.elastic.co","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/273966674","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22690#issuecomment-273966674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22690","id":273966674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Mzk2NjY3NA==","user":{"login":"wenthywang","id":15195159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTk1MTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15195159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenthywang","html_url":"https://github.com/wenthywang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenthywang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenthywang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenthywang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenthywang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenthywang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenthywang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenthywang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenthywang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenthywang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-20T03:12:57Z","updated_at":"2017-01-20T03:12:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank you....","performed_via_github_app":null}]
