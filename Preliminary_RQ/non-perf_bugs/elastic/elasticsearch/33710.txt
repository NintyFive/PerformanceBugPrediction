the feature:\r\n\r\nElasticsearch version (bin/elasticsearch --version):6.4.0\r\n\r\nPlugins installed: []\r\n\r\nJVM version (java -version): 1.8.0_181\"\r\n\r\nWindows, Docker

word_delimiter.\r\n\r\naccording with this ticket\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28474\r\n\r\nChanging the word_delimiter to word_delimiter_graph should fix the problem.\r\nbut i changed and the problem remains.\r\n\r\nAnalyzer:\r\n\r\n\"nameAnalyzer\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"custom\",\r\n            \"filter\": [\"lowercase\",\r\n              \"trim\",\r\n
