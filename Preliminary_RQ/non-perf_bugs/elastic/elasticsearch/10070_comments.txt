This bug is about the fact that the documentation for `ignore_malformed` is incorrect and misleading. Just because the particular example referenced here (long vs. other numerics) was addressed, doesn't mean the problem went away (for example, it remains with strings vs. objects, etc). At minimum, there should be a warning in the documentation for `ignore_malformed` that it only applies in a narrow range of circumstances and does not ensure the document will get indexed.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/343277039","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10070#issuecomment-343277039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10070","id":343277039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MzI3NzAzOQ==","user":{"login":"rparkhunovskyi","id":6543422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDM0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6543422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparkhunovskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/rparkhunovskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparkhunovskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparkhunovskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparkhunovskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparkhunovskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparkhunovskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparkhunovskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparkhunovskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparkhunovskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparkhunovskyi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-09T20:11:33Z","updated_at":"2017-11-09T20:11:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Agree on that it should have not been closed.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/343348606","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10070#issuecomment-343348606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10070","id":343348606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MzM0ODYwNg==","user":{"login":"zzbennett","id":1134147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1134147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzbennett","html_url":"https://github.com/zzbennett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzbennett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzbennett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzbennett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzbennett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzbennett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzbennett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzbennett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzbennett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzbennett/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-10T01:37:18Z","updated_at":"2017-11-10T01:37:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1 I was burned by the fact that there are a lot of situations that `ignore_malformed` doesn't apply to (fields containing consecutive dots in the field name, objects vs. concrete values) ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/348383463","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10070#issuecomment-348383463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10070","id":348383463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODM4MzQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"iamejboy","id":25651955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjUxOTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25651955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamejboy","html_url":"https://github.com/iamejboy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamejboy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamejboy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamejboy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamejboy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamejboy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamejboy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamejboy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamejboy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamejboy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-01T02:26:31Z","updated_at":"2017-12-01T02:26:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1","performed_via_github_app":null}]
