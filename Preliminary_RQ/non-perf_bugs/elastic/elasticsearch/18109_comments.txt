I'll put some rough notes here about what I recall about these package formats --\n\nThis is made annoying because both Debian and Red Hat have different mechanisms for this. In RPM, you'll want a \"postun\" (for after removing a package) or a \"preun\" (before removing a package). In Debian, you'll want a \"postrm\" or \"prerm\" script. Further, I think each have different special ways of handling upgrades (which, in a way, is a package removal). Finally, Debian has two concepts for package removal -- \"remove\" and \"purge\". Fun!\n\nHope this helps. :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
