In order to accomplish this, a user may want to use the `searchable_snapshot` action in the hot phase.\r\n\r\nWe should add the searchable snapshot action to the hot phase for ILM, with the following caveats:\r\n\r\nWe should prevent policies from being added or updated that configure incompatible actions post-searchable snapshot, this includes `force_merge`, `shrink`, and potentially `freeze` (we should determine whether freeze is incompatible or not).\r\n\r\nEither as part of this work or in a followup, we should enhance the existing incompatible actions to handle the situation where a searchable snapshot index enters the action. For example, if a user manually mounted an index and then ILM was to try and shrink it, we should not put the index permanently into an ERROR step because we can never shrink the searchable snapshot.","closed_by":{"login":"andreidan","id":1217601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1217601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan","html_url":"https://github.com/andreidan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
