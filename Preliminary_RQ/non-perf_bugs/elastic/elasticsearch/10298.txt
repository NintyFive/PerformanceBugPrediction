I have documents that all have unique ids labeled \"request-id\". The request id, identifies related sets of log documents. For example, a start request would have the same `request-id` as it's end request counter part, and all logs in between.\n\nI need to find end requests that have a status of 500, then query the documents by the `request-id` and find their related logs and show this in the results instead of only the end requests with status of 500.\n\nI've been reading about parent-child queries, but I'm having trouble formulating a proper query that yields the results I'm seeking. Does anyone have any insight on how to make this happen?\n\nTo summarize, the query would be something like this:\n1) `Parent`: find all documents with statusCode = 500\n2) find all documents with `request-id == Parent.request-id`, show results.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
