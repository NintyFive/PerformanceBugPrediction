There were no intersections here either but ES seemed to not like the value 180.0.  There are still a few shapes which won't go in. I have investigated to see if there are any intersections and can't find any. Translating the shape to meridian using +180 on -ve values and -180 on +ve values allows it to go in so it is solely a dateline issue. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1.
