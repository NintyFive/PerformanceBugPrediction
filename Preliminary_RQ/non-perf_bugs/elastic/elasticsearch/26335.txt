My question is:\r\n\r\nShould the  search preference `_primary` take the primary relocation target into account?\r\nPut differently, should `OperationRouting.preferenceActiveShardIterator(...)` return the primary relocation target as backup when specifying `_primary` preference?\r\n\r\nNote that the default search preference always takes relocation targets into account (and puts them last together with the \"regular\" initializing shards).\r\n\r\nRelated question:\r\n\r\nShould the search preference `_replica` also take replica relocation targets into account? \r\n\r\nMore background to this:\r\n\r\nThere was a test failure of SearchWhileCreatingIndexIT which illustrates the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+master+g1gc/4012/consoleFull\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
