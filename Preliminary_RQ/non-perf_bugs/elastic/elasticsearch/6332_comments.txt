To me the issue is that is if you have very large field data, this would actually make sense to make sure you never go out of memory but on the other hand if you rely on doc values, this makes you waste memory. I heard @dakrone is working on a way to share memory across several breakers, I think it would help for that issue?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/44423836","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6332#issuecomment-44423836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6332","id":44423836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDIzODM2","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-28T15:40:33Z","updated_at":"2014-05-28T15:40:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, currently I have a POC I'm working on for a CircuitBreakerService that has child circuit breakers (for example, one for fielddata and one for BigArrays/requests) and when a circuit break happens on one breaker, it can \"borrow\" space from another breaker if there is memory available within configurable minimums and maximums.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/44820521","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6332#issuecomment-44820521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6332","id":44820521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODIwNTIx","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-02T10:05:15Z","updated_at":"2014-06-02T10:05:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kevinkluge I opened a separate pull request to deal with the default breaker value: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/6375\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
