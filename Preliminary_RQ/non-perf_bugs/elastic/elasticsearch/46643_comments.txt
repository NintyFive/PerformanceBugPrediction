If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nRegarding your issue the error message says that you should use `POST` and not `PUT` to update a setting so I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
