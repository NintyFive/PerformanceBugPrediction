The 'typeless' reindex + index APIs were only added in 7.0 and are not yet available in 6.x. So when the type is omitted for the destination index, reindex still uses the old behavior where the type is taken from documents in the `_source` index. In 7.0, omitting the type is interpreted as a 'typeless' call, so there is no type conflict error.\r\n\r\nI noticed in the [removal of types documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/removal-of-types.html) that we forget to specify the destination type when reindexing. This is probably causing confusion, I opened #45118 to address it.\r\n\r\nThe behavior on 6.x is quite subtle, but I hope that the correction to the documentation will make it clearer for users what to do. We also have a blog post which goes through the 7.0 upgrade steps in detail: https://www.elastic.co/blog/moving-from-types-to-typeless-apis-in-elasticsearch-7-0","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/528948431","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43100#issuecomment-528948431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43100","id":528948431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODk0ODQzMQ==","user":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T17:44:08Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T17:44:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm going to close out this issue, thanks for raising it as it led to an important clarification in the docs.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
