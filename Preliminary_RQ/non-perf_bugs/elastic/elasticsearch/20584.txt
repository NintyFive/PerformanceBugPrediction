However, I noticed that elasticsearch doesn't respect this value, even though the docs say it should be possible (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html). Note that I can call the update api (/_settings) and do it and it works that way, however, for puppet, it has to be done in the elasticsearch.yml file.\nI noticed that I can change other settings in that file and it works (e.g. setting number of shards, replicas).\nThis also happened in 1.4.4.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Download Elasticsearch 2.4\n2. set index.refresh_interval: -1 in elasticsearch.yml and start elasticsearch.\n3. created a new index\n   1. looked up the settings, (curl ..../_settings)\n   2. index.refresh_interval isn't there.\n   3. Inserting a document is immediately searchable, even though the setting means it shouldn't be.\n   4. calling curl -XPUT ../_settings 'index.refresh_interval: -1' works and immediately takes effect.\n\n<!--\nIf you are filing a feature request, please remove the above bug\nreport block and provide responses for all of the below items.\n-->\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
