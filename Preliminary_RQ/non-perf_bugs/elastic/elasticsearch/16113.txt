If a node which has a copy of the original primary shard (including data) rejoins the cluster later on, that data will be deleted: the old shard copy will be replaced by the new live shard copy.\n\nIf there are no applicable replicas to promote and a user force allocates the primary, we will then create a new replica containing the same amount of data as this new primary (ie probably empty).\n\nBut if we had a copy of the replica on another unavailable node - eg if we had multiple nodes drop out that happened to have the primary and replica of the same shard - I presume we also ignore the old replica? Should we update this warning to include this?\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
