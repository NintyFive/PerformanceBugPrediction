so the test failed because it happened to query the job when it had moved into the `INDEXING` state, which is sorta like a subset of the `STARTED` state.\r\n\r\nIdeally this would be fixed with a regex that checks `(STARTED|INDEXING)`, but there are some regex issues with yaml tests right now.  I'll open an issue about that in a few.\r\n\r\nI think this can be fixed by just setting the job cron to run in a prior year (e.g. to never run) which will make sure we never actually move to `INDEXING` during the tests.  Will push a fix to the relevant branches in a minute","performed_via_github_app":null}]
