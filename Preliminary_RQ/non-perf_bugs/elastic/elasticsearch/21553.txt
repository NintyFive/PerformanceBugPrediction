Installed, setup, ran with data going to the \"service\" field.\r\n 2.  After close to two days, data starts to go to the \"service.keyword\" field (by design)\r\n 3.  After creating a new index automatically (found this out via logs), data went back to the \"service\" field.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\nSome reference links:\r\n[https://discuss.elastic.co/t/beta-fielddata/64332/5](url)\r\n[https://discuss.elastic.co/t/data-stopped-going-to-keyword-field/65871](url)\r\n\r\nDevs, please let me know if you'd like me to put the screenshots and data from the second Discuss link which has all the information...thought I would save time/space.  Also, this is a dev environment that I can totally restart from scratch (again) for figuring out this issue.
