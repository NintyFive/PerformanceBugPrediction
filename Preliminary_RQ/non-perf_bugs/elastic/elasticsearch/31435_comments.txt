The in flight breaker is solely for network layer stuff (it could basically be the `NETTY_BREAKER`)\r\n\r\nPersonally I think it's nice to have both, since any resources used and released can use the requests breaker, and the in flight request breaker can be *solely* for network stuff while having different limits.
