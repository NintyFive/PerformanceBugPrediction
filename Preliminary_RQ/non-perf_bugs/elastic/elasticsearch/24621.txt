Create index `foo-1` with alias `read`\r\n2. Create index `foo-2` with aliases `read` and `write`.\r\n3. Index a doc in `foo-1`\r\n4. Index a doc in `foo-2`\r\n5. Search `/read,-foo-2/_search`\r\n\r\n**Observations**\r\n\r\nMy expectation was to only see results from `foo-1`. However, the request fails with `IndexNotFoundException` for index `-foo-2`.\r\n\r\nNote that trying `/read*,-foo-2/_search` works.\r\n\r\nAlso, trying `/read*,-write/_search` does not work (index `-write` doesn't exist), but `/read*,-write*/_search` works.\r\n\r\n**Versions**\r\n\r\nI've tested this on master (v6, commit 2486086980663bce5ff25f5ed7eb25d6a2cfc7c7).
