Setup an index for rollover\n2. Create an empty index having a name matching the next `new_index` after rollover\n3. Execute `_rollover?dry_run`.\n4. Execute `_rollover`.\n\n```\nGET packetbeat/_aliases\n{\n  \"packetbeat-000004\": {\n    \"aliases\": {\n      \"packetbeat\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\nPUT packetbeat-000005\n{\n  \"acknowledged\": true,\n  \"shards_acknowledged\": true\n}\n```\n\nNormally this is a 7 day rollover. Set it to 0 day (or remove the condition entirely) to just execute it:\n\n```\nPOST packetbeat/_rollover?dry_run\n{\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"max_age\": \"0d\"\n  }\n}\n\n{\n  \"old_index\": \"packetbeat-000004\",\n  \"new_index\": \"packetbeat-000005\",\n  \"rolled_over\": false,\n  \"dry_run\": true,\n  \"acknowledged\": false,\n  \"shards_acknowledged\": false,\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"[max_age: 0s]\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI would have expected the dry run to indicate failure.\n\nThe actual rollover fails as expected:\n\n```\nPOST packetbeat/_rollover\n{\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"max_age\": \"0d\"\n  }\n}\n\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"root_cause\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"index_already_exists_exception\",\n        \"reason\": \"index [packetbeat-000005/0FDcEuIQTh6lVvD-l7lkxg] already exists\",\n        \"index_uuid\": \"0FDcEuIQTh6lVvD-l7lkxg\",\n        \"index\": \"packetbeat-000005\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"type\": \"index_already_exists_exception\",\n    \"reason\": \"index [packetbeat-000005/0FDcEuIQTh6lVvD-l7lkxg] already exists\",\n    \"index_uuid\": \"0FDcEuIQTh6lVvD-l7lkxg\",\n    \"index\": \"packetbeat-000005\"\n  },\n  \"status\": 400\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
