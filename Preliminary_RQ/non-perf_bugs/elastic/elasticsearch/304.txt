The script execution will include the `term` variable which is the current field term used.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"match_all\" : {  }\n    },\n    \"facets\" : {\n        \"tag\" : {\n            \"terms\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"tag\",\n                \"size\" : 10,\n                \"script\" : \"term + 'aaa'\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd using the boolean feature:\n\n```\n{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"match_all\" : {  }\n    },\n    \"facets\" : {\n        \"tag\" : {\n            \"terms\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"tag\",\n                \"size\" : 10,\n                \"script\" : \"term == 'aaa' ? true : false\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
