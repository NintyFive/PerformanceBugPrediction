In particular, the type name is included in the mapping definition, and when communicating over REST, the parameter `include_type_name=true` is specified.\r\n\r\nWhen we soon deprecate the typed put + get templates calls on master, this will result in us issuing deprecation warnings when the monitoring `http` exporter is used. This won't be a great experience for users, as they'll receive deprecation warnings that are out of their control to fix. Note that if the `http` exporter needs to be able to connect to a 6.7 cluster, then `include_type_name` should be explicitly provided and set to `false`, since `include_type_name` defaults to `true` in 6.7 (whereas on master it defaults to `false`).","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
