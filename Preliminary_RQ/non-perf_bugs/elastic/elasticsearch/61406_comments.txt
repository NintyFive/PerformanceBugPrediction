Adding support for additional processor architectures is not something we [undertake lightly](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/54930#issuecomment-610690848) since it entails a good deal of ongoing effort in testing and maintenance. If we were to add support for MIPS then we would consider this a bug, but as things currently stand it's an expected incompatibility. As there is no action for us to take here, I am closing this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/678104178","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/61406#issuecomment-678104178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/61406","id":678104178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODEwNDE3OA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T08:03:01Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T08:03:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra (:Core/Infra/Core)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
