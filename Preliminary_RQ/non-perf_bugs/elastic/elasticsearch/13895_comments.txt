This feels like it should be handled in a query pre-processing phase before sending the query to Elasticsearch.\n\nFor the concrete example of converting the CIDR to a range, there is this issue that has been open for a while https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7464. Nobody has implemented it yet, but we'd be in favour of implementing it if you'd like to send a PR.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
