version: 2.2.0\n\nJVM version: 1.8.0_74\n\nOS version: Ubuntu 14.04\n\nI'm running this query:\n\n```\n{\n  \"sort\": {\n    \"timestamp\": {\n      \"order\": \"desc\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"size\":

\"timestamp\": {\n      \"order\": \"desc\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"size\": 100,\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"and\": [\n          {\n            \"nested\": {\n

different results.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
