Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. \r\n\r\nIn this particular case, please note:\r\n> Received message from unsupported version: [2.0.0] minimal compatible version is: [5.6.0] \r\n\r\nThis means that something (a node or a client node) talking the protocol of version 2.0.0 is trying to talk to a node in a 6.1.4 cluster. This is not supported. The latest version that can interact with any 6.x version is 5.6.0.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
