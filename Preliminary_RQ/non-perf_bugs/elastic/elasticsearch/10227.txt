That is, the \"old\" way of computing coordinate orientation for polygons (which is not compliant with OGC standards and will fail on ambiguous polygon).  Requested by the community, this option would be in the form of: `orientation: ignore` to provide backwards compatibility with projects that handle their own coordinate orientation logic (or already provide shapes in a manner than skirts orientation issues prior to ES 1.4.3).\n\nNote that if a user opts to ignore orientation and an ambiguous polygon is provided, InvalidShapeExceptions will occur - this is the price the user is willing to pay.  \n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
