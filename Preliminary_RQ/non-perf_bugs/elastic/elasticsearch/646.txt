Hunspell dictionaries will be picked up from a dedicated hunspell directory on the filesystem (defaults to _<path.conf>_/hunspell). Each dictionary is expected to have its own directory named after its associated locale (language). This dictionary directory is expected to hold both the *.aff and *.dic files (all of which will automatically be picked up). For example, assuming the default hunspell location is used, the following directory layout will define the _en_US_ dictionary:\n\n```\n- conf\n    |-- hunspell \n    |    |-- en_US\n    |    |    |-- en_US.dic\n    |    |    |-- en_US.aff\n```\n\nThe location of the hunspell directory can be configured using the `indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.location` settings in _elasticsearch.yml_.\n\nEach dictionary can be configured with two settings:\n- `ignore_case` - If true, dictionary matching will be case insensitive (defaults to `false`)\n- `strict_affix_parsing` - Determines whether errors while reading a affix rules file will cause exception or simple be ignored (defaults to `true`)\n\nThese settings can be configured globally in `elasticsearch.yml` using `indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.ignore_case` and `indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.strict_affix_parsing`, or for specific dictionaries: `indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.en_US.ignore_case` and `indices.analysis.hunspell.dictionary.en_US.strict_affix_parsing`.\n\nIt is also possible to add `settings.yml` file under the dictionary directory which holds these settings (this will override any other settings defined in the `elasticsearch.yml`).\n\nOne can use the hunspell stem filter by configuring it the analysis settings:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"analysis\" : {\n        \"analyzer\" : {\n            \"en\" : {\n                \"tokenizer\" : \"standard\",       \n                \"filter\" : [ \"lowercase\", \"en_US\" ]\n            }\n        },\n        \"filter\" : {\n            \"en_US\" : {\n                \"type\" : \"hunspell\",\n                \"locale\" : \"en_US\",\n                \"dedup\" : true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n## Original Request:\n\nHunspell is a spell checker and morphological analyzer designed for languages with rich morphology and complex word compounding and character encoding.\n\n[1] Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunspell\n\n[2] Source code, http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/\n\n[3] Hunspell-Lucene integration, http://code.google.com/p/lucene-hunspell/\n\n[4] presentation by Chris Male, EuroCon 2010, http://lucene-eurocon.org/slides/European-Language-Analysis-with-Hunspell_Chris-Male.pdf (annotation of his talk can be found here: http://lucene-eurocon.org/sessions-track2-day2.html#5)\n","closed_by":{"login":"uboness","id":211019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTAxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/211019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness","html_url":"https://github.com/uboness","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uboness/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
