We prefer to keep GitHub issues only for confirmed bug reports and feature requests. Please could you open a thread on the forum with your question?\r\n\r\nAlso please don't post screenshots of text. They're impossible to search or quote in a response and are unreadable by those of us who use screen-readers. Instead just copy the text and format it appropriately.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
