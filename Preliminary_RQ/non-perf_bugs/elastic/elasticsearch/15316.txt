What I think is missing is:\n1.  an aggregation for the Duration (min - max) timestamp of a group. \n2.  more specific options for inclusion in the group:\n- starts_with field=value or field=regex_pattern\n- ends_with field=value  or field=regex_pattern\n- contains field=value or field=regex_pattern ## to report on subset of transactions that took a particular path or went through a particular host, etc.\n\nKibana's Visualization editor would need:\n- An Additional Data Constraints section (in addition to metrics and buckets) which would solicit the starts_with, ends_with, and contains field and value.\n- the metrics Aggregation lookup would need to include \"Duration\"\n\nWith these added I think ELK users would be in a much better position to report on business transactions across complex heterogeneous stacks out of the box (without custom development). \n\nThoughts?\n","closed_by":{"login":"rferrante1966","id":6255319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6255319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rferrante1966","html_url":"https://github.com/rferrante1966","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rferrante1966/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rferrante1966/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rferrante1966/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rferrante1966/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rferrante1966/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rferrante1966/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rferrante1966/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rferrante1966/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rferrante1966/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
