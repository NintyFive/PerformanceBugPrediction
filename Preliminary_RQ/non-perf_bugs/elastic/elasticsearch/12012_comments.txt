I suggest:\n- reindexing your `userindex` to a new index (just in case)\n- try to optimize the `userindex` (to rewrite any bad segments)\n- make a fresh snapshot\n- try to restore it... hopefully this will work\n\nA number of corruption problems have been fixed in recent versions. You should upgrade as soon as possible.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
