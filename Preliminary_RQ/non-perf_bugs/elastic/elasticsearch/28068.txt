[49] [50] *51* [52] [53] ... [121] [122] [123]`\r\n\r\nCurrently jumping to page `49` or `53` is impossible without either retrieving too many results or specifying large value for `\"from\"`. If we allowed `\"from\"` with `\"search_after\"` users could implement efficient searches to retrieve any page displayed:\r\n\r\n- `[1]`,  `[2]`, `[3]` by using simple pagination (setting `\"from\"` to `0`, `10`, and `20` respectively)\r\n- `[121]`, `[122]`, `[123]` by reversing the sort orders for all fields, using simple pagination and then reversing the returned hits in app\r\n- `[52]`, `[53]` by setting `\"search_after\"` to the `sort` value of the last hit on page 51 and using simple pagination\r\n- `[49]`, `[50]` by reversing sort, setting `\"search_after\"` to the `sort` value of the first hit on page 51, using simple pagination and then reversing the returned hits in app\r\n\r\nThat way *any* page can be calculated cheaply and no deep pagination will be required. The largest size of hits to be sorted would be (N+1)*PAGE_SIZE where N is the number of page links displayed to either side of current page.\r\n  ","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
