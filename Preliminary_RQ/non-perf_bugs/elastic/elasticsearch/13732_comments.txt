The avg is not computed as the avg of the scores like\n\n```\n(x1*w1 + x2*w2 + ... + xn*wn)/(n)\n```\n\nbut instead we compute the weighted average:\n\n```\n(x1*w1 + x2*w2 + ... + xn*wn)/(w1 + w2 + ... + wn)\n```\n\nThis was changed here: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/9004\nThe weighted average in a way computes the regular average of the `x`s without the weights but _pulls_ it a little closer to values that have a high weight.\n\nI drew an image to explain what the weighted average does:\n\n![avg-explain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4320215/10306908/7e259de6-6c2a-11e5-8ff9-12bb05f542c8.jpg)\n\nIt seems counterintuitive at first but it seems to make more sense and so far we only had a request for the weighted average but none for plain average.
