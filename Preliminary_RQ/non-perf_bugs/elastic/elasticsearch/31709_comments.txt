However, we think that SSDs are common enough these days that our default should be tuned to that use-case. We [document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/index-modules-merge.html#merge-scheduling) that if you're on spinning disks then this setting needs to be tuned down to one.\r\n\r\nPlease note in the future that we prefer for user questions to be addressed on the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co). This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests and we put this in our issue template.
