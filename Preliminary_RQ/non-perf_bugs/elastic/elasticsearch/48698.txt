a mixed cluster environment, when a 6.8 node is a master it will send out a cluster state update where a mapping has a pattern with an` 8 prefix` (i.e. 8E, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z) it will then be applied on 7.x node. \r\nIt will work for the first cluster state update, but on the second update it will notice a difference as  it will strip the `8` and will compare the `8E, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` received vs `E, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` As in reality the mapping has not changed, it will have same version. \r\nThis is causing the assertion in `MappingService` to fail\r\n```\r\n  if (currentIndexMetaData.getMappingVersion() == newIndexMetaData.getMappingVersion()) {\r\n                // if the mapping version is unchanged, then there should not be any updates and all mappings should be the same\r\n                assert updatedEntries.isEmpty() : updatedEntries;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be fixed and the original date format should be retained, but the stripped format should be used on the enclosed java.time `DateTimeFormatter`\r\n\r\nThis is failing at the moment on
