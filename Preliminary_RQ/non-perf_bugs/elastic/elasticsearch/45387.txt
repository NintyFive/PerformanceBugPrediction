The job was successfully created and the rollup index started filling with data. However, _rollup_search returns no data (sum/max/etc all come back as null) and on investigation the rollup index has no rollup meta data and GET /*/_rollup/data returns an empty object. I've created other simple indexes and rollup jobs on the cluster and they all come out the same. It seem like the rollup indexes is not being recognized as such, even though the task is running and adding rollup data.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kandelon","id":20399737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzk5NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/20399737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kandelon","html_url":"https://github.com/kandelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kandelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kandelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kandelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kandelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kandelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kandelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kandelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kandelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kandelon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
