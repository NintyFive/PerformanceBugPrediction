The loggers often go down to the class level and even if we detail the loggers at the package level there will be a lot of them and they are subject to change constantly (not just in minor versions). This poses two problems, firstly by documenting them it would set an expectation of backwards compatibility of these loggers which we could not keep in and practical way and secondly it would be hard to impossible to ensure that the documentation of the loggers and the actual loggers used do not diverge. For this reason and because this issue has been open for over a year without gathering much interested I'm going to close it.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
