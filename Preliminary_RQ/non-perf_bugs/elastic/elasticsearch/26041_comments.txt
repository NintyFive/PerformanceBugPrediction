This is a known bug in Lucene:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-7551\r\nThe support for FVH has decreased in Lucene and efforts are made towards the unified highlighter now. This highlighter is available since 5.5 in es (and is the default in 6), works with fast vectors and handles phrase query with stop words efficiently:\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/search-request-highlighting.html#unified-highlighter\r\n\r\nI'll close this issue as won't fix, the resolution is to use the `unified` highlighter.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
