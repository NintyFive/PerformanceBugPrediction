For example, it's like this in NodeBuilder\n\n``` java\n/**\n     * Is the node a local node. A local node is a node that uses a local (JVM level) discovery and\n     * transport. Other (local) nodes started within the same JVM (actually, class-loader) will be\n     * discovered and communicated with. Nodes outside of the JVM will not be discovered.\n     *\n     * @param local Should the node be local or not\n     */\n    public NodeBuilder local(boolean local) {\n        settings.put(\"node.local\", local);\n        return this;\n    }\n\n```\n\nShouldn't it be more specific such as \n\n``` java\n    public NodeBuilder local() {\n        settings.put(\"node.local\", true);\n        return this;\n    }\n```\n\nAnd then we have default value to be put in node() method as I'm confused every time what flag go against what function. Just an idea to discuss with the community and to learn as well. If it's ok I can do a pull request.\n\nThanks.\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
