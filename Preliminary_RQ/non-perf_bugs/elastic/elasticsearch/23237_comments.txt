Issued: March 2004</label> --></em></p>\\n<p>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued full guidance to the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on computed tomography-guided thermocoagulation of osteoid osteoma.</p>\\n<h2>Description</h2>\\n<p>This procedure can be performed under intravenous sedation or general anesthesia and involves the use of CT guidance.</p>\\n<p>Step one is to localise the lesion with CT. A trephine bone biopsy needle is then introduced into the lesion. The needle (or sometimes a drill) is then used to create an entry hole through the bone. CT is used to monitor the progress of the needle to ensure placement near the tumour.</p>\\n<p>The core of the lesion is then removed with the inner trephine needle for biopsy, and a radiofrequency electrode probe is introduced into the centre of the nidus. The probe is then heated to 85-90 degrees&nbsp;centrigrade for 4-6 minutes. The whole procedure takes around 90 minutes. After removal of the electrode, patients are scanned by CT to assess the outcome of the procedure.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/nice-guidance/nice-interventional-procedures-guidance/coding-recommendations\\\">Coding</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/IPG53/resources\\\">clinical classification codes</a> for this guidance</p> <div class=\\\"book\\\" title=\\\"Computed tomography-guided thermocoagulation of osteoid osteoma\\\" xmlns=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\\\">\\n  <h1 class=\\\"title\\\">\\n    <a id=\\\"ID0EC\\\"></a>Computed tomography-guided thermocoagulation of osteoid osteoma</h1>\\n  <div class=\\\"chapter\\\" title=\\\"1 Guidance\\\">\\n    <h2 class=\\\"title\\\">\\n      <a id=\\\"guidance\\\"></a>1 Guidance</h2>\\n    <p class=\\\"numbered-paragraph\\\">\\n      <span class=\\\"paragraph-number\\\">1.1 </span>Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of computed tomography (CT)-guided thermocoagulation of osteoid osteoma appears adequate to support its use, provided that the normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance. </p>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\\\"chapter\\\" title=\\\"2 The procedure\\\">\\n    <h2 class=\\\"title\\\">\\n      <a id=\\\"the-procedure\\\"></a>2 The procedure</h2>\\n    <div class=\\\"section\\\" title=\\\"2.1 Indications\\\">\\n      <h3 class=\\\"title\\\">\\n        <a id=\\\"indications\\\"></a>2.1 Indications</h3>\\n      <p class=\\\"numbered-paragraph\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"paragraph-number\\\">2.1.1 </span>Osteoid osteomas are benign, bone-forming tumours that occur most frequently in the legs, especially in the femur and tibia. </p>\\n      <p class=\\\"numbered-paragraph\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"paragraph-number\\\">2.1.2 </span>Almost all patients have pain as a result of the tumour. Other symptoms include growth disturbances, bony deformity, scoliosis and, if located within a joint, swelling, synovitis, restricted movement and contracture. This condition may regress spontaneously, but the resolution of symptoms is unpredictable and may take months or years. </p>\\n      <p class=\\\"numbered-paragraph\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"paragraph-number\\\">2.1.3 </span>Standard treatment initially focuses on pain management using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients who continue to have pain or who experience other tumour-related complications are offered surgical excision. Surgery requires a hospital stay of several days and the patient cannot undertake weight-bearing activity for a substantial period of time. Aggressive resection carries the risk of postoperative fracture, infection and haematoma. </p>\\n      <p class=\\\"numbered-paragraph\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"paragraph-number\\\">2.1.4 </span>In recent years several minimally invasive techniques using imaging, such as percutaneous resection and radiofrequency ablation, have been introduced in patients with osteoid osteoma in order to achieve removal or destruction of the tumour without the subsequent morbidity of standard surgical treatment.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"section\\\" title=\\\"2.2 Outline of the procedure\\\">\\n      <h3 class=\\\"title\\\">\\n        <a id=\\\"outline-of-the-procedure\\\"></a>2.2 Outline of the procedure</h3>\\n      <p class=\\\"numbered-paragraph\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"paragraph-number\\\">2.2.1 </span>In this procedure, the lesion is located using computed tomography (CT). Under general anaesthetic, an entry hole is created through the bone using a fine drill. A radiofrequency electrode probe is introduced into the centre of the osteoma and heated. The electrode is then removed and a CT scan is done later to assess the outcome of the procedure</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"section\\\" title=\\\"2.3 Efficacy\\\">\\n      <h3 class=\\\"title\\\">\\n        <a id=\\\"efficacy\\\"></a>2.3 Efficacy</h3>\\n      <p class=\\\"numbered-paragraph\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"paragraph-number\\\">2.3.1 </span>Resolution of pain was the main outcome reported in the studies. In a case series of 97 consecutive patients with a mean follow up of 41 months, 76% (74/97) of patients reported a good response after one treatment session and 92% (89/97) reported a good response after one or two sessions. In the smaller studies, resolution of symptoms was reported by 82–95% of patients at final follow up.
