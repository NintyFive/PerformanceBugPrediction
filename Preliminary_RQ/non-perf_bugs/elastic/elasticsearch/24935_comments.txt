the same test fails twice it does not mean that it has the same cause as the first failure. I think that it's best to not reopen an old issue for a test failure unless the cause is definitively the same as the initial failure that was being tracked. I'm inclined to think that the failure is something different here since this has not failed at all from May 29 until July 11. This leads me to believe that something new tickled this test and caused this failure. I logged into the slave to capture the build logs but sadly they are already destroyed. I'm going to close this issue. If this occurs again, please capture the cause and open a new issue (unless it's genuinely the same cause).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
