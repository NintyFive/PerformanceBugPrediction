You're running into the [heap size check](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/_heap_size_check.html) and the [minimum master nodes check](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/_minimum_master_nodes_check.html). It looks like you already figured out to set `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` but I do not see any indication that you also tuned the heap size? You need configure the minimum heap size to be equal to the maximum heap size if Elasticsearch is reachable via an external network interface.\n\n> and then i decide to set : \n> **discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 2**\n> \n> the same error cames up.\n\nAre you sure that that is what happened? If so, can you please provide a reproduction? I would have expected that the minimum master nodes bootstrap check would be passing and that you would only see an error on the heap size bootstrap check failing.\n\nAlso, note that you should only set it to two if you have three master-eligible nodes (and you should never have exactly two master-eligible nodes).\n\nPlease note that Elastic reserves GitHub for verified bug reports and feature requests.
