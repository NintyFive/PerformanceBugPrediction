One cluster (lets say it has name : \"data-cluster\") with three nodes (for simplicity all running on same machine but different ports)\n           a. localhost:9200\n           b. localhost:9400\n           c. localhost:9600\n2. Another cluster (\"monitoring-cluster\") with two nodes\n          a. localhost:8200\n          b: localhost:8400\n\nAll nodes in both cluster have marvel installed and are accessible on their respective ports with correct cluster health reports.\n\nHowever, to have dedicated monitoring stats all nodes on \"data-cluster\" are configured to send stats to \"monitoring-cluster\" ( as mentioned in docs : http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/marvel/current/configuration.html )\n\nBelow is the configuration on each node of \"data-cluster\": \n\nmarvel.agent.exporter.es.hosts: [\"192.168.2.32:8200\", \"192.168.2.32:8400\"]\n\nEven after this configuraton, the marvel UI on \"monitoring cluster\" doesn't show nodes and indices of \"data-cluster\"\n\nAm i missing something?
