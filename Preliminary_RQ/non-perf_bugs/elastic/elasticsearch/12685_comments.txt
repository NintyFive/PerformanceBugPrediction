As soon as the \"wrong\" shard moves to another node, everything breaks.\n\nThese issues have been fixed in 2.0 with https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8870.\n\nTo resolve this now:\n- make sure you have no conflicting field names (the migration plugin can help you to identify this problem: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-migration)\n- if that doesn't work, try putting your mapping explicitly (when you create the index) and reindex your data\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/128346690","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12685#issuecomment-128346690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12685","id":128346690,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODM0NjY5MA==","user":{"login":"zhangwei17","id":2209809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDk4MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2209809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangwei17","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangwei17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangwei17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangwei17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangwei17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangwei17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangwei17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangwei17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangwei17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangwei17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangwei17/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-06T12:22:36Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T12:22:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot!\nFinally we found that the problem will appear when field names with different core types are defined in multi types within current index.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
