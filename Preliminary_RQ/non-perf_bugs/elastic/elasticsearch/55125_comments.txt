First, it is a consistent, simple url pattern that we can control. In the past we have been burned by the url pattern changing on us (as can be seen in the special cases in JdkDownloadPlugin). Second, it is a caching layer, where just our builds (in theory at least) consume this URL. We have had a lot of trouble with external services wreaking havoc in our CI since even a few minutes hiccup can propagate to dozens of failed builds that must be investigated. Third, when we originally started using adoptopenjdk, the download links redirected to github, which did not support HEAD requests, and this broke our use of pulling the artifact through Gradle's dependency management.\r\n\r\nInternally, we have a \"jvm catalog\" that is used within CI, and it is our intention to eventually use that, either directly or indirectly (some jvm licenses make exposing them, even just for testing, tricky!). While using this api in the interim would be possible, we don't have much confidence in the stability of the API due to both the newness of it (only 3 months old) and the quick creation and deprecations of v1 and v2. Given that, at this time we don't plan to make this change, so I hope you don't mind that I close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/614739978","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55125#issuecomment-614739978","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55125","id":614739978,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDczOTk3OA==","user":{"login":"mark-vieira","id":4106672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4106672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-vieira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-16T15:56:41Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T15:56:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm reopening this as we've run into issues with folks on less stable internet connections downloading these JDKs from Artifactory.

Once I saw the issue, I reached out to the API team at AdoptOpenJDK to see if they would be willing to support a `HEAD` request as GitHub does not support it. That PR got merged into the API a last week, https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-api-v3/pull/168.\r\n\r\n@mark-vieira and @jasontedor if you take a look at that PR I linked, the Adopt API was modified to allow Gradle to do HEAD requests against the Adopt API.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/614755513","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55125#issuecomment-614755513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55125","id":614755513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDc1NTUxMw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-16T16:24:26Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T16:24:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think GitHub supports them directly now:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl -I https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk14-binaries/releases/download/jdk-14%2B36/OpenJDK14U-jdk_x64_mac_hotspot_14_36.tar.gz\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\nserver: GitHub.com\r\ndate: Thu, 16 Apr 2020 16:09:46 GMT\r\ncontent-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nstatus: 302 Found\r\nvary: X-PJAX, Accept-Encoding, Accept, X-Requested-With\r\nlocation: https://github-production-release-asset-2e65be.s3.amazonaws.com/233878254/ccd39400-6911-11ea-8e6b-4f0ba3a561d9?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWNJYAX4CSVEH53A%2F20200416%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200416T160946Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=17916229cfd5f76b4df044d75c7f0b97a0163a235dde0eca85913aef1f174b18&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&actor_id=0&repo_id=233878254&response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3DOpenJDK14U-jdk_x64_mac_hotspot_14_36.tar.gz&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream\r\n[...]\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/614759581","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55125#issuecomment-614759581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55125","id":614759581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDc1OTU4MQ==","user":{"login":"james-crowley","id":42618816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjE4ODE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/42618816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-crowley","html_url":"https://github.com/james-crowley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-crowley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-crowley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-crowley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-crowley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-crowley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-crowley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-crowley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-crowley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-crowley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-16T16:31:49Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T16:31:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"From my testing, it looks like Gradle follows that redirect to the aws s3 location, which does not allow for `HEAD` requests.
