Given a term `x` the script should calculate a similarity metric against the set of documents within an index. The search script should be compiled and executed using a `ScriptEngineService` instance. The problem is however that given a field that has been defined explicitly using the mapping endpoint, the field cannot be found within the segment. The source code part of this questions has been posted [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45599401/elasticsearch-5-5-searchscript).
