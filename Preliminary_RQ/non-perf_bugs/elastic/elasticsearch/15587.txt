The same steps work correctly in 2.0.2.\n\nThe steps I'm executing are:\n\n```\n# delete the index\ncurl -XDELETE localhost:9200/twitter\n\n# create the index\ncurl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/' -d '{\n    \"mappings\": {\n        \"tweet\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"message\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\", \n                    \"term_vector\": \"with_positions_offsets\", \n                    \"store\": true\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}'\n\n# insert a document\ncurl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1?refresh=true' -d '{\n    \"message\" : \"A new bonsai tree in the office. Bonsai!\"\n}'\n\n# search with highlighting\ncurl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_search?pretty' -d '{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"span_near\" : {\n            \"clauses\" : [\n                {\"span_term\": {\"message\": \"new\"}}, \n                {\"span_term\": {\"message\": \"bonsai\"}}\n            ], \n            \"slop\": 1, \n            \"in_order\": false\n        }\n    }, \n    \"highlight\": {\"fields\": {\"message\": {\"type\": \"plain\"}}}\n}'\n```\n\nThe search above is returning:\n\n```\n{\n  \"took\" : 7,\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\n  \"_shards\" : {\n    \"total\" : 5,\n    \"successful\" : 5,\n    \"failed\" : 0\n  },\n  \"hits\" : {\n    \"total\" : 1,\n    \"max_score\" : 0.13561106,\n    \"hits\" : [ {\n      \"_index\" : \"twitter\",\n      \"_type\" : \"tweet\",\n      \"_id\" : \"1\",\n      \"_score\" : 0.13561106,\n      \"_source\":{\"message\" : \"A new bonsai tree in the office. Bonsai!\"},\n      \"highlight\" : {\n        \"message\" : [ \"A <em>new</em> <em>bonsai</em> tree in the office. <em>Bonsai</em>!\" ]\n      }\n    } ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, it is incorrectly highlighting the occurrence of \"Bonsai\" at the end of the field that is not within 1 word of \"new\". A couple of things to note:\n1. This same exact set of steps produces correct highlighting results against Elasticsearch 2.0.2.\n2. There is an open bug for `span_near` queries not working using the Fast Vector Highlighter (FVH) -- https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5496 -- which is why I'm attempting to use the plain highlighter above\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
