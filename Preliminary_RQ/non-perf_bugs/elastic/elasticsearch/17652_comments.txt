We believe this to be a rare issue, based on the fact that it's been open for years and has no upvotes.  Also, a user has to go out of their way to hit this, and the resulting failure is relatively obvious.  On the other hand, fixing it either requires a huge breaking change to how aggregation results are formatted, or requires us to maintain a list of forbidden aggregation names, which would be a breaking change every time we added to it.  Neither option is appealing.  Based on this analysis, we feel making any change here would cause more harm than the bug is currently causing.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
