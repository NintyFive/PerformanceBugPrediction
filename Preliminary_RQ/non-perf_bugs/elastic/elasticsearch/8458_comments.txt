Really it depends on whether you need the new mappings applied to old documents or not.  If you do, then you have no option but to reindex.  If you don't then:\n- you can always add new fields to existing type mappings\n- you can add new \"sub-fields\" to existing field mappings eg to analyze existing fields in a different way (see http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-core-types.html#_multi_fields_3)\n- if your data is append-only, then you can create a new index for the new documents, and use an alias which points to the old and new index to search across both of them\n\nWith options 1 and 2, you can also reindex existing documents into the same index, which will fill in the newly added fields for you.\n\nWe are also planning to add a reindex API which will make the reindex process more reliable and less difficult.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
