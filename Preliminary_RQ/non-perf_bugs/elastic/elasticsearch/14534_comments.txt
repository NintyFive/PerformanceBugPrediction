That build timestamp is put into the jar manifest by a Gradle plugin. So to keep it simple, we just grab the timestamp directly out of the manifest (as a string). If you have a need for ISO 8601, we can certainly do that.\n\n> What was wrong with ISO 8601?\n\nNothing. Frankly, I was surprised that the Gradle plugin that we are using wasn't putting it into that format.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/156479828","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14534#issuecomment-156479828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14534","id":156479828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjQ3OTgyOA==","user":{"login":"spalger","id":1329312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjkzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1329312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spalger","html_url":"https://github.com/spalger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spalger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spalger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spalger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spalger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spalger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spalger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spalger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spalger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spalger/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-13T16:28:06Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T16:28:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Cool, it would be much appreciated :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/156561274","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14534#issuecomment-156561274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14534","id":156561274,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjU2MTI3NA==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-13T21:29:40Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T21:30:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Cool, it would be much appreciated :)\n\n@spalger I opened #14751 on our side to change the formatting. Note that the plugin we are using to get this information into the manifest in the first place does not include timezone information so without some extra complexity the best that we have right now is a local date time.
