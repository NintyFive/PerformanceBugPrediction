ES is then kept up to date by indexing all operations from the source, potentially concurrently. I this case the indexing API would be used and the version semantics are \"index this complete doc if the current doc version is older\". Notice how these semantics work nicely with concurrent indexing. It also means that the version given is the version of the complete document in the source.\r\n\r\nThe update API is syntactic sugar for \"get this doc and change it in this way if it has not changed\". This works nicely with interval version but it conflicts with the notion of an external source associating a version with a complete document.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this now. Please feel free to open a discussion on discuss.elastic.co to discuss things further. If it ends up we need to change/fix something we can open up a github issue.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/319591912","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25996#issuecomment-319591912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25996","id":319591912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTU5MTkxMg==","user":{"login":"maoxiajun","id":3657883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTc4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3657883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoxiajun","html_url":"https://github.com/maoxiajun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoxiajun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoxiajun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoxiajun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoxiajun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoxiajun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoxiajun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoxiajun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoxiajun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoxiajun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-02T07:30:31Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T07:30:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ok, I'm thinking about it, thx.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
