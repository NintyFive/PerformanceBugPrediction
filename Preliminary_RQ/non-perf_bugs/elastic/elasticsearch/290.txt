It assumes that the location object indexed includes a lat and lon numeric values. The `geo_point` type follows these rules and allows for more flexible indexing options / structure, but is not required.\n## Multi Location Per Document\n\nThe filter can work with multiple locations / points per document. Once a single location / point matches the filter, the document will be included in the filter.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
