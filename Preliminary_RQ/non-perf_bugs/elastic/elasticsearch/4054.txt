Default to return `all` by default, unless specific metrics specified.\n\nChange the path format to:\n\n```\n/{index}/_stats/{metric}\n```\n\nwhere:\n- `{index}`: comma-delimited list of indices, `_all`, or blank\n- `{metric}` is blank or comma-delimited list of metrics\n\nMetrics can be any of:\n- `completion`\n- `docs`\n- `fielddata`\n- `filter_cache`\n- `flush`\n- `get`\n- `id_cache`\n- `indexing`\n- `merge`\n- `refresh`\n- `search`\n- `store`\n- `warmer`\n\nFour metrics take optional parameters, which can be specified in the query string.  These are:\n- completion: `fields` or `completion_fields`\n- fielddata: `fields` or `fielddata_fields`\n- indexing: `types`\n- search: `groups`\n\nChange `level` to accept `cluster`, `indices` and `shards`, as per the cluster health API.  Default to `indices`.  If set to `cluster`, only return the `_all` stats.\n\nAdd the `translog` info from the index status API into the shard-level info of the indices stats API.\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
