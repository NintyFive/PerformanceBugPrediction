Implementing this feature is not easy, as it requires both changes to the way repository-level settings integrate with our settings infrastructure as well as the way that the rate limiter is hooked into the snapshotting / restore process. We are still interested in such a feature but we don't have immediate plan to work on it. As such, I'm going to close the issue. If anyone is interested in revived it please feel free to comment or +1.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
