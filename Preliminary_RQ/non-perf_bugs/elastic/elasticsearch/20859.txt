Yet, it became obvious to me that the semantics that are expected from the users perspective is somewhat a `last_modified` timestamp that is really updated every time the document is indexed on the primary shard. This implies, the value of this fields is updated:\n- when reindexed via `_reindex`\n- when updated (with script or not)\n- when indexed via the API\n\nthe field should be very clear in it's semantics such that it can NOT be provided or modified from the outside. Yet, what is still somewhat unclear to me is if it should be indexed, stored and / or have docvalues. I think when we add this we want the configuration options to be as small as possible maybe only `enabled: true|false`? For this to happen we need to know the usecases and I was hoping @niemyjski and @ejsmith could help with this to design this new field with clear semantics?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
