This aggregation is already selective in the sense that the number of buckets is manageable through the interval (whereas for terms you depend on the cardinality of your fields). Moreover, this would expose `histograms` to the same accuracy challenges as `terms`. I think such a feature would be better addressed by adding the ability to perform some post-processing on top of the reduced aggregation?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/59474366","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7103#issuecomment-59474366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7103","id":59474366,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDc0MzY2","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-17T07:10:15Z","updated_at":"2014-10-17T07:10:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed in favour of #8110 \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
