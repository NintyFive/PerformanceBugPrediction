From your logs:\n\n```\nCurrent thread (0x00007f8e6021f000):  JavaThread \"C2 CompilerThread5\" daemon [_thread_in_vm, id=21253, stack(0x00007f8da291e000,0x00007f8da2a1f000)]\n```\n\nIt's crashing in the server compiler. Maybe try upgrading your JVM to 8u77? If the issue persists, you'll have to open an OpenJDK issue. Sorry.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
