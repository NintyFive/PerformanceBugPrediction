This is admittedly a bit confusing since we are re-using server side objects in the client code and part of a much bigger discussion of de-coupling client and server code. (which is is on the roadmap).\r\n\r\nYour workaround, I would consider the correct way to do this if you are loading directly from disk, otherwise the expectation is to fully construct from code. \r\n\r\nClosing since we don't generally directly support loading resources from disk directly.
