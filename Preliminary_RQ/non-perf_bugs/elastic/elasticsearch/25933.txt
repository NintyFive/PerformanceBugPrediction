Have tried importing the shapefile, and geojson through ogr2ogr. also tried generating a json file to use with bulk update. The error I am getting is an ArrayOutofBoundsException. \r\n\r\nAlso to note, if I upload the JSON file without specifying a mapping i.e. a geo_shape, then the data gets sucked in, but I would expect it's then not indexed.\r\n\r\nAs I have consistently been able to reproduce this with different upload routes, I am assuming it has to be a bug - is there a way around it? \r\n\r\nError I am getting is below:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/aj7/12fa99044901d7db8b42a5d5d5753bf8\r\n\r\nI am happy to attach the json file if someone want's to try and see for themselves?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
