Indeed, it very likely happened because of zzz. Unfortunately this is a known issue on 1.x that all fields of the same index that have the same name need to have consistent mappings. In Elasticsearch 2.x this will be enforced and creating a type with different mappings will raise an error, which will be less trappy.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
