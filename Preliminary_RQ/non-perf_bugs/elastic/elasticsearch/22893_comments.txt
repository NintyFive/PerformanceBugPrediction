Though for cluster older than 2.0.0 we automatically add metadata stored fields (`ttl`, `parent`, ...) to retrieve. The combo makes a request that filters _source from the response.\r\nThe workaround is to add `\"_source\":true` in `source` ;) and it works fine but it should not be a requirement.  Although we'll have to document this behavior for the 5.2.0 timeframe.\r\n@nik9000 any thoughts ?\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/276488292","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22893#issuecomment-276488292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22893","id":276488292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjQ4ODI5Mg==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T20:52:24Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T20:52:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @nik9000 any thoughts ?\r\n\r\nI'm happy to put together a fix sometime in the next few days.
