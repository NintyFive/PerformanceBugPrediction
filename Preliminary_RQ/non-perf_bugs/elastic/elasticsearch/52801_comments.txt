So `D` is a bug, the default for `track_total_hits` when `rest_total_hits_as_int` is set should be to track the number of hits accurately. `E` and `F` is a correct workaround but it shouldn't be needed if we fix `D`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/593357369","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52801#issuecomment-593357369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52801","id":593357369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MzM1NzM2OQ==","user":{"login":"consulthys","id":1280019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODAwMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1280019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys","html_url":"https://github.com/consulthys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-02T11:28:38Z","updated_at":"2020-03-02T11:28:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank @jimczi so when specifying `rest_total_hits_as_int=true` one wouldn't have to also specify `track_total_hits: true`.
