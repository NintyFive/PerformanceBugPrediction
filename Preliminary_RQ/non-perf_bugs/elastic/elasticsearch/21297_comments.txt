Quickly answering your questions:\n\n> does the refresh op fsynced or still in memory?\n\nOperations are fsynced to the transaction log as soon as they are indexed. Refresh doesn't have to fsync them\n\n> when refresh, does it clear the related translog?\n\nNo it doesn't. Only flush clears the translog.\n\nIf you have any more questions about this please feel free to ask on discuss.elastic.co and we'll be happy to help.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/258107878","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21297#issuecomment-258107878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21297","id":258107878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODEwNzg3OA==","user":{"login":"kaybinwong","id":5570216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAyMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5570216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaybinwong","html_url":"https://github.com/kaybinwong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaybinwong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaybinwong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaybinwong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaybinwong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaybinwong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaybinwong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaybinwong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaybinwong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaybinwong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T10:29:49Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T10:29:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"got it, thx a lot\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
