If the user searches without any high ascii characters then I want to match against the folded tokens.  If the user searches with high ascii characters then I only want to match the unfolded tokens.\n\nI think the right way to implement this would be to get the `asciifolding` filter to spit out both the folded and unfolded tokens during indexing with 0 position increment between them and to not use it at all during searching.  Is that possible right now?  If not would Elasticsearch like me to make one?  If so, does it make sense to add a subclass of the `asciifoling` filter that supports the `keyword` parameter as though it were a stemmer?  \n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
