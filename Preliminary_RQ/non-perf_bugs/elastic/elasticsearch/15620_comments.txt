Let's say you have clusters based on a field (date, country or ....) and you have a tribe node in front of them. If you query with a date field, the tribe node should just route that query to the cluster that only has that date or country.\n\nWhat I'm really looking for is a sharding feature with the tribe node, is it already possible ? how could it be possible ?\n\nThanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/369002747","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15620#issuecomment-369002747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15620","id":369002747,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTAwMjc0Nw==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-27T19:46:29Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T19:46:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tribe node has been deprecated and removed, closing.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
