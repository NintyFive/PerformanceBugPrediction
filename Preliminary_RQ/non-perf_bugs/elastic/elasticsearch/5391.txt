It would be useful maybe to be able to disable writes globally to the tribes except for that particular tribe/index. At the moment I guess I have to run with writes enabled everywhere?\n\nAlthough I can't help thinking the write access should possibly be enforced by the remote clusters  rather than on each tribe node...\n","closed_by":{"login":"bodgit","id":559268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/559268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodgit","html_url":"https://github.com/bodgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bodgit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
