But if\n\"two words\"\nit returns the same 128 chars and all remainder of that field. Bit strange.\n\nES (v 0.16.0)\n\nPlease tell, can I do the trick with highlight fields like [\"item_.title\", \"item_.description\"]  in query fields?\n\nI understand, it looks bit strange. Iâ€™m try to explain:\nAll my docs contains 10 items with title and description (and so on, not important). I need to have 1 match per field, so my first version with just array of items wont work. If i setup number_of_fragments to 1 it returns _only_ 1 result for all 10 items. If i setup number_of_fragments to 0 it returns all description concatenated in 1 highlight. So solution is to make item1, item2 etc.\nIs it best solution?\n\nPS No any reaction on my 3 messages after first at mailing list. I believe this is a bug, so i created this issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
