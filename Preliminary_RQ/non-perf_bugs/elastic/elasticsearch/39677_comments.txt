Elasticsearch throws a request validation exception. \r\n\r\nI think it makes sense that from/size are disallowed when an id is specified, that is the behaviour in the other ml apis I looked at where object id and from/size parameters may be used:\r\n- GET Categories\r\n- GET Calendars\r\n- GET Filters \r\n- GET Buckets\r\n\r\nThe exception is GET Model Snapshots which silently ignores the page params if a snapshot ID is set.\r\n\r\n> This is unlike the behaviour of ml.getcategories which does allow this combination and returns an array with length 1.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code this isn't the case (on master at least). There is even a test to assert this combination of parameters is not allowed.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/x-pack/plugin/src/test/resources/rest-api-spec/test/ml/jobs_get_result_categories.yml#L121\r\n\r\n ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
