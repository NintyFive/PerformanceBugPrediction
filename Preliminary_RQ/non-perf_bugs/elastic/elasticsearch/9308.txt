We were unable to start two instances using the respective yaml configruations.\n\nInternalSettingsPreparer.java will search for a configuration file using `es.default.config`, `es.config` or `elasticsearch.config`. If it finds a setting using `es.default.config`, it will assume to load everything from the environment. Thus it will simply search for a `elasticsearch.yml`, `elasticsearch.json` or `elasticsearch.properties` in the root configuration file, even though it has already loaded the configuration from the `es.default.config` setting. \n\nBasically it is ignoring the stated specific configuration file and reloads the configuration from the default file in the specified directory.\n\nThe provided init.d script passes a combination of `es.default.config` and `es.default.path.conf` which can lead to the conflict. \n\nI know we have an edge case, but it cost us lots of coffee and headaches nonetheless.\n\nIn my opinion one should either:\n- refactor InternalSettingsPreparer to be more intuitive,\n- log the potential conflict from the java console,\n- rewrite the provided init.d script to pass a different parameter configuration, or\n- at least comment the init.d script to point to the potential conflict.\n\nI would be happy to assist and write a pach, but I would need an expert to point me into the right direction. Also I have no idea how backwards compatible one should be.\n\nRegards\n\nStefan from codecentric\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
