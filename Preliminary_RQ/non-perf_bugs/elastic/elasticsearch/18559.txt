However, whenever I restore an index from a snapshot it clobbers my new index template and replaces it with what seems to be the template of the index that was restored. I would expect that the template that I set up would be maintained instead of being overwritten. When I re-update the template it works fine (until I restore another index).\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Back up an index on a 1.7 cluster\n2. Add an index template with some modification of that index's template to a 2.3 cluster (change shard count, set doc_values on a field, etc.)\n3. Restore 1.7 index onto 2.3 cluster\n4. Check index template on 2.3 cluster\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\nThis was in the logs at about the same time that the index finished restoring:\n[_node-id_] [_index-name_] re-syncing mappings with cluster state because of types [[_type_]]\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
