the management thread pool (used by stats and cats) is bounded to 5, but it still accepts further requests, and then waits indefinitely for a thread to free up.\n\nThis is dangerous because node stats can be a somewhat costly operation (in proportion to number of shards on the node)....\n\nAnd it confounds debugging, because it can cause loooong hangs in e.g. node stats requests via browser/curl, and it also is not graceful for recovering from \"too many management requests\" overload.\n\nIf we instead rejected the request it would make it clearer which clients are causing too much load.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
