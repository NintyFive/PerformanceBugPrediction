At the moment you can create an alias using aliases by doing the following:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_aliases' -d '{\n    \"actions\" : [\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"2015-01-07\", \"alias\" : \"today\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"2015-01-06\", \"alias\" : \"yesterday\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"2015-01-05\", \"alias\" : \"3DaysAgo\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"2015-01-04\", \"alias\" : \"4DaysAgo\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"2015-01-03\", \"alias\" : \"5DaysAgo\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"2015-01-02\", \"alias\" : \"6DaysAgo\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"2015-01-01\", \"alias\" : \"7DaysAgo\" } }\n    ]\n}'\n\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_aliases' -d '{\n    \"actions\" : [\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"today\", \"alias\" : \"thisWeek\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"yesterday\", \"alias\" : \"thisWeek\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"3DaysAgo\", \"alias\" : \"thisWeek\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"4DaysAgo\", \"alias\" : \"thisWeek\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"5DaysAgo\", \"alias\" : \"thisWeek\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"6DaysAgo\", \"alias\" : \"thisWeek\" } }\n        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"7DaysAgo\", \"alias\" : \"thisWeek\" } }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nThis makes it look like `thisWeek` points to `today` which points to `2015-01-07`. What actually happens is that `2015-01-07` gets two aliases: `today` and `thisWeek`. This works absolutely fine but anyone using this method needs to be aware that if they update the `today` alias to point to `08-01-2015` it will not update the `thisWeek` alias and they will need to update that alias as well.\n\nIs this something we should add to the documentation?\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
