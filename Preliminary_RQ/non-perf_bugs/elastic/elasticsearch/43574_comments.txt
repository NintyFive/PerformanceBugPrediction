However the example in the description is not correct, when set to false this option will remove the position increment that filtered terms introduce. So the query `\"tom the king\"` with `enable_position_increments` set to `false` will rewrite the query as if the term `the` was never present. This means that document that contain `tom king` will match while `tom the king` will not.\r\nThe option has no effect on queries that don't contain a filtered term (`the` in your example).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/505431945","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43574#issuecomment-505431945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43574","id":505431945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTQzMTk0NQ==","user":{"login":"bdecarne","id":1277131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzcxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1277131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdecarne","html_url":"https://github.com/bdecarne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdecarne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdecarne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdecarne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdecarne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdecarne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdecarne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdecarne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdecarne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdecarne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T12:55:49Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T12:55:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for this explanation, although it is disappointing for my case.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to reach my goal without using slop ?\r\n\r\nThank you","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/505434093","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43574#issuecomment-505434093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43574","id":505434093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTQzNDA5Mw==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T13:01:34Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T13:01:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Is there a way to reach my goal without using slop ?\r\n\r\nYou could write a custom stop filter that would not increment the position when removing a term, otherwise you'll need to use a `slop`.
