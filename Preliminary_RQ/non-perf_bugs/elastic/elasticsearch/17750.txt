much discussion in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15728 we have agreed to make the following changes to the field stats API:\n- `?fields` will accept wildcards, so that it can match all fields\n- field stats will return the field `type`, and whether it is searchable (`index ==true`) and aggregatable (`doc_values==true || (index==true && fielddata==true))`\n\nWhen `?level=cluster` (the default), fields with the same name are collapsed into a single entry unless the fields have a different `type`, in which case the whole request returns an exception. This collapsing process should change as follows:\n- An entry should be returned for fields with conflicting `type`, but with an `error` key which describes the error.\n- `searchable` and `aggregatable` are collapsed to `true` if any of the instances of that field are searchable or aggregatable.\n\n/cc @rashidkpc @spalger @jpountz @martijnvg \n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
