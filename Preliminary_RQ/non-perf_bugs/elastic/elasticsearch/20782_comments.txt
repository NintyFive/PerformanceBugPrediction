You could potentially set up a new index with different types and then run a [reindex](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/docs-reindex.html) on the existing documents/index.\n\nI'm going to close this out because it sounds like everything is fine in the elasticsearch here.  If there's something couchbase is doing wrong when pushing data into elasticsearch, you may want to file an issue with them.  For general purpose questions and troubleshooting, you can use [our discuss forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
