The downside is that if we do that, we should really add e.g. a qa scenario that tests it, since its more involved. \n\nI'm also hesitant to overhaul native script support, since scripting engine support is currently also undergoing refactoring in master, and we might want to do things completely differently there (e.g. perhaps native scripting is a plugin or something, i dont know, have not even looked at it).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/143394902","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13811#issuecomment-143394902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13811","id":143394902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzM5NDkwMg==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-26T03:42:48Z","updated_at":"2015-09-26T03:42:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we should just stick to a doc fix for now.
