Default is `10`.\n- `index.merge.policy.floor_segment`: Segments smaller than this are \"rounded up\" to this size, ie treated as equal (floor) size for merge selection.  This is to prevent frequent flushing of tiny segments from allowing a long tail in the index. Default is `2mb`.\n- `index.merge.policy.max_merge_at_once`: Maximum number of segments to be merged at a time during \"normal\" merging. Default is `10`.\n- `index.merge.policy.max_merge_at_once_explicit`: Maximum number of segments to be merged at a time, during optimize or expungeDeletes. Default is `30`.\n- `index.merge.policy.max_merged_segment`: Maximum sized segment to produce during normal merging.  This setting is approximate: the estimate of the merged segment size is made by summing sizes of to-be-merged segments (compensating for percent deleted docs).  Default is `5gb`.\n- `index.merge.policy.segments_per_tier`:  Sets the allowed number of segments per tier.  Smaller values mean more merging but fewer segments. Default is 10.\n- `index.reclaim_deletes_weight`: Controls how aggressively merges that reclaim more deletions are favored.  Higher values favor selecting merges that reclaim deletions.  A value of 0.0 means deletions don't impact merge selection. Defaults to `2.0`.\n- `index.compound_format`: Should the index be stored in compound format or not. Defaults to `false`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
