We don't know at this point how people use it and more importantly how people upgrade their scripts. I'd much prefer that folk can go to a version X that has both by default. My suggested plan is:\n- deprecate groovy in 5.0 but ship as a module for easy upgrade\n- announce on a blog with the deprecation notice (maybe we can even think of doing the move to a plugin in a minor?)\n- remove it in 6.0 unless shit hits the fan\n\nit will prevent the angry user that did all the work to upgrade and then realized that they where missing a plugin? I feel folks should be happily surprised that painless is there instead of having pain due to too fast moving. It really costs us nothing but a couple of bytes in the zip file. If I'd upgrade with scripts in an index or a file. I'd first get the upgrade done then work on my scripts to cut over to painless. Painless is such a beautiful addition I really don't want to move to fast to hide the joy it should bring to the user by angry issues from users that required the BWC.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/241850067","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20129#issuecomment-241850067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20129","id":241850067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTg1MDA2Nw==","user":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T19:33:06Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T19:33:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm happy with @s1monw proposal here to deprecate Groovy first as long as we stick to the plan to ultimately remove it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/241850434","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20129#issuecomment-241850434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20129","id":241850434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTg1MDQzNA==","user":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T19:34:30Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T19:34:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> It really costs us nothing but a couple of bytes in the zip file.
