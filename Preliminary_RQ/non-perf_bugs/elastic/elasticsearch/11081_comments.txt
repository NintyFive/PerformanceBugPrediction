But this is a bigger problem than just deleting settings. We also need to check for any references to the setting (eg deleting an analyzer that is in use by a field) and be able to reset the default value (eg when deleting `refresh_interval`).\n\nThis requires a much bigger settings rewrite, which we plan to do at some stage.  I'm going to close this ticket in favour of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6732\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/102511169","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11081#issuecomment-102511169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11081","id":102511169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjUxMTE2OQ==","user":{"login":"comdiv","id":2387862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODc4NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2387862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comdiv","html_url":"https://github.com/comdiv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comdiv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comdiv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comdiv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comdiv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comdiv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comdiv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comdiv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comdiv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comdiv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-15T20:05:35Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T20:05:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hm. Much wrong is how it is now in main trunk.\nFor example:\n_settings \n{\n   \"x\" : {\n          \"a\" : \"b\"\n    }\n}\n\nand then \n\n_settings\n{\n      \"x\" : null\n}\n\nwhat doest cause?\n\n{\n    \"x\": null,\n   \"x.a\" : \"b\"\n}\n\nIt's invalid config i think.
