at: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/combine-elasticsearch-5-1-1-and-repository-hdfs/69659\r\n\r\nIf you define as described [in our docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/repository-hdfs-config.html) the following `elasticsearch.yml` settings:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nrepositories:\r\n  hdfs:\r\n    uri: \"hdfs://es-master:9000/\" # optional - Hadoop file-system URI\r\n    path: \"some/path\" # required - path with the file-system where data is stored/loaded\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt fails at startup because we don't register the global setting `repositories.hdfs.path` in `HdfsPlugin`.\r\n\r\nWe should either support all global `repositories.hdfs` settings we documented or remove that from our docs so people must provide those settings only when registering the repository with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT _snapshot/my_hdfs_repository\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"hdfs\",\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"uri\":
