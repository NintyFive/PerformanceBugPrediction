However, today the context suggester uses `OR` logic when specifying multiple contexts. For example, a search for:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET myindex/mytype/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"suggest\": {\r\n    \"my_suggestion\": {\r\n      \"prefix\": \"sta\",\r\n      \"completion\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"suggest\",\r\n        \"contexts\": {\r\n          \"context1\": [\r\n            \"A\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"context2\": [\r\n            \"11\"\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill return suggestions that have a context of `\"context1\" : \"A\"` OR `\"context2\" : \"11\"`. This poses a problem if you'd like to return suggestions to the user for a specific combination of contexts.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround today, you can concatenate the contexts to simulate the logic:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"contexts\": {\r\n      \"context1_and_2\": [\r\n        \"A:11\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
