It extends from `NumericMetricsAggregator.MultiValue` class. Its code structure closely resembles that of the `Stats` aggregator. For my requirements, I need the doc Ids to be received in ascending order in the overridden `collect()` method. For most queries, I do get the doc Ids in ascending order. Interestingly for `bool` `should` queries with multiple clauses, I get doc Ids in descending order. How can I fix this?
