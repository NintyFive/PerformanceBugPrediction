I'm wondering if this really is an issue with the plugin and not a result of some orchestration removing the key again behind the scenes (thus causing the plugin to fall back to some metadata auth path). I could not reproduce this so far and I have not seen this happen in the logs for our own default repo+credentials. I'll bring it up during todays snapshot resiliency sync so we can track down the root cause of this.\r\nRegardless, maybe it's fine to allow the `resolve` permission for the plugin so we can at least get an easier to interpret error message in this case. I'll look into that and will open a PR once the deeper issue has been identified.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/648890458","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58409#issuecomment-648890458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58409","id":648890458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0ODg5MDQ1OA==","user":{"login":"paulcoghlan","id":805060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTA2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/805060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcoghlan","html_url":"https://github.com/paulcoghlan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcoghlan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcoghlan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcoghlan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcoghlan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcoghlan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcoghlan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcoghlan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcoghlan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulcoghlan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-24T15:25:53Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T15:25:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@original-brownbear - as discussed, you can look for `manage-keystore.sh` (wrapper around keystore binary) in the allocator service logs:  https://aws-eu-central-1-logging-staging-cloud.elastic.co/goto/e9fde89186ead7b0266ec5e628cae095\r\n\r\nThis will tell you if/when the keystore got updated.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/662910777","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58409#issuecomment-662910777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58409","id":662910777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjkxMDc3Nw==","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-23T09:33:51Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T09:33:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can we close this?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/662912112","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58409#issuecomment-662912112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58409","id":662912112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MjkxMjExMg==","user":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-23T09:37:10Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T09:37:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yea let's close it this was fixed in Cloud.
