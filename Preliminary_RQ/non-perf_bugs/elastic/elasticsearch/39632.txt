But the instance just keeps going down after 5-15 minutes of normal usage. Spitting out logs containing `SIGSEGV` errors. Attempting to fix the issue, I did a rolling upgrade from 6.3.0 to 6.6.1 since I've got no clue might as well try to let it fix itself, but it did not. The problem persists. Then I also tried to start Elasticsearch with several different version of JDKs, namely `8u131`, `8u201`, `8u202`. But they didn't help address the situation. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1. `sudo systemctl start elasticsearch`\r\n 2. wait 5-15 minutes\r\n 3. WHACK ! There's your `SIGSEGV` log and Elasticsearch was shut down.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n[hs_err_pid4401.log](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/2925009/hs_err_pid4401.log)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
