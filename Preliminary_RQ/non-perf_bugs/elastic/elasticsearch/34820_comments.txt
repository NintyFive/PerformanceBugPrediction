If we do that, I don't think there's still a valid reason to disable the testing task, other than disabling the `test` task added by Gradle.

So if we disable a testing task this will no longer hold true and we will detect it, but this leaves us without a way to mute all tests for a task. \r\nTo solve this I will change randomized testing task not to fail on empty, and add a check to forbid testing task without classes.
