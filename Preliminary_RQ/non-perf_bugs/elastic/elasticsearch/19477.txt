Data is being pushed to node 1 in the cluster in bulk => total count 1 million .\nAfter bulk operation complete shutting down node 1 .\nRunning query to count docs the number is the same as before node 1 shutdown 1 million.\ndeleting the index .\nCounting the number of docs once again => no data\nstarting node 1 => there are docs but less then 1 million (~800k) .\n\nThe expected results is to have none .
