A big advantage would be to just specify the index, type and id of a document (which is returned with each index response) that has just been indexed, internally a get request can then fetch the content of the recently indexed document and then the percolate api will execute on that. \n\nPercolate an existing document with id 1 and type tweet from index twitter:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XGET 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1/_percolate'\n```\n\nPercolate an existing document with id 2 and type tweet from index twitter-2013: (percolating 2013 tweet against 2012 queries)\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XGET 'localhost:9200/twitter-2013/tweet/2/_percolate?percolate_index=twitter-2012'\n```\n\nAdditional options for percolating an existing document on top of existing percolator options:\n- `id` - The id of the document to retrieve the source for.\n- `percolate_index` - The index containing the percolate queries. Defaults to the `index` defined in the url.\n- `percolate_type` - The percolate type (used for parsing the document). Default to `type` defined in the url.\n- `routing` - The routing value to use when retrieving the document to percolate.\n- `preference` - Which shard to prefer when retrieving the existing document. \n- `percolate_routing` - The routing value to use when percolating the existing document.\n- `percolate_preference` - Which shard to prefer when executing the percolate request.\n- `version` - Enables a version check. If the fetched document's version isn't equal to the specified version then the request fails with a version conflict and the percolation request is aborted.\n- `version_type` - Whether internal or external versioning is used. Defaults to internal versioning.\n\nInternally the percolate api will issue a get request for fetching the`_source` of the document to percolate.\nFor this feature to work the `_source` for documents to be percolated need to be stored.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
