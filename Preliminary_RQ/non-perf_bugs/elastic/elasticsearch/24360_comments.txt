Thank you for the feature request. Elasticsearch already has a couple of mechanisms to apply back-pressure. For example, we limit the [amount bytes in-flight](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/circuit-breaker.html#in-flight-circuit-breaker), we have multiple other limits (maximum request size, maximum number of script compilations / minute, etc). We also apply backpressure by rejecting new tasks if the respective task queues are full. You can also configure queue lengths so I am not sure what the benefit of this ticket would be. Hence I am closing but feel free to reopen with further explanation if I misunderstood.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
