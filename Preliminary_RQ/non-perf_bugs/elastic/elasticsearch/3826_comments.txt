to report a small typo, in the docs it says the keyword to use to list all repositories is \"_all\", but the example curl line:\n\n```\ncurl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/all'\n```\n\nuses \"all\", which fails with:\n{\"error\":\"RepositoryMissingException[[all] missing]\",\"status\":404}\n\nThis works fine:\n\n```\ncurl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/_all'\n```\n\nCheers,\nSebastian.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/31653051","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3826#issuecomment-31653051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3826","id":31653051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjUzMDUx","user":{"login":"sebaes","id":463474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzQ3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/463474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebaes","html_url":"https://github.com/sebaes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebaes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebaes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebaes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebaes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebaes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebaes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebaes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebaes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebaes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-06T14:46:03Z","updated_at":"2014-01-06T14:46:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Another
