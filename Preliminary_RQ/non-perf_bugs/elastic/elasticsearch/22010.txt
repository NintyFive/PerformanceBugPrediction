Create a mapping with 'dynamic: false' object and some child field\r\n```\r\nPUT http://localhost:9200/testindex/_mapping/sometype\r\n{\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"data\": {\r\n      \"dynamic\": false,\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"child\": {\r\n          \"properties\": { \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 2. Add a document with some non-mapped field under the 'child' field\r\n```\r\nPOST http://localhost:9200/testindex/sometype/1\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": { \r\n    \"child\": { \r\n      \"newField\": \"I shouldn't be here\" \r\n    } \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 3. Check the index mapping and see that 'newField' was added dynamically\r\n```\r\nGET http://localhost:9200/testindex/_mapping\r\n```\r\nResult:\r\n```\r\n\"sometype\" : {\r\n  \"properties\" : {\r\n    \"data\" : {\r\n      \"dynamic\" : \"false\",\r\n      \"properties\" : {\r\n        \"child\" : {\r\n          \"properties\" : {\r\n            \"name\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" },\r\n            \"newField\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
