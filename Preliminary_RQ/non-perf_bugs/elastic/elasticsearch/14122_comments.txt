The `values` always have to be explicitly listed.  If values are missing then we assume there are nodes missing and take the appropriate action, so there is no auto-adjustment if nodes come and go.  \n\nSo then it comes down to having an alternate syntax for a short list of values that happen to be numeric.  This is so easy to handle client side, i don't understand why we would possibly add more complex settings in Elasticsearch to handle this one particular use case that doesn't apply to most users, who will use descriptive values instead (`zone_1`, `region_x`).\n\nClosing as won't fix.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
