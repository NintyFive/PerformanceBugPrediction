Nice and simple!\n\nThe rolling index concept is good. I would separate the mechanism for index creation from the mechanism for index deletion.   Then, one could separate different policies for each.\n\nIn thinking about this, I guess I'd like to see a policy agent within elasticsearch that listens to/intercepts requests directed at a given alias. Indexing requests (writes) to the alias would be intercepted and could result in new index creation, if the index creation policy says that a new index is needed.\n\nSimilarly, an index request of a query could trigger an index deletion or index migration to backing store.\n\nIs it possible to install a plugin that listens to requests on a particular index?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/9751927","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1500#issuecomment-9751927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1500","id":9751927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3NTE5Mjc=","user":{"login":"karussell","id":129644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/129644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell","html_url":"https://github.com/karussell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-10-24T19:00:55Z","updated_at":"2013-01-06T17:26:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The code is wrapped in a plugin https://github.com/karussell/elasticsearch-rollindex\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/44200046","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1500#issuecomment-44200046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1500","id":44200046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjAwMDQ2","user":{"login":"karussell","id":129644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/129644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell","html_url":"https://github.com/karussell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-26T15:51:28Z","updated_at":"2014-05-26T15:51:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks like curator is doing this now: https://github.com/elasticsearch/curator\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
