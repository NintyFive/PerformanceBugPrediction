This would be similar to the `bucket_selector` aggregation (which removes buckets based on a script).\n\n**Example**: Given a filters aggregation that's provided with 300 filters, we have a sub-aggregation that calculates a metric.  We only want the results of buckets having the 5 largest values of the aggregated metric.  Today, without a \"Top N bucket selector\" aggregation, the client has to retrieve all 300 and sort/filter on client side.\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
