This might be a useful option but given all the options that we already have and which work only for some of the highlighters (this one would work only for the plain one), I would not expose it for now. We will also start some more general discussion around highlighting and how we want to improve things there post 2.0. Closing.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
