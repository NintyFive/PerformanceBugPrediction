This collection, as well as the get/put methods in `NodeService` were removed in the following commit: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/dbbfadeefaffa71c46a7640437524779be611bcb#diff-58b020797e31e6c490011454f2fa6106\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, it wasn't a very good way to implement that functionality to begin with. Is there an alternative way for a plugin to share custom metadata that's specific to each running plugin instance? \r\nNodeInfo has a list of plugins and modules, but I can't find a way to set and retrieve custom data/attributes on a per-node basis. It can't be in some configuration/global store because at runtime the plugin needs responses only from the nodes that are actually part of the cluster at that time. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
