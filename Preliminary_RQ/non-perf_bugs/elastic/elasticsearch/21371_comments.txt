initial view, I think it is because `trace_match` is set to `true` while there only being one pattern. `trace_match` is used to keep track of which of the multiple patterns matched the field, if there is only one, the behavior around this is different since there is nothing really to trace. This was meant to be as an optimization, but is probably the cause of this behavior.\n\nI'll open a PR shortly to fix this. I suppose trace match should still work even though there is one pattern.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/258910132","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21371#issuecomment-258910132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21371","id":258910132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODkxMDEzMg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-07T17:55:52Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T17:55:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@talevy could you also look at improving the docs for `trace_match` - it's not obvious from the wording what this feature should be used for.  thanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
