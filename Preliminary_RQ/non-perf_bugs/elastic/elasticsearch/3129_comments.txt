But on the other hand, if I set a timeout of 3000ms for example, it just means I'm not willing to wait for more than that, and will timeout to the end client anyway. \nEven though I can see all the benefits of timing out and still retrieving maybe a \"partial result set\", I think its even more useful to know that I wont have long queries running using resources when I don't care about their result anymore. \nMaybe an \"abort_on_timeout\" option could do the trick and still maintaing the partial result timeout? \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/49419893","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3129#issuecomment-49419893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3129","id":49419893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDE5ODkz","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-18T11:12:24Z","updated_at":"2014-07-18T11:12:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed in favour of #4586 \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
