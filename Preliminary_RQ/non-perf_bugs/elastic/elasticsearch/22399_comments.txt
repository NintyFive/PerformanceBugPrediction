Community sourced translations of ever-changing documentation is tricky because it requires an enormous amount of work (so unpaid community contributors are likely to get burnt out) and we have no way of checking whether the translation is correct or not.\r\n\r\nAt some stage, we are likely to provide translations, but we would have to do it via a paid agency to ensure the standards are maintained long term.\r\n\r\nThank you for the offer.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
