If you are in fact posting a bug report or\na feature request, please include one and only one of the below blocks\nin your new issue.\n-->\n\n**Elasticsearch version**: 2.1.1\n\n**JVM version**: \njava version \"1.8.0_20\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_20-b26)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.20-b23, mixed mode)\n\n**OS version**:\nCentOS release 6.7 (Final)\n\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\nTop hits subaggregation setSize(1) not returning one top hit/per bucket instead it is returning more than one document even though the size is set to one. Below is the query i am trying to execute.\n\n```\nSearchResponse sr=client.prepareSearch(versionIndexName).setTypes(versionIndexType).setQuery(Quer \nyBuilders.boolQuery().must(QueryBuilders.rangeQuery(\"indexDate\").lte(givenTime))) \n.addAggregation(AggregationBuilders.terms(\"form.id\").field(\"form.id\").size(0) \n.subAggregation(AggregationBuilders.topHits(\"top\").setExplain(true).setSize(1) \n.setFrom((size*index)).addSort(SortBuilders.fieldSort(\"indexDate\") \n.order(SortOrder.DESC)).setFetchSource(true))).execute().actionGet();\n```\n\nSTEPS in the query:\nFilter by indexDate less than or equal to a given date.\naggregate based on formId. Forming buckets per formId.\nSort in descending order on versionDate filed and return top hit result per bucket.\n\nI have two versions (v1 and v2) for form.id=1 with indexDate field set to  2016-04-22T16:02:32.738-07:00 for v1 and 2016-04-22T16:02:33-07:00 for v2. If i search by date 2016-04-22T16:02:33-07:00 i expect to see a bucket with only v2 returned in it because that is the closest to the searched date. But the bucket has both the versions.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Index two documents with version field as v1 and v2, indexDate filed set to 2016-04-22T16:02:32.738-07:00 for v1 and 2016-04-22T16:02:33-07:00 for v2, id field is set to 1 and 2.\n2. Run the above query with givenTime= 2016-04-22T16:02:33-07:00.\n3. Retrieve the buckets and values.\n\nExpected result: 1 bucket with one version(v2) in it. Because that is the top hit for that bucket after sorting.\nActual result: 1 bucket with both the version(v1 and v2).\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
