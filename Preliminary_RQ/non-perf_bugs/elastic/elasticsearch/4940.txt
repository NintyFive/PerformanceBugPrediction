(priority queue is used to collect the competitive hits that match with a query)\n\nCurrently the priority queue size grows with each subsequent scroll request with what has been specified in `from` of the first search request.\n\nNote: scan scroll is unaffected by this issue, which already is a highly optimized search to fetch a large part or all docs from a cluster. Scan scroll forcefully sort the hits always by the Lucene docids, while with the regular scroll can now support any sort efficiently.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
