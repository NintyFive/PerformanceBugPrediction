When I ran the service without the \"x-pack.security.enabled:true\", it worked. Then, I added the x-pack line and I have restarted the service and it hasn't worked. The reason that I have put it on Github is, it's a fresh Elasticsearch installation in a vanilla server where JDK 12 is running. There's no way that another external force to stop it. Let me know your thoughts.
