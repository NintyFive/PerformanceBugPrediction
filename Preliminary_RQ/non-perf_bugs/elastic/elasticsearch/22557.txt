version**:  `5.1`\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: none\r\n\r\n**JVM version**: \r\n```\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-b14)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n**OS version**: `Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS`\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is a bug or a feature, but in my opinion it shouldn't work like that.\r\n\r\nWhen filtering source (`_source`), there are returned fields that contain only part of the string.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have source object looking like this: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"photos\": [\"a.jpg\", \"b.jpg\"],\r\n    \"photosCount\": 2\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen filtering like this: `\"_source\": [\"photosCount\"]`, `photos` field is also returned.\r\n(same for `\"_source\": \"photosCount\"` and `\"_source\": {\"include\": [\"photosCount\"]}`)\r\nNow I have to explicitly exclude `photos`, for not having it in response.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1.\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/some_thing/some_type' -d '\r\n{\r\n    \"photos\": [\"a.jpg\", \"b.jpg\"],\r\n    \"photosCount\": 2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 2.\r\n```\r\ncurl
