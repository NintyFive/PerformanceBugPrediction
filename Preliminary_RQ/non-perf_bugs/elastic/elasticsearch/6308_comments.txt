But when I added a template for my mapping in my config directory I got no matching again. But i may have found where the mistake comes from : I have several types with a geo_point field. Probably the error comes from it. \n\nHere is my template:\n\n``` sh\n{\n    \"template\": \"*\",\n    \"mappings\": {\n        \"test\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"location\": {\n                    \"type\": \"nested\",\n                    \"properties\":{\n                        \"point\":{\"type\":\"geo_point\"}\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        },\n\n        \"test2\":{\n            \"_parent\":{\"type\":\"test\"},\n            \"properties\":{\n                \"point\":{\"type\":\"geo_point\"}\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI tried to remove the \"test2\" type from my template and I got the matching again. When I was in elasticsearch 1.1.0 before, I got this template already so the error should be from there also. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/44183760","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6308#issuecomment-44183760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6308","id":44183760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTgzNzYw","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-26T12:16:09Z","updated_at":"2014-05-26T12:16:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hey,\n\ncan you recreate a complete example with curl, that is not working on 1.2.0 or 1.1.2, so it can be fixed (I just want to make sure I am not missing anything, that's why I ask you to do it)?
