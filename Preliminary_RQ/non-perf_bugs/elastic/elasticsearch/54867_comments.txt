If a cert file gets updated before the 1st poll, it won't be picked up. This could be the main contributor to the failure.\r\n\r\n* A minor possibility: Both `SSLService` and `SSLConfigurationReloader` are created in [`XPackPlugin`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/core/XPackPlugin.java#L236-L239) as part of the bootstrap [setup](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.6/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/bootstrap/Bootstrap.java#L349) process. But `ResourceWatcherService` (used by `SSLConfigurationReloader`) does **not** start and queue its 1st poll until the [start](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.6/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/bootstrap/Bootstrap.java#L358) process is invoked. This is a much shorter gap.
