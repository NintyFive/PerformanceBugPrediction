Unfortunately the json parser is forward only and there is no way to rewind it. This is a clear blocker which makes the low hanging fruit higher ;). We could add the object to the context and check in all the field mappers that accept multi fields (or copy_to) if the value is populated or not but this would complicate the mapping even more. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/164737096","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4320#issuecomment-164737096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4320","id":164737096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDczNzA5Ng==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-15T11:36:01Z","updated_at":"2015-12-15T11:36:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks for looking at this @jimferenczi. i think we should close in favour of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15388\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
