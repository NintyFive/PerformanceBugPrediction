The other one is the massive amount of Bucket objects created (maxOrd).\n\nWe should do this more like a lucene collector: use the PQ more efficiently so we only create queue_size Bucket objects. With high cardinality fields, this method is just as much of a hotspot as collecting ordinals so we should optimize it as such: at least as a step avoid creating Bucket objects if it can't compete with the PQ, but maybe later try to optimize the loop with sentinels and stuff.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
