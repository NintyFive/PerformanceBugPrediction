One index has `notes` that I need to show, while the other index has `notes` that need to filter, but the exact contents should not be exposed.  The `notes` field of the `notes_are_private` index mark the record as confirmed and contain an audit log of who confirmed the record.  Certainly the same thing could be accomplished by changing the name of the `notes` field in `notes_are_private` to another name and excluding that field from the entire query.  However, the intent is to complete the unique \"view\" of the same index that the filter is designed to provide.\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"actions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"add\": {\r\n        \"index\": \"notes_are_public\",\r\n        \"alias\": \"notes_search\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"add\": {\r\n        \"index\": \"notes_are_private\",\r\n        \"alias\": \"notes_search\",\r\n        \"filter\": {\r\n          \"term\": {\r\n            \"notes\": \"confirmed\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"_source\": {\r\n          \"excludes\": [ \"notes\" ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
