Or maybe I am misunderstanding query syntax.  Consider this test case (v1.1.1, clean install, no modifications):\n\nFirst, let's create an empty index as usual:\n\n```\ncurl -XDELETE localhost:9200/test\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test\n```\n\nIn my case, I am interesting in searching sequences of arbitrary text characters by using trailing wildcards.  I don't want any analysis, I just want to be able to query for an arbitrary sequence of characters and have the engine return docs that start with that sequence.  So I am using a \"not_analyzed\" field, and I want to disable all tokenization at search time by using \"keyword analyzer\":\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/doc/_mapping -d '{\n  \"doc\" : {\n    \"properties\" : {\n      \"token\" : {\n        \"type\" : \"string\",\n        \"index\" : \"not_analyzed\",\n        \"search_analyzer\" : \"keyword\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nLet's now insert a test doc:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9200/test/doc -d '{\n  \"token\": \"/abc.123.SomeMoreText\"\n}'\n```\n\nTrying a query string with a trailing wildcard, everything seems to be working as expected:\n\n```\ncurl -XGET localhost:9200/test/_search -d '{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n      \"default_field\": \"doc.token\",\n      \"query\": \"token:\\\\/abc.123.*\"\n    }\n  }\n}'\n\n{\"took\":4,\"timed_out\":false,\"_shards\":{\"total\":5,\"successful\":5,\"failed\":0},\"hits\":{\"total\":1,\"max_score\":1.0,\"hits\":[{\"_index\":\"test\",\"_type\":\"doc\",\"_id\":\"onIsyEjiTRWkudeCMHgC0w\",\"_score\":1.0, \"_source\" : {\n  \"token\": \"/abc.123.SomeMoreText\"\n}}]}}\n```\n\nBut if I add even one extra character, the query will not return anything (POSSIBLE BUG):\n\n```\ncurl -XGET localhost:9200/test/_search -d '{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n      \"default_field\": \"doc.token\",\n      \"query\": \"token:\\\\/abc.123.S*\"\n    }\n  }\n}'\n\n{\"took\":3,\"timed_out\":false,\"_shards\":{\"total\":5,\"successful\":5,\"failed\":0},\"hits\":{\"total\":0,\"max_score\":null,\"hits\":[]}}\n```\n\nI cannot explain this behavior.  I was supposed to escape any \"regex\" mode by putting backslashes in front of /; there are no exceptions thrown either, just no results returned.  There are no other special characters in play, according to the list from http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html .  So this looks like a bug.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
