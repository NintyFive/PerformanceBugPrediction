We are rather working on having the Java client go through REST like all of the other language clients, so that ideally the client shares a minimal part of the server code only, and doesn't use any internal mechanism that ended up being exposed to client users with the Java API. \r\n\r\nA smarter REST client could be implemented provided that the needed info is exposed via some API, but we don't plan on implementing anything like this for the time being.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/296585750","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24277#issuecomment-296585750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24277","id":296585750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjU4NTc1MA==","user":{"login":"makeyang","id":13898618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODk4NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13898618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang","html_url":"https://github.com/makeyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makeyang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-24T09:01:09Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T09:01:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"if it's for time being, why close it rather than put it high-hang fruit and at least open it for community to discuss and implemet it?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/296586263","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24277#issuecomment-296586263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24277","id":296586263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjU4NjI2Mw==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-24T09:02:54Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T09:02:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Because we are not interested in having such a client in our repo for the reasons mentioned above.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
