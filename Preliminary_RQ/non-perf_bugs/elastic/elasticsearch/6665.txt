I'm not sure, but it can be related to the thread #6441  \n\nPreconditions:\n1. Elasticsearch 1.2.1 is newly installed. All settings have default values.\n2. Index is newly created.\n3. Index mapping created via API:\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"elasticbug\": {\n      \"mappings\": {\n         \"filesetdata\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n               \"fileContent\": {\n                  \"type\": \"string\",\n                  \"include_in_all\": false\n               },\n               \"format\": {\n                  \"type\": \"integer\",\n                  \"include_in_all\": false\n               },\n               \"metadata\": {\n                  \"properties\": {\n                     \"Fil_1\": {\n                        \"properties\": {\n                           \"OriginalFileID_2\": {\n                              \"type\": \"string\",\n                              \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"\n                           },\n                           \"OriginalFileName_3\": {\n                              \"type\": \"string\",\n                              \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"\n                           }\n                        }\n                     }\n                  }\n               },\n               \"state\": {\n                  \"type\": \"byte\",\n                  \"include_in_all\": false\n               }\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n'fileContent' field is used for storing text extracted from .pdf files via Apache Tika.\n4. All other index settings have default values.\n\nSteps:\nIndex this huge document:\n_PUT elasticbug/filesetdata/54c87535-1baf-46d7-a6f9-2b0c914c7479 [huge doc](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=50939A116F9A78E1!126&authkey=!AJA5NQ6t__mQZqw&ithint=file%2c)_\n**Right after that** try to GET this document:\n_GET elasticbug/filesetdata/54c87535-1baf-46d7-a6f9-2b0c914c7479_\n\n[Expected]\n\n```\nDocument was successfully obtained\n```\n\n[Actual]\n\n```\n[2014-07-01 16:01:45,009][DEBUG][action.get] [Shard] [elasticbug][3]: failed to execute [[elasticbug][filesetdata][54c87535-1baf-46d7-a6f9-2b0c914c7479]: routing [null]]\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No type mapped for [105]\n    at org.elasticsearch.index.translog.Translog$Operation$Type.fromId(Translog.java:223)\n    at org.elasticsearch.index.translog.TranslogStreams.readSource(TranslogStreams.java:59)\n    at org.elasticsearch.index.engine.internal.InternalEngine.get(InternalEngine.java:340)\n    at org.elasticsearch.index.shard.service.InternalIndexShard.get(InternalIndexShard.java:469)\n    at org.elasticsearch.index.get.ShardGetService.innerGet(ShardGetService.java:195)\n    at org.elasticsearch.index.get.ShardGetService.get(ShardGetService.java:106)\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.get.TransportGetAction.shardOperation(TransportGetAction.java:109)\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.get.TransportGetAction.shardOperation(TransportGetAction.java:43)\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.support.single.shard.TransportShardSingleOperationAction$AsyncSingleAction$1.run(TransportShardSingleOperationAction.java:163)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(Unknown Source)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\n```\n\n**NOTE:** \n1. After a while (about 30m) GET works fine and obtains document without any problems. As far as i understand it depends on _index.translog.flush_threshold_period_ setting.\n2. I also noticed that _refresh_ parameter set to true in index command (_?refesh=true_) fixes this issue. Interesting that force __refresh_ via api DOES NOT help.\n3. As was mentioned in #6441, to work around the problem you can trigger a __flush_\nbefore the get.\n4. This issue was not reproduced in 1.1.0.\n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
