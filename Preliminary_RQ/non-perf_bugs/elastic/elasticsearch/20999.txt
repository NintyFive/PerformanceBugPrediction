It also added support for creating `WITHIN`, `CONTAINS`, and `INTERSECTS` relational range queries. The use case is for indexing a continuous range of values (e.g., calendar entries as single dimension long ranges) and finding all indexed ranges that fall within, contain, or intersect either a discrete target value, or range of values.\n\nThis feature will add index and query support to Elasticsearch for numeric and date range field types. Since numeric values do not yet provide multi-dimension support the initial feature implementation shall be single dimension only. Aggregations will also not yet be supported by the initial implementation and will be added in a follow on issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
