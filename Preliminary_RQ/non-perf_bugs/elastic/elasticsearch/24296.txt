In order to make things work you have to download the Geotrust Cert (which is the root CA for slack's cert) and add that to xpack config:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.geotrust.com/resources/root_certificates/certificates/GeoTrust_Global_CA.pem\r\n\r\nAnd adding that to the list of ca certificates:\r\n\r\nxpack.ssl.certificate_authorities = [\"/path/to/GeoTrust_Global_CA.pem\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Install X-Pack With Elasticsearch\r\n 2. Enable SSL\r\n 3.
