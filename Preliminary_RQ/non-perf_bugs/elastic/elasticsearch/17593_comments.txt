headers are printed out as part of the response body already, I don't think there's any need to send them back as response headers too. They were introduced to prevent having to add custom exceptions to our codebase whenever we need to throw an exception that has to hold some additional metadata that ElasticsearchException doesn't support. Maybe the headers naming should be changed as well to something like metadata? @s1monw @tlrx  what do you think?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
