This means that the plugin tool does not understand how to read a meta-plugin packaged for 6.2.0, an oversight. We are not going to add the meta-plugin infrastructure back solely so that the plugin tool can understand how to remove such a plugin.\r\n\r\nInstead, I think that we should indeed document this as a known issue and advise removing the plugin before performing the upgrade. Since Elasticsearch will refuse to start here (because the on-disk `x-pack` plugin will be in a format that Elasticsearch does not understand) there is no risk of performing a downgrade to use the 6.2.4 plugin tool to remove `x-pack`, and then proceeding with the upgrade again.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/427187623","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34307#issuecomment-427187623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34307","id":427187623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzE4NzYyMw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-04T22:17:26Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T22:17:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nik9000 Would you address this as a documentation issue, adding this as a known issue to the 6.4.x breaking changes and release notes?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/430623041","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34307#issuecomment-430623041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34307","id":430623041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDYyMzA0MQ==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-17T13:14:14Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T13:14:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I backported #32016 to 6.x and 6.4.
