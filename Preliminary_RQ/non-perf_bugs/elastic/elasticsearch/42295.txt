But since it's an optional update I guess that's not true.  For those users who don't have it, it can be obtained from https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows (Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 are not mentioned because they ship with the UCRT built in).\r\n\r\nAnother thing that some users have found the hard way is that we build on the assumption that SSE4.2 instructions will be available.  These have been in Intel processors for over 10 years and AMD processors for over 5 years, but again, it seems that there are some users trying to run ML on older hardware.  So the requirement for a processor that supports SSE4.2 instructions could be added to the same ML pre-requisite page in the docs.","closed_by":{"login":"lcawl","id":26471269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDcxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26471269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl","html_url":"https://github.com/lcawl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
