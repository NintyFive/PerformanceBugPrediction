When ES tries to compile parent template, following error occurs\n\n```\nfailed to load/compile script [parent]\norg.elasticsearch.common.mustache.MustacheException: Template 'child' not found\n```\n\nIt looks like ES understands partial syntax but is unable to find existing template.\n\nI'm facing this problem in ES 1.4.4 but [the same problem was in 1.2.2](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/elasticsearch/mustache/elasticsearch/ihTskQ2RheA/vxTNlOC_Z5wJ) too\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
