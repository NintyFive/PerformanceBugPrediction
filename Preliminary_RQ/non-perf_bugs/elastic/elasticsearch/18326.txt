I don't quite get why time is converted from UTC to local time, and then back to UTC. I would expect a certain point of time to be constant, regardless of timezone. Formatting of time, however, I can understand would require time zone specific behaviour.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
