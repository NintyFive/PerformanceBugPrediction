Somehow that causes two versions of guava to be on the classpath. Could we flip the testing dependency so this depends on hlrc instead of hlrc depending on it? That way testing the Elastic licensed bits depends on the Apache licensed bits. And it makes Eclipse happy.\r\n\r\nIndeed HLRC pulls dependencies from other projects but itself, is used by the testing of others.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/700169606","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52895#issuecomment-700169606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/52895","id":700169606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDE2OTYwNg==","user":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-28T17:17:11Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T17:17:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nik9000 I believe your commit from last week fixed this problem.
