Imagine if these were collected at the cluster level, but a node restarts. This means that the cluster-wide collection count and collection time would decrease and as such I don't see these metrics being useful at the cluster level.\n\nAlso, if you were to use these for some monitoring, what is the use of knowing that the collection count or collection time sharply increased over some time interval without knowing which node or nodes caused that to happen?\n\nI think these metrics make sense and are useful at the node level, but not at the cluster level.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/215880620","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17224#issuecomment-215880620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17224","id":215880620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTg4MDYyMA==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-29T21:00:49Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T21:00:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No feedback, closing.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
