We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. \r\n\r\n- Moreover, your question currently is lacking context. Please include information regarding your cluster setup and configuration, along with your network layout and configuration. \r\n\r\n- It would be also helpful to provide some information regarding the workload against your cluster: are you doing indexing/updates/queries and how many concurrent clients are doing each?\r\n\r\n- Are you using any specific app (e.g.: some other product from the elastic stack) for the data ingestion?\r\n\r\nThank you!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
