When bulk-indexing, the problematic document is logged by elasticsearch , but only if the elasticsearch log level is set to `debug`. This produces a lot of \"query\"-debug log messages (for us 0.5GB daily) coming from problematic queries. While these are deliberately ignored by us, the important `MPE` occurs very rarely (and then it produces little log messages, maybe 0.5KB).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo possibilities come into mind:\r\n1. increase log level to at least `info` when an `MPE` occurs\r\n2. as 1. could vice versa be annoying for people who don't care so much of dropped information when indexing it would be very smart to be able to configure separately a log level for a) query and b) indexing.\r\n\r\nThe first option(increasing log level) would be easy to implement.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dr0i","id":944023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NDAyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/944023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i","html_url":"https://github.com/dr0i","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
