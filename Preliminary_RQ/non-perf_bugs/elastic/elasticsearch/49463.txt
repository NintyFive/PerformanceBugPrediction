That used to be available by calling: http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings?include_defaults=true&filter_path=**.script.engine.*.inline\r\n\r\nA couple of wrinkles:\r\n1) Determining whether scripts are available as stored and/or inline is a per-node setting, so hitting different nodes may return different results.\r\n2) The script contexts supported per `ScriptEngine` is not defined in a current API.  For this we may add a method to `ScriptEngine` which returns supported contexts.  If we add a method to the `ScriptEngine` interface, it's a **breaking change**.\r\n3) Different contexts maybe be available for OSS and Basic licenses.\r\n\r\ncc: @rjernst @jdconrad ","closed_by":{"login":"stu-elastic","id":24232742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjMyNzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24232742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic","html_url":"https://github.com/stu-elastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
