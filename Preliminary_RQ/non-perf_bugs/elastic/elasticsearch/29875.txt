comment by @nik9000:*\n\nWhen I run the `sql-cli` script as a \"normal\" user I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/x-pack/sql-cli\r\n/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/x-pack/../elasticsearch-env: line 70: /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch: Permission denied\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe sql-cli script doesn't actually need anything from `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch`. It really only needs `elasticsearch-env` to get `$ES_HOME`.\r\n\r\nYou can work around this by running the sql-cli jar directly `java -jar sql-cli-*.jar` or with `sudo -u elasticsearch sql-cli`, presuming you can `sudo` to `elasticsearch`.","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
