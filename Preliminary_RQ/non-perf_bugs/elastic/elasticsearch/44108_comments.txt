To support this we must use an alphanumeric sort order.\r\nA classic problem with sorting pure number strings alphanumerically is that 10 will come before 2.\r\nIf you need \"correct\" ordering on strings like this you can zero-prefix these strings e.g. 002 and 010.\r\n\r\nClosing as \"not a bug\"\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
