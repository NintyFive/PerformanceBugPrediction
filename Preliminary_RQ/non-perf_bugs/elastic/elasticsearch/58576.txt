Create a simple index : \r\n```\r\nPUT /intervals_test\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"dynamic\": \"strict\",\r\n    \"properties\": {\r\n      \"object\": { \"type\": \"text\" }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 2.  Index that simple document : \r\n```\r\nPUT /intervals_test/_doc/1\r\n{\r\n    \"object\": \"issue with intervals queries from search engine. So it's a big issue for us as we need to do ordered searches. Thank you to help us concerning that issue\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n 3. Execute that unordered intervals query\r\n```\r\nPOST /intervals_test/_search\r\n{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"intervals\": {\r\n            \"object\": {\r\n                \"match\": {\r\n                    \"query\": \"issue search ordered\",\r\n                    \"max_gaps\": 1,\r\n                    \"ordered\": false\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe document will not match. The answer is correct.\r\n\r\n 4. Execute the same query but with `\"ordered\": true` option : \r\n```\r\nPOST /intervals_test/_search\r\n{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"intervals\": {\r\n            \"object\": {\r\n                \"match\": {\r\n                    \"query\": \"issue search ordered\",\r\n                    \"max_gaps\": 1,\r\n                    \"ordered\": true\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe document will match, but it would not\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
