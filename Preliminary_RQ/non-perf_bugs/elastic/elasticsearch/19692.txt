Here is the response body\n\n```\n{\n  \"took\": 1001,\n  \"timed_out\": false,\n  \"_indices\": {\n    \"_all\": {\n      \"found\": 57,\n      \"deleted\": 0,\n      \"missing\": 0,\n      \"failed\": 57\n    },\n    \"index-name\": {\n      \"found\": 57,\n      \"deleted\": 0,\n      \"missing\": 0,\n      \"failed\": 57\n    }\n  },\n  \"failures\": []\n}\n```\n\nNothing in the logs indicate a failure. Issuing a _search with the same query yields those 57 document _sometimes_. Ie, the documents are only found on the replica and never the primary. Checking the document delete count on the _cat endpoints yields a 57 document discrepancy too. \n\nSo far, the only solution has been to cancel the allocation of the replicated shared via the _reroute API and let ES rebuild the replica. \n\nThere is a possibility that this is unrelated to delete-by-query directly and it is only surfacing another issue. The general step we take before we realize there a problem is...\n1. Switch an alias from pointing to index A to index B\n2. Use the reindex API to move documents from A to B\n3. Use delete-by-query to purge all moved documents from A\n\nIf (1) or (2) have an issue then maybe (3) just surfaces it. \n\nSome observations: \n- This has happened several times and it's pretty consistent. Probably about 25% of all big move operations\n- It's always the replicas that have the extra documents\n- We tag the index times on the documents and I never saw clustering on the left-behind documents\n- Rebuilding the replica has always worked as a workaround\n- When we delete in batch, we have tried both small and large sizes with the same results\n- The number of out-of-sync documents is always small (<100)\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
