However I wonder if we should not throw an explicit error instead. The fix in master is to ignore the preceding synonym filters when we build the synonyms so this works in some cases (single term synonyms) but could lead to strange behavior in others (multi term synonyms, double expansion, ...). It should not be difficult to merge two synonym files together (we accept duplicates in the input) so it would be more consistent to rely on a single synonym filter per analyzer. \r\n@romseygeek WDYT ?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/445888619","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36433#issuecomment-445888619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36433","id":445888619,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTg4ODYxOQ==","user":{"login":"romseygeek","id":1347065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDcwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1347065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek","html_url":"https://github.com/romseygeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T16:55:46Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T16:55:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I allowed this specifically in #34331 following some discussion on the mailing list about synonyms.  One of future paths I'd like to take is to allow the synonym filter to apply a type name other than `SYNONYM` to its emitted tokens.  You could have one synonym filter that applies 'exact' synonyms, and then one that applies hypo- or hypernyms instead, and you can then boost the resulting terms differently in the query builder.  This requires that we allow multiple synonym filters to be chained, and that they are independent.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/445945445","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36433#issuecomment-445945445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36433","id":445945445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTk0NTQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T19:40:22Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T19:40:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok this makes sense, thanks for explaining @romseygeek .
