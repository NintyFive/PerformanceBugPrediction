On this field i have own similarity provider (plugin). \n\nSo when I query specific value let say 2, scoring doesnt use PerFieldSimilarity, it use ConstantScore.\n\n{\n  \"from\": 0,\n  \"size\": 13,\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"must\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": {\n            \"someId\": {\n              \"value\": 2,\n              \"boost\": 0.3\n            }\n          }\n        }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOn score explanation i saw that this query is rewrite to Range Query. Is any positility to set rewrite option like in multi term query (prefix).
