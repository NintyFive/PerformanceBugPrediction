Queries always return 0 hits. It works fine for same query and documents, if I index them without child-parent relationship.\r\n\r\nAdding `_routing` does not change anything. I tried (as an experiment) providing the reference with `_parent` parameter, as documentation tells that like parameter _\"is similar to the one used by the Multi GET API\"_, but it leads to \"failed to parse More Like This item. unknown field [_parent]\".\r\n\r\nWorks when providing text in like parameter directly.\r\nIt worked fine with same query in version 2.x.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Create mappings A and B, where B has A as a parent\r\n 2. Index some documents\r\n 3. Query B with `more_like_this`\r\n\r\nA query for reproduction can be basic:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"query\":{\r\n    \"more_like_this\":{\r\n      \"fields\":[\r\n        \"text\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"like\":[\r\n        {\r\n          \"_index\":\"index_name\",\r\n          \"_type\":\"B\",\r\n          \"_id\":\"child_id\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"min_term_freq\":1,\r\n      \"min_doc_freq\":1\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
