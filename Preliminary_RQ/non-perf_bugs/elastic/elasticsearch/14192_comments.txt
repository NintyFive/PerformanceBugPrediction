Also current names being close to the original Lucene names means that knowing Lucene already helps when adopting Elasticsearch (not sure though whether those knowing Lucene already is still the majority of newcomers to Elasticsearch). Only downside: You have to look closer which class you open in your IDE from a search to not open the wrong one (For me personally that isn't much of a problem, might be different for others). \n\nSwitching to different names looses the link to the original Lucene query - this can be both good and bad: Might make things clearer (after tons of arguments on which name to select), it potentially gives us an option to switch the underlying implementation without confusing users, might make things more complicated for those trying to apply their Lucene knowledge to Elasticsearch.\n\nIMHO: I'd stick with the current names w/o the builder suffix.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/216514963","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14192#issuecomment-216514963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14192","id":216514963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjUxNDk2Mw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T12:39:46Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T12:39:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is this issue now resolved?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/216523954","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14192#issuecomment-216523954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14192","id":216523954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjUyMzk1NA==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T13:17:11Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T13:17:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"not resolved, needs to be done.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/245560036","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14192#issuecomment-245560036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14192","id":245560036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTU2MDAzNg==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-08T10:41:45Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T10:42:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I wonder if this should be done for 6.0 rather than 5.0.
