(I tested this out locally). With one node you will have unassigned replicas anyway, but the primaries won't be moved.  \n\n> 37.5gb free is enough for me (I dont know if is right to taking percentajes)\n\nYou can change these settings to whatever works for you, including absolute values instead of percentages.  We just use 10% as the default.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
