We should allow users to specify the ID, type and index where the Shape they wish to use can be retrieved from.   This allows Shapes to be pre-loaded into an index from other sources.\n\nThis change will involve adding a simple ShapeFetchingService which will be responsible for retrieving  and parsing the Shapes.\n\nAdditionally, the GeoShapeQueryParser and GeoShapeFilterParser will support a \"named_shape\" JSON object with four fields:\n- \"id\": ID of the Shape\n- \"type\": Index type where the Shape is indexed\n- \"index\": Name of the index where the Shape is\n- \"shape_field\": Name of the field that the Shape itself is indexed in\n\nFuture issues will cover providing ways to pre-load the Shapes from common sources.\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
