We never lookup the hostname from the IP. for the transport client you should be all fine here but nodes in the cluster might be different. the node will likely drop out of the cluster and then rejoin with the new IP? to enable that host name resolution you had to enable an undocumented setting so I don't think it's really changing anything for you?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
