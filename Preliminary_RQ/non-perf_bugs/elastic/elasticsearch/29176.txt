This change was motivated by both buggy setting of the classpath env var by our start scripts, as well as misconfiguration by users. The assumption was users should not muck with the classpath; instead they they should write plugins which are given the property SecurityManager permissions.\r\n\r\nSince that time, it has become apparent there are some valid use cases for *adding* to the classpath. Specifically, using additional log4j functionality, which must be present when log4j is initialized, as well as customizing the java FileSystemProvider (eg to use a quota monitoring FS).\r\n\r\nThis issue is to discuss adding the ability, through an environment variable, which would be added to the classpath. While we will need to add read/readlink permissions to security manager to read the given jar files, no concrete policy changes should be necessary.
