I discovered when trying to write a test case using this class which calls the method: `waitForDocs(final long numDocs)` which propagates down a null value to this portion of the code.\n\nProblem seems to surface on this line:\nhttps://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/test/ElasticsearchIntegrationTest.java#L999\n\nAs noted in the documentation indexer is Nullable, but if null here, we see a null pointer. I think in the null case we could default to 0 and the code would work as documented, but wanted to get some feedback before making the change.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
