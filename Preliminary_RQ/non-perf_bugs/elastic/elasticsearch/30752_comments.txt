Elasticsearch uses the official AWS SDK Java client to access to S3 repositories. The SDK decides if it should use path style access or not when accessing a bucket and the documentation can be [found in the SDK source code](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/1.11.235/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/S3ClientOptions.java#L78):\r\n\r\n> The default behaviour is to detect which access style to use based on the configured endpoint (an IP will result in path-style access) and the bucket being accessed (some buckets are not valid DNS names).\r\n\r\nSo in your case I guess you can try to use an IP address as the endpoint.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
