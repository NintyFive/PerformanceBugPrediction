This will require the following:\r\n\r\n* A new `timeout_type:hard` query parameter as part of search requests, as opposed to the default `timeout_type:partial`(these names are up for debate).\r\n* The `default_timeout_type` setting would be a new cluster-wide setting allowing admins to define a default policy when clients don't provide any choice on search requests.\r\n* A suitable HTTP response code will be needed for errors - 503 overloaded looks like it may be most appropriate?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
