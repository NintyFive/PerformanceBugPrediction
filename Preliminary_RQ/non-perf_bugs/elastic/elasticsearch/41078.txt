It would be nice to have a less aggressive feature similar to this which only logs when the `max_result_window` is larger than a threshold. \r\n\r\nFor example, setting `index.max_result_window` to 10,000 and `index.log_result_window_threshold` to 5,000 will log at the `WARN` level all queries with more than 5,000 results while still returning a http 200 code and the search results. \r\n\r\nA potential use-case for this is where elasticsearch cluster admins are working to move usage to search after/scroll API and pinpointing existing queries which aren't using the scroll API. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"clandry94","id":5351125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTExMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5351125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clandry94","html_url":"https://github.com/clandry94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clandry94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clandry94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clandry94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clandry94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clandry94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clandry94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clandry94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clandry94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clandry94/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
