As you already noted, your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. I'm sorry your question didn't get any response there so far but we try to keep Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. Furthermore please note that this is the Elasticsearch repository. Maybe you could get additional information over at [the Beats repo](https://github.com/elastic/beats), although I think trying the forum again would be prefered.\r\n I'm closing this as an issue here for above reasons.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/560363445","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49754#issuecomment-560363445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49754","id":560363445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDM2MzQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"danil-lavrentyev","id":36068271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDY4Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/36068271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danil-lavrentyev","html_url":"https://github.com/danil-lavrentyev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danil-lavrentyev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danil-lavrentyev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danil-lavrentyev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danil-lavrentyev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danil-lavrentyev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danil-lavrentyev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danil-lavrentyev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danil-lavrentyev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danil-lavrentyev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T11:51:16Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T11:51:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cbuescher, thanks for quick response and proper pointing.\r\nHope guys from beats repo will take a look! :)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
