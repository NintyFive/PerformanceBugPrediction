Recovery in most cases has higher priority than cluster rebalancing. When the cluster has problems or node is restarted one may want the node to be quickly recovered even paying the price of slower indexing for short period of time. This is not always true for rebalancing.\n\nI also have an impression that `recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` is used not only for network traffic but also disk reads. Why I think so? I had setting `recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` 60mb and decided to do rolling restart. Before each node restart I triggered flush synced (BTW most of shards  are immutable). It was taking very long until node was recovered even thought there was very little network traffic (most of data was just read from disk). When I changed `recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` to 600mb recovery was much much faster. Look at the chart below. Is this true that `recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` applies also for disk reads? Or maybe there is another reasons that changing `recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` to 600mb helped so much.\nThis is observation is the most important reason why I asked whether recover and rebalance should share the same setting for `max_bytes_per_sec`.\n\nThe chart below is from ES 2.3 cluster. \n\n![selection_657](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6692291/18992371/33ea0018-871e-11e6-8889-75a3c7e569fc.png)\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
