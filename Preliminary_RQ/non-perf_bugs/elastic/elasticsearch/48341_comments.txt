This is the END_BYTE character that is used by the in-memory datastructure for the completion suggester. The other two are control characters \\u001e  and \\u001f which serve as internal separation characters in the suggester automaton. \r\n\r\nI assume this case came up during testing? I suggest we document this somewhere with the field type, would that be sufficient?
