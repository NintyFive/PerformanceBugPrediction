seems to be caused by the change to made security disabled by default on trial licenses.\r\n\r\nIf a node does not set `xpack.security.enabled` in the config, and tries to join a cluster, it doesn't know what type of license its supposed to be using, and seems to be acting as if its on a trial license with security disabled.\r\n\r\nThis means that `SecurityServerTransportInterceptor.interceptSender().AsyncSender.sendRequest()`  does not intercept the request, and does not set the system-user context for outgoing requests.\r\n\r\nSince the requests do not have an authentication header attached to their context, the remote node rejects the initial handshake, and the new node cannot join.","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
