For that reason I'm not sure whether this would be a bug report or a feature request.\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version**: 2.4, 5.x, master\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: []\r\n\r\n**JVM version**: 8.0\r\n\r\n**OS version**: MacOS Sierra\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\nThere is an index with a parent type and two child types.\r\nThe use-case requires to reassign child types to other parents.\r\nThe `conflicts` query parameter is to be set to `proceed` in this use-case as the application guarantees no changes to the documents during reindexing.\r\nAs the number of child documents to reassign may be quite large `_reindex` API looks like a perfect tool for the job to offload that to and to avoid transferring large amounts of data back and forth.\r\nThe idea was to update `_routing` and `_parent` to do that.\r\nThe same use-case also requires to update one field in child documents to match a field in the new parent as data denormalization technique to enable certain queries. An example of such a query would be \"get all child documents with trigger date 6 months after trigger date in parent document\", thus child documents have both dates, one of which must always match parent's trigger date.\r\nHowever, there is a check in `org.elasticsearch.index.reindex.TransportReindexAction.validateAgainstAliases()` that prevents reindexing into the same index. I can't find a good reason why.\r\nPlease let me know if more information is required.\r\nPlease also let me know if that is a reasonable and actionable request so I can create a PR to change/fix this.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Create an index with one type\r\n 2. Create a document in that type\r\n 3. Reindex that document using `_reindex` API supplying the same index in both `source` and `dest` fields in the reindex query\r\n\r\n**Expected**:\r\nThe document is reindexed without an error.\r\n\r\n**Observed**:\r\nException is thrown stating: `reindex cannot write into an index its reading from [some_index]`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
