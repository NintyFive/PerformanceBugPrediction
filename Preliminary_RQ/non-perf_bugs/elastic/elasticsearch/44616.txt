As anomaly detection jobs and datafeeds have become more closely coupled this is undesirable and adds complexity.\r\n\r\nThe update datafeed REST endpoint should be changed to report an error if it receives a request containing `job_id`.  If an 8.x node receives a request over wire transport that contains `job_id` then it should refuse to process the request and return an error response.\r\n\r\nRemoval of the ability to move a datafeed to a different job should then open up the possibility to simplify other code.  For example there will be no need for 8.x to consider deleting datafeed timing stats when moving a datafeed to a different job.  There may be other places where the code can be simplified too.","closed_by":{"login":"przemekwitek","id":19312454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzEyNDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19312454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek","html_url":"https://github.com/przemekwitek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
