I think it'd be useful to make that more explicit since seeing a number like `000001` also makes me think that the limit is `999999`.\r\n\r\nThis also leaves the question of \"is there a max suffix for the rollover API?\" The answer to that question appears to be `Integer.MAX_VALUE`: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/e4391afd98c99e05ce1ca2163d1a096a0405d72b/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/admin/indices/rollover/TransportRolloverAction.java#L230-L233\r\n\r\nI believe the rollover will blow up at that point since currently it looks for the last `-`. E.g. when rolling an index of `foobar-2147483647` you will end up with `foobar--2147483648` which the parser will pull `2147483648` off of and try to parse as an `int` causing a `java.lang.NumberFormatException`.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly an extreme edge case, but I'm wondering if ES should handle that behavior explicitly. Or at the least use a `long` which makes it an even more extreme edge case.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
