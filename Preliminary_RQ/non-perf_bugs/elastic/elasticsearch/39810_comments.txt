I don't think it's too unreasonable to expect someone consuming a low-level geospatial API to understand how to convert the hashes into geometry (e.g. they are already building a mapping or geospatial application if they are using the API...).  \r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/36901 we added documentation showing how to do a simple conversion in JS, we could do similar for popular languages/libraries if needed.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, we can chat about this again and see what the full team thinks now that there are more tiles.
