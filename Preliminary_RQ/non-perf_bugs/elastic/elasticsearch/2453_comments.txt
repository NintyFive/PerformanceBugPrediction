You're already inside a script, which allows you to make whatever decision you want in order to handle the missing-value case.  Just adding (the now deprecated) `ignore_unmapped` parameter (see #7039) to this seems like a blunt instrument.\n\nClosing this ticket.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
