This is incorrect and misleading since that's the package of the server. It should be changed to something more appropriate like `sql.proto` or (to avoid a cycle with 2 below) `sql.proto.action.\r\n\r\n2. the package name of the shared-proto project is `sql.proto`. Due to 1 above, it should be `sql.proto.shared` or (since that creates a cycle between `proto.shared` and `proto`) to `sql.shared.proto` or `sql.proto.common` .\r\n\r\nThat is, the package name should properly convey the project name and the hierarchy (`sql-proto` depends on `shared-proto` not vice versa) without splitting an existing package name.","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
