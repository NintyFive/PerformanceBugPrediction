From our perspective not much has changed from the issues #21377 as well as the decision we made back then. The main aspect why we don't consider this a feature that we want to support is the single node nature of the feature. Elasticsearch is a distributed system and single node use cases can be an invariant but shouldn't be special-cased, we never added anything that only works only for the 1 node case.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/436717065","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/35283#issuecomment-436717065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/35283","id":436717065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjcxNzA2NQ==","user":{"login":"dominic-p","id":1195080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1195080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominic-p","html_url":"https://github.com/dominic-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominic-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominic-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominic-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominic-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominic-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominic-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominic-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominic-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominic-p/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-07T17:55:48Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T17:55:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for taking the time to explain your reasoning.
