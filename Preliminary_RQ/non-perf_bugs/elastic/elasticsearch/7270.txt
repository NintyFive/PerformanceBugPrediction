For the previous test case, the line `while (key != nextBucket.key) {` loops endlessly because the zone adjustments seem not to be taken into account.\n\nWe have seen similar things with post_zone (unfortunately, I could not reproduce it with a test case).\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch-t","id":8446609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDY2MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8446609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch-t","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
