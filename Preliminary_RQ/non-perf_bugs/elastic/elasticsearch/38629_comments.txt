It is indeed a valid issue, but this proposal doesn't solve it and may make things worse in some setups.\r\n\r\nAdding randomness to the allocator is undesirable because there is significant value in the allocator's behaviour being predictable and reproducible. Also, echoing https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37638#issuecomment-455991399:\r\n\r\n> I do not think that treating new shards differently from existing ones is a good idea. Elasticsearch's behaviour today is desirable in some cases, and the proposed change could cause many unnecessary and expensive relocations. Additionally, rebalancing the already-assigned shards may simply immediately undo the effects of the change proposed here.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
