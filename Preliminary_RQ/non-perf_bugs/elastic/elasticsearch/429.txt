Scripts end with the common lang extension (`mvel`, `js`, `py`, `groovy`).\n\nThe name of  a script is the name of the file, prefixed by internal directories. For example, if the script exists in `config/scripts/group1/group2/test.py`, the script name will be `group1_group2_test`.\n\nThe script name can then be used in any element that accepts a script, replacing the actual script content.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
