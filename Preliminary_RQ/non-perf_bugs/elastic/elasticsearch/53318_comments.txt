Or are you missing the context in which this error is returned? If you manually send a rest request you (or your application) should still know which Url was hit, wouldn't it? And if you do this programmatically, the error should also be sent as a response to a particular request, so you should be able to map them, unless I'm missing something here.

It would really ease our workflow if the name of the template trying to be created or updated was included in error response as well. All of our template updates are performed programmaticly so it would be difficult to pinpoint a given response.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, all of our requests to elasticsearch are made using the bulk api which once again adds to the complexity of matching a request to a response. Let me know if that helps out.\r\n\r\ncc: @cbuescher ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/598088830","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53318#issuecomment-598088830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53318","id":598088830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODA4ODgzMA==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T09:27:49Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T09:27:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks, just two follow up questions:\r\n\r\n> All of our template updates are performed programmaticly\r\n\r\nWhere are these updates triggered?
