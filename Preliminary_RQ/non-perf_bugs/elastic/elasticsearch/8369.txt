The work load should be the same for all shards in a group, meaning that it shouldn't matter how many primary shards there are on any one node. \n\nThe only API which doesn't follow this principle is the `update` API, which can run a potentially heavy script on the primary shard.  This can result in hotspots in the cluster, where one node happens to host many primary shards (see #8149).\n\n@bleskes suggested a way to fix this: by changing the `update` API to perform the `GET` and `script` phases on any primary or replica in a shard group.  This would change the characteristics of `update` to be more like a normal distributed get-and-reindex.\n\nThis increases the window for conflicting changes, so it is probably worth changing `retry_on_conflict` to default to `1`, instead of `0`.\n\nIf the user is sure that their updates are light and won't cause hotspots on the primary, then they can opt in to primary-only updates with `?preference=_primary`\n\n/cc @s1monw \n","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
