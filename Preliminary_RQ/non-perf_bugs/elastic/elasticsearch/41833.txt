The reason for this is, that the keys of the aggregations are containing the type of the aggregation - which makes sense to not loose this information.\r\n\r\nHowever if I would like to implement some sort of 'pass-through` from Elasticsearch to the original client with a web application, then the Elasticsearch response gets altered compared to the original response.\r\n\r\nThe code responsible for this is in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.0/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/ParsedAggregation.java#L64 where the typed key is part of the aggregation name.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to allow this to be configurable, but I am happy to proven otherwise :-)\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to create the search request using the HLRC, then copying some code from `RequestConverters` into my code and then use the Low Level Rest Client to execute the request and retrieve a standard `Response`, which I then return to the client.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nSearchRequest request = search(queryBuilder, postFilterQuery, from, aggs);\r\nBytesRef source = XContentHelper.toXContent(request.source(), XContentType.JSON, ToXContent.EMPTY_PARAMS, true).toBytesRef();\r\n\r\nRequest lowLevelRequest = new Request(HttpPost.METHOD_NAME, INDEX + \"/_search\");\r\n// createContentType is copied from RequestConverters, as all methods are protected\r\nlowLevelRequest.setEntity(new NByteArrayEntity(source.bytes, source.offset, source.length, createContentType(XContentType.JSON)));\r\n\r\nclient.getLowLevelClient().performRequestAsync(lowLevelRequest, listener);\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
