Neither of these are recommended for tooling or applications.\r\n\r\nThis would be really useful in, for instance, the Kibana Upgrade Assistant where users might have a large of number indices that are deprecated (perhaps 100s) and their names might be very lengthy. Currently, the `_cluster/state` endpoint can result in web servers returning 414s if the names added to the URI are many and lengthy.\r\n\r\nThe Upgrade Assistant UI uses this information to warn users when an index is closed and that it will need to open and close the index while performing a reindex for upgrading.\r\n\r\n## Proposed approach\r\n\r\nI don't have a particular implementation in view other than being able to specify indices in _not_ the URI or advice on how this might be solved otherwise.","closed_by":{"login":"danhermann","id":22777892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzc3ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22777892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann","html_url":"https://github.com/danhermann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
