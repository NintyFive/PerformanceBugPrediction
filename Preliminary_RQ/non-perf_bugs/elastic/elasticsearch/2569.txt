optional parameter on the facet, like sort's \"ignore_unmapped\" parameter would be great.\n\nContext : We use \"dynamic_templates\" in our index mapping and allow clients to search, sort, and \"facet\" on any field that is valid by the rules of the mapping.\n\nThe problem arises when facets are run on fields that do not exist in the data, and thus are not \"actually\" in the mapping.\n\nExample : With a \"dynamic_template\" for \"rating-*\" fields, we can search, filter, and sort\n   (with \"ignore_unmapped\" = true), against a \"rating-Tuna\" field, even though there are no\n   documents in the index with that field.\n\nSee Gist https://gist.github.com/4568689 for a script that will quickly demonstrate the problem.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
