few documentation improvement suggestions based on user experience in the field:\n- Will be nice to add a cross reference to setting up [read only url

[restore](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/modules-snapshots.html#_restore) section of the guide.\n- Providing an example (eg. for file protocol) will be nice.\n\n```\nPUT /_snapshot/my_restore_repo\n{\n  \"type\": \"url\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"url\": \"file:///nfs/path\"\n  }\n}\n```\n- When setting up a read-only repository, only setting up repositories.url.allowed_urls is sufficient.  The statements below suggests that path.repo is also required.\n\n> \"URL Repository supports the following protocols: \"http\", \"https\", \"ftp\", \"file\" and \"jar\". URL repositories with http:, https:, and ftp: URLs has to be whitelisted by specifying allowed URLs in the repositories.url.allowed_urls setting. \"\n> \"URL repositories with file: URLs can only point to locations registered in the path.repo setting similar to shared file system repository.\"  \n","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
