is implemented by checking whether the key is in `Settings.keySet()`\r\nBut keySet returns the union of standard settings and secure settings, so this means that a setting is considered to exist if it is in _either_ `elasticsearch.yml` or `elasticsearch.keystore`\r\nHowever `Setting.get()`  does not read secure settings, so code that tries to do\r\n```\r\nif (setting.exists()) {\r\n  return setting.get();\r\n} else {\r\n // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWill do the wrong thing if the setting has been (presumably incorrectly) added to the keystore.\r\n\r\nMy proposal would be to add a `keySet(boolean includeSecureSettings)` to Settings, and have exists (in non-secure `Setting`) call that with `false`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"probakowski","id":3896475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTY0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3896475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski","html_url":"https://github.com/probakowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
