From our perspective it's too dangerous to allow this kind of flag. You are binding to non-local host you are doing serious stuff. Even if you are running in a environment it must be setup correctly. We agreed as a team to not add such a flag. Also, there is no possible solution to make everybody happy. This has been agreed as a reasonable compromise that gives us the best of both worlds. Thanks for the empathy, I appreciate it.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
