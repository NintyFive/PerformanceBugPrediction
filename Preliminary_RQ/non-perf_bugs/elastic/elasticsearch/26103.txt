I believe it is a bug because I even followed all of the steps here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/ngrams-compound-words.html and it still doesn't work. I used the sample data and their sample queries too.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nApplying a query like the one in the link above:\r\n```\r\nGET /my_index/my_type/_search\r\n{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"match\": {\r\n            \"text\": {\r\n                \"query\":                \"Gesundheit\",\r\n                \"minimum_should_match\": \"80%\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nreturns the same results with minimum_should_match that it does without it.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something? Did something change with minimum_should_match in 5.x, or is this a bug?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
