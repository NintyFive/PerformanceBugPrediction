I think the following should be accepted (if not the only default): \n\n```\nPUT index\n{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"analysis\": {\n      \"analyzer\": {\n        \"my_analyzer\": {\n          \"tokenizer\": \"whitespace\",\n          \"token_filters\": [ <--- broken (expects \"filter\")\n            \"lowercase\",\n            \"stop\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt's very easy to change the code to accept both `filter`, `filters` and `token_filters` but I tend to think that  we should go strict here and say we only accept `token_filters` and automatically upgrade existing setting when we recover. This will require (some) more work as that infra is not there yet.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
