explained in #19144 we could create a new plugin named `discovery-azure-arm` which is based on the [newest versions of the Azure SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/Azure-SDK-for-Java-Features).\n\nClassic was based on private key / password which was bad for what we want to achieve with such a plugin.\nARM uses now key / secrets which are really much more flexible and safer.\n\nBasically you can now write code like [this example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/Getting-Started#client-creation):\n\n``` java\nComputeManagementClient client;\n\n// Default environment, no credentials\nclient = new ComputeManagementClientImpl();\n\n// Custom environment with AzureChinaCloud endpoint\nString chinaCloudEndpoint = \"https://management.chinacloudapi.cn/\";\nclient = new ComputeManagementClientImpl(chinaCloudEndpoint);\n\n// Default environment with credentials\nApplicationTokenCredentials credentials = new ApplicationTokenCredentials(\n        \"client-id\", \"tenant-id\", \"secret\", null);\nclient = new ComputeManagementClientImpl(credentials);\n\n// Custom environment with credentials\nclient = new ComputeManagementClientImpl(chinaCloudEndpoint, credentials);\n\n// Fully customized, with HTTP client and Retrofit modifiable\nclient = new ComputeManagementClientImpl(\n        chinaCloudEndpoint,\n        credentials,\n        new OkHttpClient.Builder(),\n        new Retrofit.Builder());\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
