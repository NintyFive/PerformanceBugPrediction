It definitely could be too niche.  Processing the tree into a text value is doable, but introduces a variety of problems.  For example, take this tree:\n\n```\nquery:\n  match:\n    baz: abc,\n  bool:\n    must:\n      match:\n        bar: xyz\n      match:\n        baz: abc\n```\n\nHow do you transform that into a textual value?  Assuming there is still some kind of processor that understand JSON and can emit node names:\n- Go depth-first which maintains subtree structure:  `match baz bool must match bar match baz`.  \n- Go breadth-first which maintains per-level co-ocurrence:  `match bool baz must match match bar baz`.  \n- Go depth-first, but generate a value for each \"branch\" in the tree:  `[\"match baz\", \"bool must match bar\", \"bool must match baz\"]`, and then use a bunch of phrase magic to accomplish per-level co-ocurrence.\n\nI dunno, I'll keep playing.  Maybe one of those above schemes will work nicely when combined with MinHash/SimHash/Winnowing.  I definitely agree it doesn't make sense to have functionality that is special-purpose and not generally useful\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/196913636","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16938#issuecomment-196913636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16938","id":196913636,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjkxMzYzNg==","user":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T16:39:54Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T16:39:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, so I've been mulling this over.  I think we can simplify this proposal down to just \"content fingerprinting\" with a variety of algorithms.  \n\nIn the place of \"structural fingerprinting\", I think we should have a second ingest processor that is essentially a \"recursive JSON flattener\" processor.  Given a JSON _string_ (rather than a complete JSON document), it flattens it into one or several fields, according to your configurations (all keys in one field, keys-per-level fields, prepending level to key name, etc).  This also sidesteps the mapping explosion issue, since it requires the JSON to be in string form.\n\nTo accomplish structural fingerprinting, you just run it through the \"flattener\" first to get a set of regular fields, then use content fingerprinting.  More generic, flexible, can be used with entirely different processor chains.
