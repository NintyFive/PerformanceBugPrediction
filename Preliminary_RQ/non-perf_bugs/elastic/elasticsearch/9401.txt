(This means that this is _not_ the same as applying it to `/_all/_settings`, which would modify any existing, open index)\n\nThis is probably very much related to the improvements planned by #6732\n\nFor anyone that needs this now, you _can_ workaround this issue by creating/updating a base catch-all index template:\n\n``` json\nPUT /_template/base_slowlog_template\n{\n  \"template\" : \"*\",\n  \"order\" : 0,\n  \"settings\" : {\n    \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.info\" : \"100ms\"\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
