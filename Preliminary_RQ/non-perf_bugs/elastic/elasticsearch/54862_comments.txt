We would need to write additional behaviour to be able to send an explicitly set `null` value in the request, to be able to distinguish it from a `nullable int` default value in the `docs_per_second` case. \r\n\r\nLooks like the Java client sends a `-1` in the case of `null`? https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/e177a385044884ffb530a157cb7224631178d92c/client/rest-high-level/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/client/transform/transforms/SettingsConfig.java#L132-L144\r\n\r\n(/cc @elastic/es-clients) ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/637311197","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/54862#issuecomment-637311197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/54862","id":637311197,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzMxMTE5Nw==","user":{"login":"karmi","id":4790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi","html_url":"https://github.com/karmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-02T06:38:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-02T06:38:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed that `null` values are hard to implement (and semantically somewhat empty), and that `-1`, especially for numerical values, makes more sense.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/637973760","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/54862#issuecomment-637973760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/54862","id":637973760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzk3Mzc2MA==","user":{"login":"hendrikmuhs","id":7126422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7126422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrikmuhs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T06:01:32Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T06:01:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@russcam \r\n\r\nBoth is possible `null` _or_ `-1`.
