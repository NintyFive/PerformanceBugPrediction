This is probably something better asked on the forum. In general highlighting is funky and its kind of \"best effort\" so this isn't so much a bug as yet another wart. But its cool to keep it here because most of the rest of Elasticsearch is less funky and things should work.\n2. You should totally surround stuff in ``` for multiline code blocks or ` for inline code blocks. It makes reading these easier.\n3. Requests you include in issues should include the `pretty` url parameter. The responses should be generated with that. They are so much easier to scan!\n4. I think your issue is actually caused by the way in which highlighting extracts the terms to highlight - can you try using the `terms` query instead of the `terms` filter?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/163088544","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15270#issuecomment-163088544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15270","id":163088544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzA4ODU0NA==","user":{"login":"shagga","id":16184439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTg0NDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16184439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shagga","html_url":"https://github.com/shagga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shagga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shagga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shagga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shagga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shagga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shagga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shagga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shagga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shagga/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-09T02:42:25Z","updated_at":"2015-12-09T02:42:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks Nik !!
