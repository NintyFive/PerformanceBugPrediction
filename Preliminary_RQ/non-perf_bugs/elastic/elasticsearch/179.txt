This should not happen. Instead, the caches should be explicitly cleared and GC should not be called. The new `clear_cache_threshold` replaces the `gc_threshold`.\n\nAlso, because of this change, there is no need for a scheduler to run on the soft/weak filter caches.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
