I created a document type called **questions** which has a child document type called **answers**. The answers document has a **date** field. Once I insert sample data in elasticsearch, I can query the **answers** document successfully with a date range query. However, the has_child query does not return any results when the date range query utilizes any date value that precedes the answer dates. The following steps explain the issue further.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1) Create an index called \"sandbox\"\n\n```\nPUT /sandbox\n```\n\n2) Create a document mapping for \"answers\" with a parent type of \"questions\".\n\n```\nPUT /sandbox/_mapping/answers\n{\n  \"_parent\": {\n      \"type\": \"questions\" \n  }\n  , \"properties\": {\n    \"answer\" : {\"type\": \"text\"},\n    \"date\" : {\"type\": \"date\"}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3) Add a \"questions\" document\n\n```\nPUT /sandbox/questions/1\n{\n  \"question\" : \"Why is the sky blue?\"\n}\n```\n\n4) Add a couple of \"answers\" document\n\n```\nPUT /sandbox/answers/1?parent=1\n{\n  \"answer\" : \"Due to scattering of sunlight\",\n  \"date\" : \"2016-05-01\"\n}\n```\n\n```\nPUT /sandbox/answers/2?parent=1\n{\n  \"answer\" : \"Due to refraction of light\",\n  \"date\" : \"2016-06-01\"\n}\n```\n\n5) Find all answers with a date value of gte \"2016-04-01\". \nTHIS WORKS AS EXPECTED. It returns the 2 answers documents as expected.\n\n```\nGET /sandbox/answers/_search\n{\n  \"query\" : {\n    \"range\": {\n      \"date\": {\n        \"gte\": \"2016-04-01\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n6) Now use the has_child query to get questions with answers that have date gte \"2016-04-01\". \n**DOES NOT WORK AS EXPECTED**. This returns 0 hits. I expected the 1 \"questions\" document in the response.\n\n```\nGET /sandbox/questions/_search\n{\n  \"query\" : {\n    \"has_child\": {\n      \"type\": \"answers\",\n      \"query\": {\n        \"range\": {\n          \"date\": {\n            \"gte\": \"2016-04-01\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
