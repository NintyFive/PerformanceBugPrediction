The problem is [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/rest/action/cat/RestIndicesAction.java#L75), you can never get back closed indices through cat indices unless you refer to them explicitly. @drewr can you comment on this? This is probably the only cat api where showing closed indices might make sense, then we might want to change how we resolve wildcards internally?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/88867125","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10242#issuecomment-88867125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10242","id":88867125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4ODY3MTI1","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-02T11:12:32Z","updated_at":"2015-04-02T11:12:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ping @drew @dakrone what do you think?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/237486153","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10242#issuecomment-237486153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10242","id":237486153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzQ4NjE1Mw==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-04T08:22:50Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T08:22:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This was solved by #18545 in version 2.3.4 and 5.0.0-alpha3.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
