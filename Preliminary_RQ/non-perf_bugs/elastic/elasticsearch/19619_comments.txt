For aggregations, we should try to fix time parsing so that eg `10y` works, but date histograms use calendars which is why it makes sense to do it there.  The decay functions don't use calendars - just a distance from a point.  So `10y` isn't going to take leap years etc into account.\n\nI think it is correct to only expose the units that have a real meaning here.  If you want to use 3 months in decay functions, then you need to decide how many days that should be (because a day has a determined length, but a month doesn't).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/235930096","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19619#issuecomment-235930096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19619","id":235930096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTkzMDA5Ng==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T15:27:00Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T15:27:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I think it is correct to only expose the units that have a real meaning here.\n\nBy extension of that, we should not support days. Due to daylight savings time, 1 day a year has 23 hours, and 1 day has 25 hours. Hours is the highest granularity that does not change (if you don't count leapseconds!)\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
