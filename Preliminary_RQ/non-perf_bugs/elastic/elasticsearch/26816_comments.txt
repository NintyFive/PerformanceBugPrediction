We keep github for bugs and feature requests. For questions and more general discussions we use our forums on http://discuss.elastic.co . Do you mind asking there? I'm going to close this. If it turns out that there is some bug that prevents you from doing what you want we can always reopen. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
