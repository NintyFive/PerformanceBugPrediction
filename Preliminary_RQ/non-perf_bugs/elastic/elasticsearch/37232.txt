Upgrading to Lucene 7.6.0 should solve this issue (but might cause other issues ;-).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a simple index with synonyms:\r\n\r\n`curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/zork  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d '{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"index\": {\r\n            \"analysis\": {\r\n                \"analyzer\": {\r\n                    \"synonym\": {\r\n                        \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",\r\n                        \"filter\": [\r\n                            \"my_synonyms\"\r\n                        ]\r\n                    }\r\n                },\r\n                \"filter\": {\r\n                    \"my_synonyms\": {\r\n                        \"type\": \"synonym_graph\",\r\n                        \"synonyms\": [\r\n                        \t\"developer, software engineer\"\r\n                        \t]\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    \"mappings\": {\r\n        \"jobs\": {\r\n            \"properties\": {\r\n                \"title\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\r\n                    \"analyzer\": \"standard\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}'`\r\n\r\n 2. Add two documents:\r\n\r\n`curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/zork/jobs/1 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"title\": \"PHP Web developer\"}'`\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n`curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/zork/jobs/2 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"title\": \"Web developer (PHP)\"}'`\r\n\r\n 3. Search:\r\n\r\nwithout synonym analyzer: 2 results\r\n\r\n`curl -X POST  http://localhost:9200/zork/_search  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d '{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"match_phrase\": {\r\n            \"title\": {\r\n            \t\"query\": \"php developer\",\r\n\t            \"slop\": 5,\r\n\t            \"analyzer\": \"standard\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}'`\r\n\r\nwith synonym analyzer: 1 result\r\n\r\n`curl -X POST  http://localhost:9200/zork/_search  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d '{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"match_phrase\": {\r\n            \"title\": {\r\n            \t\"query\": \"php developer\",\r\n\t            \"slop\": 5,\r\n\t            \"analyzer\": \"synonym\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}'`","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
