Entering the variables without the brackets (as shown), I then ran: \r\n```\r\nexport HOST1=\"127.0.0.1\"\r\nexport HOST2=\"127.0.0.1:12\"\r\nexport HOSTNAME=\"valhalla\"\r\n```\r\nI then started Elasticsearch, which started normally. My takeaway is that brackets are not required when passing multiple variables in `elasticsearch.yml`. I think that we can enhance the examples in the [Environment variable substitution](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html#_environment_variable_substitution) section to show multiple variables and indicate that brackets are not required.\r\n\r\n@rjernst, can you please review my findings and let me know if I'm on the right track? I'm still learning who does what, but I think that this is your area of expertise. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
