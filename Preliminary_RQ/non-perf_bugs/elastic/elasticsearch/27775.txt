I have 3 nodes and my dataset is one index with 1 primary shard and 2 replicas.\r\n\r\nI would expect elasticsearch to distribute every query across the nodes but it does to load balance the queries. If I run all the queries separately using `_search` on the command line they are distributed across all nodes as expected and return much faster because it uses all the nodes instead of a single one.\r\n\r\nI do not know if this is an expected behavior or a bug, but I believe that would be much better if elasticsearch would be able to multiplex queries submitted with `_msearch` across all the nodes to exploit the parallelism.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
