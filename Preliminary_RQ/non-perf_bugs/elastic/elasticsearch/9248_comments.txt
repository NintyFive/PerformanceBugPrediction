I hear you and your are right. The disk threshold allocator will give you some more flexibility here, if you have the space for it.

But when talking to someone at ElasticON, they said it sounds like a bug and to create an issue.  Was about to try do that and came across this issue.  Glad I'm not the only one.  \n\nHaven't gone through to try to recreate this on 1.4.4.  We are currently on 1.4.2.  We are running a 3 node cluster, 3 primary, 1 replica, with daily rolling indexes.  There's probably about 12 indexes per day.  Of those, 2 are very large/hot.  We really care that those are distributed evenly (we are on spinning disk and pretty constrained w/ memory so anything we can do to balance it across the cluster, the better).  In fact, we'd just prefer everything get distributed evenly.  I've tried to play with `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.*` but that didn't seem to help.  Meant to go back and see if it was better but also saw this issue #9023 which sounds like I might want to upgrade to >= 1.4.4 first.  Anyways, that's all the background that lead us to trying this setting.  \n\nSeems the issue is clear now?
