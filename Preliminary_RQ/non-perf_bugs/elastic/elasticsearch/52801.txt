I feel there is a discrepancy in how the `search` and `_search/template` endpoints behave regarding the reported number of hits.\r\n\r\nIn my tests below, I'm querying an index with more than 10000 documents with the exact same JSON query (as a normal query and as a template query depending on which endpoint I'm targeting).\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"query\": {\r\n        \"match_all\": {}\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nA. When using the `_search` endpoint, I get this:\r\n\r\n    \"total\" : {\r\n      \"value\" : 10000,\r\n      \"relation\" : \"gte\"\r\n    },\r\n\r\nB. When using the `_search?rest_total_hits_as_int=true` endpoint, I get this:\r\n\r\n    \"total\" : 173175,\r\n\r\nC. When using the `_search/template` endpoint, I get this:\r\n\r\n    \"total\" : {\r\n      \"value\" : 10000,\r\n      \"relation\" : \"gte\"\r\n    },\r\n\r\nSo far, so good, everything is consistent.\r\n\r\nD. But when I hit the `_search/template?rest_total_hits_as_int=true` endpoint, I get this:\r\n\r\n    \"total\" : 10000,\r\n\r\nThe only way I found to get the exact total with the `_search/template` endpoint is by adding the `\"track_total_hits\": true` parameter to the template query.\r\n\r\nE. When doing so, I get this when hitting the `_search/template` endpoint\r\n\r\n    \"total\" : {\r\n      \"value\" : 173175,\r\n      \"relation\" : \"eq\"\r\n    },\r\n\r\nF. and this when when hitting the `_search/template?rest_total_hits_as_int=true` endpoint\r\n\r\n    \"total\" : 173175,\r\n\r\nThere are two take-aways here:\r\n 1. Since A and C are consistent, I feel that B and D should also be consistent.\r\n 2. I also think that B is wrong and should require `\"track_total_hits\": true` in the query in order to spit out the exact number of hits (like in cases E and F)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nIt's easy to reproduce this on any index that has more than 10K documents and creating a simple `match_all` template query.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
