It is not a frequency but an absolute value. The problem that actual value for index depends on number of documents in the index - larger indexes requires larger values to filter out domain specific stop words. \n\nI found that XMoreLikeThis actually has `setMaxDocFreqPct(int maxPercentage)` method that recalculates percentage to actual number of documents in index.\n\nHowever, this method is not available to client. I would be great if you add it to java client and HTTP API.\n","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
