If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\nI also tried to reproduce what you're stating but was not successful. With your configuration the following request issued from the machine where the Docker container is running, produced a valid response:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Origin: http://localhost:5555' localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty\r\n```\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity I tried a more specific CORS configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp.cors.enabled: true\r\nhttp.cors.allow-origin: \"http://4.4.4.4:5555\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nrebuilt the container and tried a positive and a negative case.
