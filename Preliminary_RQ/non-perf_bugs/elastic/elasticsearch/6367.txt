Help me please, I'm confused. As far as I remember, there was the only way to pass filters to search query - via filtered query. But currently there is a top-level `filter` part of the query. However, top-level `filter` affects `query` only and doesn't affect i.e. `facets`. But filtered query filter affects both of the `query` and `facets` facilities. Also, I remember there was a time I need to add `match_all` query to filtered `query` section if query was empty and filters only was present. Otherwise returned empty set of documents. Since I'm trying to create high-level Ruby library could you please answer following questions:\n\n1) Which way is preferred now and in future: filtered top-level query or top-level filter with top-level query?\n2) How do you plan to resolve such an API inconsistency when filtered query filter affects outside statements and top-level filter doesn't affect some parts of request?\n3) Why do I remember about `match_all` feature and when did requests started to return  all the documents with empty query section in filtered query? I'm checking it right now on 1.2.0 and I don't need to use `match_all`, or `constant_score` it just returns all the docs for me.\n\nThanks in advance.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
