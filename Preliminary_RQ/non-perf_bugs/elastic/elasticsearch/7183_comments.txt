So, could you ask this question on the [elasticsearch mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/elasticsearch) instead? In short the answer to your question is aggregations are computed when an aggregation query comes, but because of data structures that elasticsearch is using, they can computed in very efficient manner. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/51428584","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7183#issuecomment-51428584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7183","id":51428584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDI4NTg0","user":{"login":"fireflyk","id":3302978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDI5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3302978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireflyk","html_url":"https://github.com/fireflyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireflyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireflyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireflyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireflyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireflyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireflyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireflyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireflyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireflyk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-07T03:58:29Z","updated_at":"2014-08-07T03:58:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for answering.
