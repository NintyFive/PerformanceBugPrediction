am having issues right now because I need to build Elasticsearch in a Docker image and I need a way to build it behind a proxy. Almost every other tool I have used in my containers work just fine if I pass in the `http_proxy` environment variables. It is a lot cleaner than having to build my container specifically to allow building behind a proxy.\r\n\r\nIf you don't handle the environment variables in the tool, you make everybody who has to use the tool behind a proxy work to get it running. If you *do* handle it in the tool you fix the issue once and for all. I understand that it complicates a script, but IMHO it is better to fix it once instead of having your users work around the fact that it isn't supported.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
