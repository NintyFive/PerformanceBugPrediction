Alex,\nI found the following interesting things.\nThis is the original command from FreeBSD elasticsearch startup script.\n\n```\n/usr/local/openjdk6/bin/java -Des.pidfile=/var/run/elasticsearch.pid

/usr/local/lib/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-0.90.11.jar:/usr/local/lib/elasticsearch/*:/usr/local/lib/elasticsearch/sigar/* org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.ElasticSearch\n```\n\nI'm testing the following:\nDelete all the files in \"/usr/local/lib/elasticsearch\" and copy the v1.0.0 files there.\nIt did, by the way with all .090.x versions without problem.\n\nChanged \"elasticsearch-0.90.11.jar\" to \"elasticsearch-1.0.0.jar\" and start the command new,\nbut i get directly this ClassNotFoundException.\n\nHowever i can v1.0.0 with the original startup-scrip from elasticsearch distribution start.\nThis ist the start command from this script.\n\n```\n/usr/local/openjdk6/bin/java -Xms256m -Xmx1g -Xss256k -Djava.awt.headless=true -XX:+UseParNewGC

This is a not-so-funny way of looking at the Debian distribution. In reality, the official Debian packages are *always* the ones which are part of the distribution. I appreciate it when young projects provide their own .deb packages until the project eventually gets included in the distribution, but this is not the case here. The package is part of the official distribution and is broken. This is a problem that should be resolved rather than ignored. You can either ask the Debian project to remove it from the distribution, or you can help the maintainer fix the problems. I also want to point out that the Elasticsearch website itself suggests to download the software via APT and it's not stressed enough that it shouldn't be done with the official distribution source but rather with another repository.\r\n\r\n=> Can someone reopen this issue please ?
