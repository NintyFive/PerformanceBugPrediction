Due to how document type mappings are parsed, we always start out with the defaults, and anything we parse is merged with the default. What we need is to not add the default metadata mappers until after parsing, when we are creating a new mapping type. It used to be difficult, but I think with recent changes this may be possible now.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
