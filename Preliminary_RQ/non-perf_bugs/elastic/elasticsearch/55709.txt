For reference, the full script used in this query is\r\n\r\n```\r\n            \"script\": {\r\n              \"source\": \"InternalQlScriptUtils.nullSafeFilter(InternalQlScriptUtils.eq(InternalQlScriptUtils.eq(InternalQlScriptUtils.docValue(doc,params.v0),params.v1),params.v2))\",\r\n              \"lang\": \"painless\",\r\n              \"params\": {\r\n                \"v0\": \"source.address\",\r\n                \"v1\": \"192.168.0.0/16\",\r\n                \"v2\": true\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when the `cidrMatch` function is being used standalone (and the Painless script is not needed) eql ES falls back to a `term` query of the form\r\n\r\n```\r\n        {\r\n          \"term\": {\r\n            \"source.address\": {\r\n              \"value\": \"192.168.0.0/16\",\r\n              \"boost\": 1\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat does the right thing and knows about the cidr notation and matches the query.\r\nI think we need a cidrMatch method to be used in scripts that will do whatever `term` query does with an IP field.","closed_by":{"login":"aleksmaus","id":872351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjM1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/872351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus","html_url":"https://github.com/aleksmaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
