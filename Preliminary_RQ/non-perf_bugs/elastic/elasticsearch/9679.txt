In #9058 we are working on simplifying where the explicit timestamp is specified.\n\nI propose we actually have a single field, `_expiration`, which takes the behavior of both.  Internally, `_ttl` already indexes the actual expiration time, so that it can be queried later to do the deletes.  `_expiration` would be a much better and direct name for this field, and can have the following settings:\n- required - do we enforce expiration is set in indexing requests?\n- default_ttl - same as the default in _ttl now (cannot be used with required)\n\nThe parameters for indexing could then be `expiration` which is an explicit datetime to expire, or `ttl` which has the same behavior as today.  One and only one of these parameters would be allowed, and one would be required if the required flag was set.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
