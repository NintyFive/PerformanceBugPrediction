This is what curl does when using the `-d` flag (although it does not change the form of the value to match the `var=val&var2=val2` format).\nThe latter parameters are called POST parameters in PHP.\nWhen coding a PHP webpage, one will make sure of the origin of the parameter, preventing easy parameter injection by modifying the URL, so that only user friendly parameters are exposed as GET parameters through the URL, and making sure the other one do come from the request body as POST parameters.\n\n**To conclude:** GET and POST parameters somehow separate the presentation from the data.\nThis is why I proposed reading only POST parameters for a `POST` to the Update Settings API, leaving GET parameters only configure the presentation of the answer.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
