This filter is only applied AFTER your query has been run and aggregations have been calculated.  So it removes results from the `hits`, but the results will still be taken into account by aggregations.  Instead, you should use a `filtered` query.\n\nNext, I note that you're querying the `content` index, but the document is actually in `content-1`. I assume `content` is actually an alias? (This should work regardless)\n\nThen, like you, I'm unable to replicate this locally on 1.5.0.  Please could you upload the output of the following:\n\nMapping for all fields:\n\n```\nGET content/_mapping\n```\n\nMapping for `_field_names`:\n\n```\nGET content/_mapping/field/_field_names?include_defaults\n```\n\nExplanation of query: \n\n```\nPOST /content-1/_validate/query?explain\n```\n\nValues in `_field_names` for this document: \n\n```\nPOST /content/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"_id\": \"5c7aca72-f1fd-48dd-b2ee-1ed6d3ef134b\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"fielddata_fields\": [\"_field_names\"]\n}\n```\n\nAn explanation of how this document matched:\n\n```\nPOST /content-1/share-site-article/5c7aca72-f1fd-48dd-b2ee-1ed6d3ef134b/_explain\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"query\": {\n        \"match\": {\n          \"_all\": \"X and Y presents\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"and\": {\n          \"filters\": [\n            {\n              \"missing\": {\n                \"field\": \"nativeAdCampaignName\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"term\": {\n                \"_id\": \"5c7aca72-f1fd-48dd-b2ee-1ed6d3ef134b\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"term\": {\n                \"_site\": \"docs\"\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/93035675","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10590#issuecomment-93035675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10590","id":93035675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzMDM1Njc1","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-14T19:41:21Z","updated_at":"2015-04-14T19:41:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dling Was your index created before 1.3?
