It's possible that this is the case. I am not sure how SLC6 kernel version numbering corresponds to RedHat, but I will check this with sysadmins if we're affected (our kernel is 2.6.32-504.3.3.el6.x86_64).\n\nYes, unstacking always seem to work. In fact it is simpler (qucker) to do it using gstack. I supposed that it is a synchronisation problem, so if trapping threads enforces synchronisation, it gets them out of that loop. Also they actually use a lot of CPU (spin over the lock I guess..).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/111433591","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11526#issuecomment-111433591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11526","id":111433591,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTQzMzU5MQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-12T09:55:27Z","updated_at":"2015-06-12T09:55:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@smorovic have you managed to confirm whether this is the futex bug yet?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/111438956","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11526#issuecomment-111438956","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11526","id":111438956,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTQzODk1Ng==","user":{"login":"smorovic","id":5859622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTk2MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5859622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smorovic","html_url":"https://github.com/smorovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smorovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smorovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smorovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smorovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smorovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smorovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smorovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smorovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smorovic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-12T10:18:18Z","updated_at":"2015-06-12T10:18:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\nWe suffer from exactly the same symptoms as described here, so apparently it is a futex bug (we will however update out machines with a new kernel next week).
