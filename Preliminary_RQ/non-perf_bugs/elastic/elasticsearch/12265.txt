This unexpected type also has a dynamically derived explicit(?) mapping which is also unexpected.\n\nIf you add a more templates and documents in the same manner (using `wtsecond` and `second-type` etc.), the same thing continues to happen. However if you add a third or more in the same manner and `index.mapper.dynamic` is `false`, then a `TypeMissingException` is thrown on the third document creation.\n\nThe effect on mappings for types becomes unclear when later adding documents for the pre-created/not-created types. This problem appears on tested versions 1.4.0, 1.5.1 and 1.6.0.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
