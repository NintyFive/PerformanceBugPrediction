So, right now, if I register a query using the percolator:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_percolator/test/kuku -d '{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"term\" : {\n            \"field1\" : \"value1\"\n        }\n    }\n}'\n```\n\nand I percolate a matching document\n\n```\ncurl -XGET localhost:9200/test/type1/_percolate -d '{\n    \"doc\" : {\n        \"field1\" : \"value1\"\n    }\n}'\n```\n\nI get something of the effect back:\n\n```\n{\"ok\":true, \"matches\":[\"kuku\"]}\n```\n\nWhich a fine way of doing things, but I think it'd be nicer to be able to register metadata along with the query. So, something of the effect:\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_percolator/test/ -d '{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"term\" : {\n            \"field1\" : \"value1\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"campaign\": 1,\n        \"user_id\": 1,\n        \"user_name\": kuku\n    }\n}'\n```\n\nIf a document matched, I'd get something like this back:\n\n```\n{\"ok\":true, \"matches\":[{\"_id\": \"BzA9dR7OSqGylX-0y80IJA\", \"campaign\": 1, \"user_id\": 1, \"user_name\": kuku}]}\n```\n\nCurrently, if I need to store more information about a query, I need to do hacks, such as concatenating strings with all the information I want to get back from that match (example: \"campaign:1-id:1-name:kuku\") to use as the id of that document, but that has drawbacks.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
