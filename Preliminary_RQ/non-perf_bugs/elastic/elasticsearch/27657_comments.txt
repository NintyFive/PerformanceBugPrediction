We are porting old application with it's requirements and sometimes have to generate huge terms queries.It's the only way to fulfill requirements.\r\n\r\nES fits most of the requirements we have except some corner cases (what a surprise! we have corner cases). The situation with slices and big queries is just one of them. In other cases we wrote plugins.\r\n\r\nThe general goal of the PR is to remove client side inefficiency of generating a payload for every slice. With the url parameter the payload can be generated once, compressed once, and reused for every sliced scroll request\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/368025605","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27657#issuecomment-368025605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27657","id":368025605,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODAyNTYwNQ==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-23T14:35:15Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T14:35:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry for the delay, I hope you don't mind if I close this, generating the payload for a slice should not be the the limiting factor (query should be small).
