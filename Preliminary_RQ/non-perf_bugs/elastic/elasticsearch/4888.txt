I've been using the [fields](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-fields.html) to limit the fields I want to receive.\n\nSome of the desired fields are non-leaf fields. With `1.0.0.RC1`, I get an error `ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException[field [price] isn't a leaf field]`.\n\nHere is a simplified mapping : \n\n``` json\n{\n   \"partner_results\": {\n      \"mappings\": {\n         \"result\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n               \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"index\": \"not_analyzed\" },\n               \"price\": {\n                  \"properties\": {\n                     \"avg_cents\": { \"type\": \"long\" },\n                     \"currency\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n                     \"total_cents\": { \"type\": \"long\" }\n}}}}}}}\n```\n\nThe request : \n\n``` json\n{\n  \"fields\":[\"name\", \"price\"],\n    \"query\" : { \"term\" : { \"name\" : \"kimchy\" }\n}}\n```\n\nThe response : \n\n``` json\n{\n  \"took\": 2,\n  \"timed_out\": false,\n  \"_shards\": {\n    \"total\": 2,\n    \"successful\": 1,\n    \"failed\": 1,\n    \"failures\": [{\n      \"index\": \"partner_results\",\n      \"shard\": 4,\n      \"status\": 400,\n      \"reason\": \"ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException[field [price] isn't a leaf field]\"\n    }]\n  },\n  \"hits\": {\n    \"total\": 34,\n    \"max_score\": 1.0,\n    \"hits\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI haven't found anything in the 1.0 documentation nor in the \"breaking changes\" about that.\nIs there a solution?\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
