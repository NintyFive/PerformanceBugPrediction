We did this for a few reasons:\r\n1. The static tests played a lot of tricks to get everything to run in the same JVM so they weren't \"real\". This caused them to miss things from time to time. The `qa:full-cluster-restart` project has no such problems.\r\n2. It is more difficult to reason about the static backwards compatibility tests because the static indexes are just binary blobs built by a python script. We have to be careful to keep it up to date, etc. The indices built by `qa:full-cluster-restart` are built at testing time so any changes to the index building code apply immediately.\r\n3. Checking binary blobs into the code is icky.\r\n\r\nThere are a bunch of pieces left to port from the static tests to `qa:full-cluster-restart`:\r\n* [x] RestoreBackwardsCompatIT.testRestoreOldSnapshots @nik9000 #25296\r\n* [x] RepositoryUpgradabilityIT @nik9000 #25296\r\n* [x] OldIndexBackwardsCompatibilityIT#assertBasicSearchWorks @martijnvg #24954\r\n* [x] OldIndexBackwardsCompatibilityIT#assertAllSearchWorks @martijnvg #25173\r\n* [x] OldIndexBackwardsCompatibilityIT#assertBasicAggregationWorks @martijnvg #25173\r\n* [x] OldIndexBackwardsCompatibilityIT#assertRealtimeGetWorks @martijnvg #25173\r\n* [x] OldIndexBackwardsCompatibilityIT#assertNewReplicasWork @martijnvg #25173\r\n* [x] OldIndexBackwardsCompatibilityIT#assertUpgradeWorks @martijnvg #25275\r\n* [x] ~~OldIndexBackwardsCompatibilityIT#assertPositionIncrementGapDefaults (maybe not a big deal anymore because these are mostly for the 2.x -> 5.0 upgrade)~~\r\n* [x] OldIndexBackwardsCompatibilityIT#assertAliasWithBadName @martijnvg #25275\r\n* [x] OldIndexBackwardsCompatibilityIT#assertStoredBinaryFields @martijnvg #25275\r\n\r\nThere are a few things we need to clean up before we can remove a bunch of infrastructure for static bwc tests. I don't claim to know how to clean them all up:\r\n* [ ] RestoreBackwardsCompatIT.testRestoreUnsupportedSnapshots\r\n* [ ] RecoveryWithUnsupportedIndicesIT and StaticIndexBackwardCompatibilityIT\r\n* [x] Remove create_bwc_index.py #26109\r\n* [x] Update \"how to release\" docs to remove \"run create_bwc_index.py\" (https://github.com/elastic/dev/commit/f12bf0a50bd4534942142b8904481acd8440033b)\r\n* [x] Remove static indices and repositories #26109\r\n\r\nAnd there are a bunch of things to add:\r\n* [ ] Lenient boolean backwards compatibility tests\r\n* [x] Shrunken indexes (we've had trouble with them in the past) #25720\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
