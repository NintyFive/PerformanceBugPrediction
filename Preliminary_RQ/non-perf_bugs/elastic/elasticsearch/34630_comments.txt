Thanks for pointing this out. \r\n\r\nIn terms of what needs to be done to have a freeze index action in ILM, we will need to implement a new ILM action and an `AsyncActionStep` to call the freeze API (it looks from the docs like the freeze API only returns when the index is frozen so I don't think we'll need a subsequent step to check the action has been completed like in other ILM actions). We will also need to update the allowed actions in the cold phase to allow the new freeze action. The `ForcemergeAction` might be a good template to use to see how an action is implemented.\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions you have ðŸ˜„ ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/445336272","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34630#issuecomment-445336272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34630","id":445336272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTMzNjI3Mg==","user":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-07T19:16:21Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T19:16:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@simonw I'm happy to help.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/449130316","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34630#issuecomment-449130316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34630","id":449130316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTEzMDMxNg==","user":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-20T20:46:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T20:46:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"implementation can be found in this PR: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/36910 ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
