You’ve ignored our template, not given any steps to reproduce, and dropped a stack trace in our laps without any context. Please help us help you.\r\n\r\nUnable to create new native thread is almost always an indication that you’ve hit a resource limit. For example a memory limit or an rlimit (e.g., max processes). This is rarely indicative of our a problem on our side, usually it’s one on yours. \r\n\r\nAnd anyway, this in the stacktrace is completely out of place:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.voxlearning.alps.remote.hydra.client.channel.ClientChannel.lambda$new$0(ClientChannel.java:70)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you see how `elasticsearch` never appears in the stacktrace anywhere?  Is this purely client side then? That is unlikely to be us, instead you. Check your rlimit as a start.\r\n\r\nI am treating this as not a bug report, instead as a user question.  There's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
