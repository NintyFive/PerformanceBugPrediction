However, providing a timezone delta, like `{ts '2000-01-01T11:11:11Z'}` will fail with `\"line 1:9: Invalid timestamp received; Text '2000-01-01T11:11:11Z' could not be parsed, unparsed text found at index 19\"`.\r\n\r\nI believe we should be able to parse an ISO timestamp literal.\r\n\r\n(As a side note, casting a string as a `timestamp` is currently quite flexible, all combination are supported: `SELECT CAST('2000-01-01T11:11:11Z' AS timestamp)`, `2000-01-01 11:11:11` (also expected), and `2000-01-01T11:11:11` or even `'2000-01-01 11:11:11Z`.)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
