We do plan to build a second cluster in a backup data center that we could fail over to.  But that is many months away.\n\nThis is also pretty different than the story that I heard at Elasticon regarding sealed indexes making rolling restarts faster and simpler.  We were planning on doing them _more_ often with support from that one day.\n\nIs the trouble writes during the restart?  Merges?\n\nNot supporting rolling restart would have caused us not to select Elasticsearch.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/83011549","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10118#issuecomment-83011549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10118","id":83011549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMDExNTQ5","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-18T15:02:32Z","updated_at":"2015-03-18T15:02:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this PR needs some clarification. IMO the relevant versions that are risky to upgrade are 1.3.x and 1.4.x where a lot of checksum problems were uncovered. We had false positives on old lucene 3.x segments as well as truncation issues due to the way recoveries worked. In the upcoming release (planned for next week) of Elasticsearch `1.5.0` all known issues related to this are resolved and it's safe to do a rolling upgrade. I think this PR should specify the risky version rather than making a general statement.\n\nI also would love the users to not get paranoid about this, we have not even had a review cycle on this PR. We operate very open here and obviously don't want to hold this information back from anybody but there is no reason for get worried that this won't get resolved. I can assure you we spend almost all our time these days on infrastructure and stability that's also a reason why `1.5.0` doesn't have that many user-facing features. There will likely be a `1.6.0` release with https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10032 to improve this situation dramatically. So stay tuned we are working on all ends.\n\n> Being able to upgrade a live system and in a backwards compatible way (and being able to roll back the changes if needed) should be a core principle for all distributed systems. \n\nyou can downgrade unless you have written to the new cluster. I personally don't know a lot of systems that are forwards compatible to be honest :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/162243729","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10118#issuecomment-162243729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10118","id":162243729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjI0MzcyOQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-05T20:33:08Z","updated_at":"2015-12-05T20:33:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No longer relevant\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
