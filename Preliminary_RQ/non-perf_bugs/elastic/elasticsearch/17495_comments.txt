Thus, the [line](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7d4ed5b19ebc25d608d70babab0fb08f0c9ea122/distribution/src/main/resources/bin/elasticsearch-plugin#L70) you point to in the `elasticsearch-plugin` script is not the problem.\n\nThe problem here is the [use of `eval` when invoking `java`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7d4ed5b19ebc25d608d70babab0fb08f0c9ea122/distribution/src/main/resources/bin/elasticsearch-plugin#L113) using `JAVA`. While `$JAVA` is quoted there, evaluation of the parameters causes those quotes to be removed (this is normal shell behavior)! Note that the `elasticsearch` script [uses `exec` instead](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/distribution/src/main/resources/bin/elasticsearch#129), hence the difference.\n\nA simple solution is to use single quotes or escaped quotes around `\"$JAVA\"` (as other arguments here already do). Note that changing to use `exec` is a much bigger change because of the quoting of arguments that is done earlier in the script.\n\nI opened #17496.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/207387943","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17495#issuecomment-207387943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17495","id":207387943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzM4Nzk0Mw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-08T11:25:07Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T11:25:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closed by #17496.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
