In that case they work essentially the same way. The aggregation is actually even better since it has better heuristics to request more terms at the shard level which tends to improve accuracy. Also aggregations report on an error bound since 1.4.\n\nI'm wondering that the confusion might come from the fact that this limitation is documented for aggs for not faceets?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/96408443","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10769#issuecomment-96408443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10769","id":96408443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2NDA4NDQz","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-26T16:54:04Z","updated_at":"2015-04-26T16:54:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yep, this looks like a misunderstanding to me.
