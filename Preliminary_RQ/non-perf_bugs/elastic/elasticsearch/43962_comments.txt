The reason this is not working is because the â€œCopy Object\" method is used by the snapshot functionality in ES 5, which is incompatible with CMK (see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-managed-keys). This has been changed in ES versions >=6.4.0 (see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/31100). This might make CMK with default key work with newer ES versions (it's not tested and therefore not officially supported though).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/551019590","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43962#issuecomment-551019590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43962","id":551019590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTAxOTU5MA==","user":{"login":"chilang","id":7852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilang","html_url":"https://github.com/chilang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chilang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-07T10:29:27Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T10:29:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Upgraded to 6.8 and it's working now","performed_via_github_app":null}]
