It would enable someone to meaningfully combine multiple queries in a bool query, without a single clause overtaking the others. This would be a huge improvement over boosting the individual queries.\r\n\r\nI could see this being done via:\r\n\r\n1. A new query type,\r\n2. An addition to the [Function Score Query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-function-score-query.html)\r\n3. Access to the **mean** and **standard deviation** of a query in the \"script_score\" function of a function score query.\r\n\r\nI personally would prefer option 2, but recognize option 3 would allow individuals to design their own normalization functions to best suit their needs.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nI'm not the only one looking for this functionality. There is a StackOverflow discussion with 20+ votes on attempts (none successful) to achieve this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25361795/elasticsearch-how-to-normalize-score-when-combining-regular-query-and-function).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
