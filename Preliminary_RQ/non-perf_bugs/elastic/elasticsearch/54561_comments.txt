This is a problem with your react application (or some other part of your infrastructure). Maybe it's handling a slow response from ES improperly (that would be my best guess)?\r\n\r\nI'm closing here since we limit Github to feature requests and bug reports and this isn't an Elasticsearch issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
