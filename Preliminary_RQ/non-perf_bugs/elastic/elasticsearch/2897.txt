Nonetheless, I found something quite annoying: a comma is always prepend when adding a new raw field, whatever it is the first field or not. The JsonXContentGenerator.writeRawField methods [1] seems to confirm that.\n\nThis leads to malformed JSONs, for instance:\n\n``` java\n    @Test\n    public void rawFieldBug() throws IOException {\n        XContentBuilder factory = XContentFactory.jsonBuilder().startObject()\n                .rawField(\"myfield\", \"{}\".getBytes())\n                .endObject();\n        String json = factory.string();\n        Assert.assertEquals(\"{\\\"myfield\\\":{}}\", json);\n        // returns >{, \"myfield\" : {}}< instead\n    }\n```\n\nThis bug was seen in the 0.90.RC2 elasticsearch version.\n\nPS: In addition, a `rawField(String fieldName, String content)` (with potentially validation) might be very nice for such use cases :)\n\n[1] Extracted form `org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.json.JsonXContentGenerator`\n\n``` java\n    @Override\n    public void writeRawField(String fieldName, byte[] content, OutputStream bos) throws IOException {\n        generator.writeRaw(\", \\\"\"); // <= here?!\n        generator.writeRaw(fieldName);\n        generator.writeRaw(\"\\\" : \");\n        flush();\n        bos.write(content);\n    }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
