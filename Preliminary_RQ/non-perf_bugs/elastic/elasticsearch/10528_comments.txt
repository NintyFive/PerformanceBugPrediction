As in \"I only want one fragment per list entry but I want the top five fragments.\"  That wouldn't be inconceivable to implement using the [experimental highlighter](https://github.com/wikimedia/search-highlighter) but against the three built into Elasticsearch it'd be harder.  Partly it'd just be harder because you'd have to do it three times.  And partly harder because all but the plain highlighter don't load the field value in the order that you'd need it.\n\nUpshot: if you want it you'll have to implement it yourself.  If you implement it against the experimental highlighter I linked above I'll code review it.\n\nI figure its worth me saying this: I'm not part of the Elasticearch team. I just maintain the experimental highlighter. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
