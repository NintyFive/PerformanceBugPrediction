We can possibly shade it as well, since lucene changes enough between versions (like 3.5->3.6) that you can't really different versions with ES, but on the other hand it does increases the elasticsearch jar size.\n\nThe aim was not to require Lucene if you just use the TransportClient. The overhead of maintaining it as a different module is not worth it though, I prefer that we invest time in actually progressing elasticsearch than complicating the codebase just for that. This, as has been noted, has changed and because our compression module can now also compress Lucene input/output content, and it is also same compression abstraction used in the networking layer (its very similar, compressing lucene data and compression streams), Lucene is now needed when you use just the TransportClient.\n\nBtw, I have no problem with actually providing several jars of elasticsearch, one with lucene not shaded, and one with Lucene shaded. Not sure how to do it with maven though. I don't want to provide a version that does not shade netty/jackson for example, because of the deep intimiate usage elasticsearch has with them (for example, using the upcoming bufferring improvement with any previous version of netty except for the current one will actually use more memory compared to using considerably less).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/7159875","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2091#issuecomment-7159875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2091","id":7159875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNTk4NzU=","user":{"login":"jprante","id":635745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTc0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/635745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante","html_url":"https://github.com/jprante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jprante/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-07-22T09:17:42Z","updated_at":"2012-07-22T09:17:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree, the time is more valuable to move Elasticsearch forward instead of complicating the codebase.\n\nBecause this issue is not important enough I think I close the issue.\n\nJust one thought. The CompressorFactory and the Compressor interface is used from several other places in the ES codebase, but it is also dependent on external Lucene IndexInput and IndexOutput. This dependency could be delegated back to the places where CompressorFactory/Compressor is used. Wrapper classes like CompressedIndexInput and CompressedIndexOutput could look up dynamically what compression codecs are available so a factory is no longer needed in the Lucene parts of ES. A redesigned codec interface for compression could help to remove the dependencies from the CompressorFactory. The compressor codecs like bzip2, lzf, snappy could become even plugins.
