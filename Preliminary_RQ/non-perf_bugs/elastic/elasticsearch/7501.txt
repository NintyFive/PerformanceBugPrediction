(My client is configured with client.transport.ignore_cluster_name.)\n\nBut no warning prior to 1.3.1 regardless of whether cluster.name is specified.\nLikely coming from the TransportClient recognizing itself as a node (Martinex in the above example seems to be the transport client's node).  But that is unavoidable, so seems warning message is in-actionable and should not be printed.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
