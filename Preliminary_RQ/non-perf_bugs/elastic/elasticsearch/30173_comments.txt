I think this is something that Logstash was purpose built to do so you are probably better off doing it there. The reason this is difficult is that ingest is built to modify a single document and it'd be pretty complex to turn that into returning multiple documents. To properly implement this your request to index a single document would basically turn into a bulk. Internally, I think we could do it but it'd be a little tricky to get right. I think what is more tricky is what we'd return in the response. We'd want to tell the user about all the documents and that'd be a pretty huge change. But logstash is kind of built for this already....","performed_via_github_app":null}]
