I would have expected that a query_string query using minimum_should_match would respect the Boolean expression in the query like it does if you use default_operator OR/AND. If I for example have minimum_should_match=100% I would expect the same behavior as if I set default_operator=AND (the minimum_should_match i would like to be able to use would look more like \"3<80%\", but I get the same behavior there).\r\n\r\nIs this a bug, or is minimum_should_match not intended to work with Boolean expressions like this?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Create index/populate index:\r\n```\r\nPOST _bulk\r\n{\"index\":{\"_index\":\"index1\",\"_type\":\"type1\",\"_id\":\"1\"}}\r\n{\"field1\":\"aaa\"}\r\n{\"index\":{\"_index\":\"index1\",\"_type\":\"type1\",\"_id\":\"2\"}}\r\n{\"field1\":\"bbb\"}\r\n```\r\n 2. Query index using a query_string query with minimum_should_match, I get 0 hits\r\n```\r\nGET index1/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"query_string\": {\r\n      \"query\": \"(bbb OR aaa)\",\r\n      \"minimum_should_match\": \"100%\", \r\n      \"fields\": [\"field1\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 3. Query index using a query_string query with default_operator AND, I get 2 hits\r\n```\r\nGET index1/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"query_string\": {\r\n      \"query\": \"(bbb OR aaa)\",\r\n      \"default_operator\": \"AND\", \r\n      \"fields\": [\"field1\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
