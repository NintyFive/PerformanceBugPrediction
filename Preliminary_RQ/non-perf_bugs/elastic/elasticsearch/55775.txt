It defaults to \"true\" (which makes sense) and there really isn't much of a reason to ever set it to \"false\".\r\nThe savings in CPU when writing or reading files in the repo are probably irrelevant in practice in all cases and I don't see any other real reason why you wouldn't want to compress the metadata (it's barely human readable anyway since it's all SMILE).\r\n\r\nShould we just deprecate this setting in 7 and remove it and always compress in 8?
