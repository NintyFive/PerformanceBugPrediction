Use 'create' command to create one.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we default to using the Java `Console` class for CLI tooling, because it provides better support for things like reading passwords. However, it does not provide support for writing to stderr.\r\n\r\nI suspect we could build a hybrid `Terminal` that wrote primary output to the Console, but sent errors to `System.error`, however I have no idea if that would do The Right Thing:tm: on every supported platform.\r\n ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/502500530","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43260#issuecomment-502500530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43260","id":502500530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjUwMDUzMA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-17T00:47:33Z","updated_at":"2019-06-17T00:47:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra","performed_via_github_app":null}]
