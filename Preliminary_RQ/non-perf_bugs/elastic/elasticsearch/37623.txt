Running in Docker.\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system): 4.9.125-linuxkit\r\nDocker image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.5.4\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nI have an ElasticSearch node that is coming up in a docker-compose cluster locally.\r\nThis is the dockerfile:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.5.4\r\n\r\nADD elasticsearch.yml config/elasticsearch.yml\r\n```\r\nAnd this is the elasticsearch.yml:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncluster.name: \"docker-cluster\"\r\nnetwork.host: 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\n# minimum_master_nodes need to be explicitly set when bound on a public IP\r\n# set to 1 to allow single node clusters\r\n# Details: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/17288\r\ndiscovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 1\r\ndiscovery.type: single-node\r\nhttp.cors.enabled: true\r\nhttp.cors.allow-origin: \"*\"\r\n\r\n```\r\nI have verified that the configuration file is in the docker instance.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I provide an Origin header in a request to the node (from an origin that is not the node), it returns a 403 forbidden. When I provide an origin header with Origin: \"localhost:9200\", I get a normal response.\r\nWhen trying from a javascript client, I get\r\nAccess to XMLHttpRequest at '[http://localhost:9200/'](http://localhost:9200/%27) from origin 'http://localhost:8005' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.\r\n\r\nI can't find any documentation in ElasticSearch docs about something I should be doing differently. What am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1. Create a dockerfile based on an existing Elastic docker image. \r\n 2. Add an elasticsearch.yml with http.cors configurations enabled\r\n 3. Start the container, send a request with an origin other than \"localhost:9200\"\r\n4. Receive a 403 response\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\nNo relevant logs found in the elasticsearch output","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
