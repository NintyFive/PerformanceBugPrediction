Endpoints are `/_nodes/hot_threads`, and `/_nodes/{nodesIds}/hot_threads`.\n\nThe output is plain text with a breakdown of each node top hot threads. Parameters allows are: \n- `threads`: number of hot threads to provide, defaults to 3.\n- `interval`: the interval to do the second sampling of threads. Defaults to `500ms`.\n- `type`: The type to sample, defaults to `cpu`, but supports `wait` and `block` to see hot threads that are in wait or block state.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
