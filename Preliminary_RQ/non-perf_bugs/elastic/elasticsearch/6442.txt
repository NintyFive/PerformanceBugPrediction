One of the fields is a geopoint. Sometimes we don't have the lat/lon yet, so we were leaving the field null until we do have the data, then we update the document. \n\nI can understand that a location that is missing lat or missing lon would be invalid; this warrants an exception. But null or empty is not invalid, nor is it reason to throw an exception. \n\nSince, according to the Gist above there's is no longer a way to leave the geopoint null you are forcing me to write a custom JSON serializer to exclude the field when the geo data is not yet available. This is considerably more work/maintenance for myself and everyone else who encounters this. I don't see a good reason for this.\n\nI suggest that Elasticsearch should handle null and empty gracefully by ignoring/skipping the field instead of throwing an exception. Null and empty aren't invalid values. They simply mean there's no value for this field at this time.\n\n---\n\nUpdate: Later on after writing this I realized I can use `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)` to exclude null fields from my JSON. However, I still think my above points are valid. \n\nThanks, Matt\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
