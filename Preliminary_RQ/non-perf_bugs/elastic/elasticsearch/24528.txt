In order to do this, the plugins need to be on the JVM class path at compile time, but since there are no official Maven artifacts for the various Elasticsearch modules and plugins, such as `lang-painless`, people need to resort to third party artifacts (such as [`org.codelibs.elasticsearch.module:lang-painless`](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.codelibs.elasticsearch.module%7Clang-painless%7C5.4.0%7Cjar)).\r\n\r\nThis is basically a follow-up for https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elasticsearch-java-testing-framework-and-plugins/84703.","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
