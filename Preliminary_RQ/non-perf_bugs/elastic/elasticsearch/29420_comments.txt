Trying to guess upfront the types of mistakes people might make is a complex undertaking and finding a simple answer to that just creates problems. \r\nFor example, it is correct that users might make a typo between 'a' and 'A' if they create these indexes by hand. \r\nIt is also true that another group of users might not be owners of the Index name generation and might be using \"business significant\" IDs from other systems as Index names. These users will be forced to to do a toLower() while creating indexes via the API. Additionally they'll be forced to maintain a mapping between original and ES IDs.\r\nAnd I suspect the size of the second group of users will be larger compared to the first over time.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
