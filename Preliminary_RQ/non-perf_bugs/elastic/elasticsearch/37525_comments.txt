Thanks for pointing the Lucene [issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8637). \r\nRegarding the issue with the `_id` field, I think we should be able to filter queries that target this field when we highlight.  This field uses a special encoding that is not compatible with the re-analysis of the unified highlighter and there should be no use case where highlighting the `_id` is required. \r\nAs a workaround before the fix you can set `require_field_match` to true in the highlighter option. With this option activated, only the queries that target the highlighted field (`body`) are extracted from the main query.

My recommendation for the customer is to use an additional field for the document id.
