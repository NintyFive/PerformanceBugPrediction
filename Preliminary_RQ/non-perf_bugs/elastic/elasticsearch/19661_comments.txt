I've reached for it when writing reindex scripts and had to reimplement it and he's reached for it with search scripts. Given that painless is designed to make stuff convenient with Elasticsearch I figure we should just implement this. I don't think it should be called `replaceAll` though.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/239241314","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19661#issuecomment-239241314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19661","id":239241314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTI0MTMxNA==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T18:03:27Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T18:03:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't think we need to add \"helpers\" like this.
