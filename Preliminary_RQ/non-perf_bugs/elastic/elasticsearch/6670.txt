current documentation (http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-multi-get.html#docs-multi-get) indicates that type is optional in the _mget request.\n\nPer https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/6633, in the case of multiple types sharing the same ID, in order for _mget to fetch back documents sharing the same ID across types, a _type+_id parameter have to be specified (i.e. cannot simply specify _id to fetch documents across types sharing the same id).\n\n```\nGET /sameid/_mget/\n{\n  \"docs\" : [\n        {\n
