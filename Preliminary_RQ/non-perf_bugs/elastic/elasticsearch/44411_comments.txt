Date fields are now accessed through `.value`, and the type is now ZonedDateTime. Additionally for 7.0, we have switched to java time as our backend, which means the `.secondOfDay` access is deprecated (this was something specifically in joda). You will need to make sure your timestamp field is a date field, and not just a long field. Long term, you should use `doc['timestamp'].value.get(ChronoField.SECOND_OF_DAY)`. However, investigating this issue made me realize the get method is missing from our compatibility layer, so I opened #44829.\r\n\r\nGiven the issue here is use of `.date`, which was removed, I'm going to close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
