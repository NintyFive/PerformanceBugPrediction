The health status is driven by the state of the shards in the cluster.  E.g.\r\n\r\n- Green: all shards allocated\r\n- Yellow: all primaries allocated, one or more replicas missing\r\n- Red: One or more primaries missing\r\n\r\nYou can use the `level` flag to refine the status to see which index or shard is having problems.  And the [Cluster Allocation Explain](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-allocation-explain.html) will give more detailed information about why a particular shard is not allocating (no disk space, no free nodes based on filtering criteria, etc).\r\n\r\nIn the future, questions like this are best asked on the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) rather than Github.  We try to reserve this repo for bug reports.  Thanks! :)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/493072225","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42168#issuecomment-493072225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42168","id":493072225,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzA3MjIyNQ==","user":{"login":"remmeier","id":8008853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDg4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8008853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remmeier","html_url":"https://github.com/remmeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remmeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remmeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remmeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remmeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remmeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remmeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remmeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remmeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remmeier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T13:41:25Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T13:41:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"yes that has cleared up how it works. The purpose of the ticket would have been to make it slightly more obvious to newbies like just me. So maybe add a second field given the health status in english words. Maybe follow HATEOAS and link the other cluster allocation endpoint, ... HATEOAS  would in general be nice BTW to navigate the entire endpoint.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
