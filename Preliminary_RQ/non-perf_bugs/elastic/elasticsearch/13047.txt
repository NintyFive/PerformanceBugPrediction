It's used with time based indices. The disks are over 85% full, but they won't fill for a while so was planning on adding more storage next week. However when I restarted the node, it wouldn't serve any shards as the disk was over the 85% threshold, yet the shards were already on disk and all but the latest time based index was exactly the same as the primary elsewhere in the cluster.\n\nIt's not a major issue, just forced me to sort out my disk space situation before being able to restart any other nodes, and it might have been a pain to recover the data if the disk crashed on another node.\n\n```\n[node2] low disk watermark [85%] exceeded on [xxxxxx][node3] free: 50.2gb[12.4%], replicas will not be assigned to this node\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
