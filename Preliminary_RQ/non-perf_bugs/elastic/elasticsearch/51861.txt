S3 compatible blob stores force v4 authentication with regions other than the default `us-east-1` or don't support v4 authentication.\r\nCurrently there is no way of changing the signing region (we only allow setting the endpoint) or forcing the S3 SDK to not use v4 auth if the endpoint does not support it.\r\n\r\nWe should bring back the region setting to allow v4 auth to properly work if the blobstore supports it.\r\nAlso, we should expose the [signer override setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html#setSignerOverride-java.lang.String-) to allow forcing the supported auth mechanism in case the SDK is unable to determine the correct one for a given endpoint. \r\n\r\nLink:
