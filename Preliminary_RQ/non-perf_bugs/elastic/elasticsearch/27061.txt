Snapshots are taken hourly into a repository, and every month a new repository is used for snapshots.\r\n\r\nWe found a repository could have been corrupted in that every time a snapshot is being taken, the snapshot process always fail with two errors trying to delete two missing files during cleanup:\r\n\r\nIndexShardSnapshotFailedException[error deleting index file [index-232] during cleanup]; nested: NoSuchFileException[Failed to delete 'indices/g0UOKeKXSCSL3rbNvfjq4Q/0/index-232\r\n\r\nIndexShardSnapshotFailedException[error deleting index file [pending-index-427] during cleanup]; nested: NoSuchFileException[Failed to delete 'indices/g0UOKeKXSCSL3rbNvfjq4Q/1/pending-index-427\r\n\r\nThe custom repository plugin does throw NoSuchFileException in BlobContainer.deleteBlob(String blobName)  if the blob does not exist. This NoSuchFileException stop the snapshot process and fail in cleanup. If we modify the repository plugin to not throwing NoSuchFileException in BlobContainer.deleteBlob(String blobName) but log a warning, then the snapshot does proceed to success (on every shards) and the snapshot can also restore the index.\r\n\r\nAfter making this walkaround of not throwing NoSuchFileException in BlobContainer.deleteBlob(String blobName), the warning of NoSuchFile from deleteBlob still show up everytime taking a snapshot in that repository. We suspect there the file names could be referenced in some metadata and the metadata is not cleanup correctly.\r\n\r\nWe have also tried to delete the snapshots starting these errors, the snapshots are deleted with same errors(warnings), but it does not 'fix' the repository as taking a snapshot in this repository still produce the same errors of deleting the same missing files.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1.\r\n 2.\r\n 3.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
