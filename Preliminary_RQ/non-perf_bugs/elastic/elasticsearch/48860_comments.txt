I think your question is better suited for our forums at https://discuss.elastic.co/. \r\n\r\nSome general feedback, but please let's take this to the forums if it needs more discussion. Have you tried using the explain API to try and see how the query changes internally in the two described scenarios? There are subtleties when it comes to searching for multiple terms against multiple fields. Where is the operator applied? Do all terms need to appear in all fields? For things like this, match query allows you to configure its behaviour and is generally better than query_string.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/549825330","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48860#issuecomment-549825330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48860","id":549825330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTgyNTMzMA==","user":{"login":"Flinou","id":1483500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODM1MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1483500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flinou","html_url":"https://github.com/Flinou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flinou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flinou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flinou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flinou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flinou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flinou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flinou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flinou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flinou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-05T13:36:45Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T13:36:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I did post on discuss.elastic : [Link](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/default-operator-and-with-query-string-does-not-work-properly/203667).
