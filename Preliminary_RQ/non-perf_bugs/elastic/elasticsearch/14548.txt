Some environments may prefer to not block on such failures and continue to index the failed document anyways. For these scenarios it would be nice to have an `continue_on_failure` flag turned on to instruct Elasticsearch to index the document as it was before it was processed by the ingest pipeline. Such documents can be tagged so that they can be found in the index for re-processing.\n\n`_simulate` should also support this flag to help with recreating pipeline behavior\n\ndepends on https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/14888\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
