This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that should be able to help get an answer to your question.\r\nAs such, I hope you don't mind that I close this. If it turns out that there is a real bug, then we can re-open this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/464624785","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39028#issuecomment-464624785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39028","id":464624785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDYyNDc4NQ==","user":{"login":"liuhamglin","id":18131476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTMxNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18131476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin","html_url":"https://github.com/liuhamglin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-18T07:58:28Z","updated_at":"2019-02-18T07:58:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto\r\n\r\nUnexpected response code [404] from calling GET http://127.0.0.1:9200/_xpack/security/_authenticate?pretty\r\nIt doesn't look like the X-Pack security feature is enabled on this Elasticsearch node.\r\nPlease check if you have enabled X-Pack security in your elasticsearch.yml configuration file.\r\n\r\nERROR: X-Pack Security is disabled by configuration.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/464626555","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39028#issuecomment-464626555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39028","id":464626555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDYyNjU1NQ==","user":{"login":"liuhamglin","id":18131476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTMxNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18131476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin","html_url":"https://github.com/liuhamglin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuhamglin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-18T08:04:38Z","updated_at":"2019-02-18T08:04:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![7tch5m b 9o1qlhu hi_wa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18131476/52936264-989c4580-3396-11e9-8d4c-71eca560469f.png)\r\nI've configured xpack security to be enabled in the configuration file, but I don't see it in kibana","performed_via_github_app":null}]
