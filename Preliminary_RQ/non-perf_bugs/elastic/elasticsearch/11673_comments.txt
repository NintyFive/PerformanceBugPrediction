Are you sure your cluster is properly firewalled?  What about putting a proxy in front of it and logging requests?\n\nWe've actually removed the shutdown API in #10831, but if your cluster is open to abusive requests, you'll have other problems as well, even without this API.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/112979174","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11673#issuecomment-112979174","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11673","id":112979174,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjk3OTE3NA==","user":{"login":"rhycce","id":4632924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzI5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4632924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhycce","html_url":"https://github.com/rhycce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhycce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhycce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhycce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhycce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhycce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhycce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhycce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhycce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhycce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-17T23:27:22Z","updated_at":"2015-06-17T23:27:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That is what I suspected. The cluster  has all the security policies in place and even has its own security group with limited access on Amazon. Also the techOps guys confirmed that access to the master node was limited to IP's coming from our office. We even dumped all tcp requests on that port to see if there were any incoming requests during the failure but it seemed there was none. Since we couldn't resolve the issue, we shut it down, zipped up the master node, moved it to a new instance and restarted it. So far it has been working without any issues. This might be caused by a corrupted EC2 instance. Unfortunately, since the new instance is working, techOps had to shutdown the possibly corrupted instance so I could not debug further.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
