The node that i had created (e.g. non data and non master) - what is the distinction between that and a client node?\n\nIf i look at the latest elasticsearch.yml on master, i see:\n\n```\n# You can exploit these settings to design advanced cluster topologies.\n#\n# 1. You want this node to never become a master node, only to hold data.\n#    This will be the \"workhorse\" of your cluster.\n#\n#node.master: false\n#node.data: true\n#\n# 2. You want this node to only serve as a master: to not store any data and\n#    to have free resources. This will be the \"coordinator\" of your cluster.\n#\n#node.master: true\n#node.data: false\n#\n# 3. You want this node to be neither master nor data node, but\n#    to act as a \"search load balancer\" (fetching data from nodes,\n#    aggregating results, etc.)\n#\n#node.master: false\n#node.data: false\n```\n\nbut i don't see node.client mentioned as a setting. I'm just trying to understand the difference from a setting/configuration point of view...\n\nAlso: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-node.html mentions that a client is node.master: false and node.data: false\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/55384357","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7696#issuecomment-55384357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7696","id":55384357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Mzg0MzU3","user":{"login":"derryos","id":1150305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTAzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1150305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derryos","html_url":"https://github.com/derryos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derryos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derryos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derryos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derryos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derryos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derryos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derryos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derryos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derryos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-12T10:14:54Z","updated_at":"2014-09-12T10:14:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"After checking the code and discussing with people on IRC, it was pointed out that the main difference between client: true and node.master: false, node.data: false is the inability to use rivers - otherwise, it's only used in testing/stats:\nhttps://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=.clientNode%28%29\n\nAlso, it seems that the logic i was suggesting is checked in some places:\nhttps://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/a50934ea3edb9bf42b3eb1f47db53fc088e9cb7d/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/discovery/zen/ZenDiscovery.java#L951\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/56712995","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7696#issuecomment-56712995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7696","id":56712995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzEyOTk1","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-24T18:05:05Z","updated_at":"2014-09-24T18:05:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, we may simplify this in the future.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
