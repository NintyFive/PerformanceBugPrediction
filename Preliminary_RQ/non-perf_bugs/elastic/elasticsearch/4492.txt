requesting `fields` in the search, get, update, etc APIs, we should be able to control where those values come from with these prefixes:\n- `_source`: extract the field value from the `_source` field\n- `_fields`: retrieve a `stored` field value\n- `_doc`: retrieve the value from fielddata\n\nThe `_doc` option is particularly useful for retrieving dates as, no matter the format they're specified in in the source, they will be accessible as milliseconds-since-the-epoch from fielddata, without the need to allow dynamic scripts.\n\nWhile on the subject, perhaps we should support this same syntax in scripting, instead of `docs['foo']`?\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
