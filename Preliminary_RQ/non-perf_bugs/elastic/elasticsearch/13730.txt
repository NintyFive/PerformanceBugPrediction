Alas, the result of `doc().types` (method of `AbstractSearchScript`) only contains the type of the top level hit, and calls like `docFieldLongs(\"child_attr\")` result in errors of the form _No field found for [child_attr] in mapping with types [parent_type]_.\n\nCreating a full working example is a bit involved as it includes a server-side plugin with a native script, but the search request from the client looks like this:\n\n``` java\nnew SearchRequestBuilder(client)\n    .setSearchType(SearchType.QUERY_THEN_FETCH)\n    .setIndices(\"an-index\")\n    .setTypes(\"parent_type\")\n    .addInnerHit(\"child\", new InnerHit()\n        .setType(\"child\")\n        .addScriptField(\"scripted\", \"native\", \"my_script\");\n```\n\n(In reality, there's a sort and size and from here and there)\n\nThe following then triggers the error for me:\n\n``` java\n@Override\npublic Object run() {\n    return docFieldLongs(\"child_attr\").getValue();\n}\n```\n\nIs the result of `doc()` (what `docFieldLongs()` uses) as intended here or should that refer to the doc of type `child` that was matched as an inner hit?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
