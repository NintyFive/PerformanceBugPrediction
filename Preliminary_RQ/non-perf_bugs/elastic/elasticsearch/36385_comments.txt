Kibana uses another API called `field_caps` to retrieve field mapping, this API can handle cross cluster so you can use remote indices in your index patterns. SQL doesn't handle cross cluster yet but this is planned so we' should add the support soon. I don't know the plan for Canvas so you should probably open an issue in the Kibana repo to get some informations. Grafana is a separate project so I have no idea if and how it should support cross cluster search. I hope you don't mind if I close this issue, there is no bug or feature to add in Elasticsearch here. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
