I think we should avoid using `// KIBANA` for any calls against the Elasticsearch APIs (e.g. https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/39583/files#diff-5fa81aa90baa4f03546357926caee588R80). I think the intention is that we only want to show the cURL form of the API call in these security instances because the user will not yet have access to Console and labelling these as `// KIBANA` is quite confusing IMO as it mixes \"only show cURL\" with \"this is something relevant to Kibana\". It is likely to cause confusion to people looking at the raw asciidoc and it prevents 2 below.\r\n2. We need to be able to differentiate between Kibana API calls and Elasticsearch API calls. The docs snippet testing cannot currently be used against Kibana APIs because the tests only set up an Elasticsearch cluster and makes calls against that. So we need to be able to  differentiate between things that need to be tested against Elasticsearch APIs in the Elasticsearch build and things that need to be tested against the Kibana APIs (we need to determine where these ones should be tested and how)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/469284485","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39594#issuecomment-469284485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39594","id":469284485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTI4NDQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-04T15:03:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T15:03:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think using `// KIBANA` is a quick and dirty fix that might be appropriate temporarily. It renders how we want it to render if though it does it for the wrong reasons. That isn't great but I can live with it in the short run if we have to.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'd prefer Kibana fix the DELETE APIs soon. I know HTTP doesn't particularly like DELETE-with-a-body, but Elasticsearch has them and Kibana *is* Elasticsearch's dev console so it should support them. Or Elasticsearch should stop using them. I'd prefer that, actually, but I don't image it'll happen. Either way, I don't think we should build an entirely new concept in the docs because of a bug in Kibana.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/469287263","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39594#issuecomment-469287263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39594","id":469287263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTI4NzI2Mw==","user":{"login":"bmcconaghy","id":2479496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Nzk0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2479496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmcconaghy","html_url":"https://github.com/bmcconaghy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmcconaghy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmcconaghy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmcconaghy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmcconaghy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmcconaghy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmcconaghy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmcconaghy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmcconaghy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmcconaghy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-04T15:10:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T15:10:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think we should call the option `CURL_ONLY`, then the semantics are clear and we're not using the `KIBANA` option on ES APIs.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/539077110","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39594#issuecomment-539077110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39594","id":539077110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTA3NzExMA==","user":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-07T15:45:28Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T15:45:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded by https://github.com/elastic/docs/issues/1238","performed_via_github_app":null}]
