You can search for `wandring~1` but not `wandring*~1`. If you want to mix prefix search and fuzziness you can use the `completion` field in a `suggest` query or use an analyzer that builds all prefix/suffix of the terms at index time (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-ngram-tokenizer.html) so that you can query an exact term (with fuzziness if needed) and get all suffixes/prefixes at query time.
