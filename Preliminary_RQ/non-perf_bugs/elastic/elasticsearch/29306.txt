Some of these use cases, for example adding a log4j appender, may need additional SecurityManager permissions. Instead of relying on the system security policy to add these grants, this issue is to propose a new type of \"bootstrap\" plugin.\r\n\r\nA bootstrap plugin would be packaged similarly to a normal plugin, in that it would contain jars, an optional security policy, and a plugin descriptor, but how the plugin is loaded would be completely different. We would collect all the jars of these plugins within bin/elasticsearch and add them to the classpath. Then the policy files would be read at startup and granted to the jars of the relevant plugin. \r\n\r\nThis could be a nice way to package something like log4j json logger and make it easily installable for users without having to include it with the normal distribution.\r\n\r\nNote this would be an alternative implementation to satisfy the needs in #29176.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
