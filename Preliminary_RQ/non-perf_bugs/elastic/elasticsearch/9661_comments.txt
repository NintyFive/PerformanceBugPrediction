This will disable recovery and allow you to bring down a node change the any static ES setting or system properties. After you brought up the node you can enable automatic allocation (setting `cluster.routing.allocation.enable` to `all` via cluster update api). If you decide to remove that permanently then you just enable automatic shard allocation.\n\nIf you shutdown a node gracefully it will send a leave request to the elected master, which removes the node from the cluster and let all other nodes know about it. \n\nSo I don't see a need to add an specific api to remove nodes from a cluster.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
