I should have realized. It says it can't create `com/carrotsearch/ant/tasks/junit4/SuiteBalancer which makes sense because that isn't part of Elasticseach's built - it is a dependency _of_ Elasticsearch's build. And including the project dependency gets you our build's dependencies. But including the file dependency doesn't. So, yeah, file isn't going to work unless you resolve the dependencies yourself. [This](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/buildSrc/build.gradle#L86) is the current list of the build dependencies.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
