If we want to change `xxxQuery` to `xxx`, then we also need to think about filters which all end with `Filter` like `andFilter`.\n\nFor code readability, I think it's better to keep the appended `Query` and `Filter` words in method names.\n\nBecause we could end up to write something like:\n\n``` java\nfilteredQuery(\n    termQuery(\"foo\", \"bar\"),\n    termFilter(\"foo\", \"bar\"))\n```\n\nwhich would become something similar to (depending on imports basically)\n\n``` java\nfilteredQuery(\n    term(\"foo\", \"bar\"),\n    FilterBuilders.term(\"foo\", \"bar\"))\n```\n\nThe later is less readable IMHO.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
