was trying to play with the suggest feature and get a headache when my first basic example was working but my complexe one wasn't giving results at all. \nI just figured out that when you have a source field at the higher level of your mapping/document, the suggest feature doesn't return anything. \n\nHere is my mapping which the suggest feature doesn't work : \n\n```\n{\n  \"source\" : {\n    \"properties\" : {\n      \"domain\" : {\n        \"type\" : \"completion\",\n        \"analyzer\" : \"autocomplete\",\n        \"payloads\" : true,\n        \"preserve_separators\" : false,\n        \"preserve_position_increments\" : false,\n        \"max_input_len\" : 50\n      },\n      \"forum\" : {\n        \"type\" : \"completion\",\n        \"analyzer\" : \"autocomplete\",\n        \"payloads\" : true,\n        \"preserve_separators\" : false,\n        \"preserve_position_increments\" : false,\n        \"max_input_len\" : 50\n      },\n      \"source\" : {\n        \"properties\" : {\n          \"name\" : {\n            \"type\" : \"completion\",\n            \"analyzer\" : \"autocomplete\",\n            \"payloads\" : true,\n            \"preserve_separators\" : false,\n            \"preserve_position_increments\" : false,\n            \"max_input_len\" : 50\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere is my new working one. I just replaced source by toto. \n\n```\n{\n  \"source\" : {\n    \"properties\" : {\n      \"domain\" : {\n        \"type\" : \"completion\",\n        \"analyzer\" : \"autocomplete\",\n        \"payloads\" : true,\n        \"preserve_separators\" : false,\n        \"preserve_position_increments\" : false,\n        \"max_input_len\" : 50\n      },\n      \"forum\" : {\n        \"type\" : \"completion\",\n        \"analyzer\" : \"autocomplete\",\n        \"payloads\" : true,\n        \"preserve_separators\" : false,\n        \"preserve_position_increments\" : false,\n        \"max_input_len\" : 50\n      },\n      \"toto\" : {\n        \"properties\" : {\n          \"name\" : {\n            \"type\" : \"completion\",\n            \"analyzer\" : \"autocomplete\",\n            \"payloads\" : true,\n            \"preserve_separators\" : false,\n            \"preserve_position_increments\" : false,\n            \"max_input_len\" : 50\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
