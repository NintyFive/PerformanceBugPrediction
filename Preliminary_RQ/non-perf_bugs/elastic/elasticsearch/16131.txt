So I think 8832 only addresses part of this request here.  The other part is that it will be helpful to report on the size on disk usage (eg. ls -l) of the Lucene files, in particular, the ones that tend to use the most storage like files associated to term dictionaries, norms, doc values.  The use case is that one can use this information to help size the amount of OS cache space (probably not 1-1 since its unlikely that it will use all of the norms, doc values, terms, etc.. but it will be helpful to get an idea of the worst case scenario when it comes to sizing).   Since this may end up being a separate API, I am filing this as a new ticket.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
