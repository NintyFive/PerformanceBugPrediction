This leaves us in a position of being unable to detect even some issues that **ought** to be statically detectable (i.e. not related to reqest/response or API changes).  See https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/36190 for an example of this.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we should enable the Deprecation Info API (or add a new API) to read the deprecation logs to allow us to surface issues that aren't detectable via the current implementation, including both issues like the above and usage of deprecated APIs or request formats that will require application changes.","closed_by":{"login":"gwbrown","id":1522844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjI4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1522844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/gwbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
