The `path` allows for dot notation to access inner objects and fields. For example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"comment\" : {\n        \"_routing\" : {\n            \"required\" : true,\n            \"path\" : \"blog.post_id\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above will route the following document using the value \"111222\" :\n\n```\n{\n    \"text\" : \"the comment text\"\n    \"blog\" : {\n        \"id\" : \"111222\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nA note, when using `_path` and not providing the `_routing` specifically in the API, there might be an additional parsing stage to extract the routing before directing the operation to the relevant shard.\n\nAlso, there is a validation stage as well if the routing is provided as part of the API and a path is specified.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
