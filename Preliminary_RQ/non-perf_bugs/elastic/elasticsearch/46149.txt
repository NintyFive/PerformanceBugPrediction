Some examples: #43916, #43837, #43775, #43851, #35813. \r\n\r\nWe would like to fix these issues but at the same realize that fixing these bugs and inconsistencies might affect the users that are currently accidentally rely on them. Since most of these issues can be classified as bugs, we would like roll out the change that will fix these issues in one of 7.x releases instead of waiting for 8.0. However, we don't have a mechanism to notify users about breaking changes in minor releases. Moreover the current upgrade checker might not be the best suited for this particular use case since in order to check for the presence of records affected by these changes will will have to scan all records. \r\n\r\nIn the team discussion of this issue we came to the conclusion that we need to introduce a stand alone utility that can be executed by users in order to detect the records affected by the change. We would like to extend this discussion to a broader group to see if other options or solutions available. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
