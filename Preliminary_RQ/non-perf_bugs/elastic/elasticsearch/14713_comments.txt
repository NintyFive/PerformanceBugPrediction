A few points to help answer your question:\n- ES doesn't currently use the spatial3d package as its performance and API is not yet ready for integration.\n- Lucene spatial now supports `CONTAINS` and it is extremely low hanging fruit to add. So I'll actually open a PR shortly to add this functionality to 2.2+. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
