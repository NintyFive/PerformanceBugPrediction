If I want to have a facet to further filter my search it would be fine, but what if I want to compare? like I want 2 facets, one for the current search and one global on all tags, so that I can say that there is 6/32, could you please help or redirect me? I tried docs and forumes and I can't find what's wrong.\n\nThanks fo ES, it's great!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/3151430","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50#issuecomment-3151430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50","id":3151430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTE0MzA=","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-12-14T21:59:50Z","updated_at":"2011-12-14T21:59:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@allochi move the global another level up (under the facet name)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/3153180","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50#issuecomment-3153180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50","id":3153180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTMxODA=","user":{"login":"allochi","id":126279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjI3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/126279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allochi","html_url":"https://github.com/allochi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allochi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allochi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allochi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allochi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allochi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allochi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allochi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allochi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allochi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-12-14T22:40:51Z","updated_at":"2011-12-14T22:41:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a million!!!
