The difference between that API and the request in this issue is that I'd like to be able to test out a single index template and see how its config (including its component templates) gets resolved. I think the linked simulate API could address this by making the `index_name` param optional, so you could just omit it and only get back the resolved config for the provided body. \r\n\r\nPer @dakrone a work-around from the UI side would be to simulate with an index name (e.g. some hash) and change the template to have an index pattern with the same hash so that it will be the only template to match the index name.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/624795111","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56255#issuecomment-624795111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56255","id":624795111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDc5NTExMQ==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T17:49:41Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T17:49:41Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-features (:Core/Features/Indices APIs)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/626023404","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56255#issuecomment-626023404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56255","id":626023404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjAyMzQwNA==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T21:14:00Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T21:14:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Relates to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56390","performed_via_github_app":null}]
