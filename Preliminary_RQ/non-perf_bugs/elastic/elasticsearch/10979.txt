There are actions that spawn other requests and we make sure that the context/headers of the original request is passed along to the sub-requests.\n\nIn the case of a search request, we have some cases where this context/headers passing doesn't happen and we need to fix that (we need to make sure the context & headers are not lost at any point in the execution). The reason for this today is that some spawned request simply don't have access to the original request. For example, `TermsLookup` used by the external terms filter executes a search during the parsing of the query. It has no access to the original search request that was executed and therefore cannot pass along the context & headers.\n\nTo solve that we can use the `SearchContext` and let it hold the search request context & headers (maybe we can have the `SearchContext` extends `ContextHolder`). During the execution of a search, any phase that is part of the execution has access to the search context using the thread local based `SearchContext.current()`. We need to make sure, to set the request context & headers on the `SearchContext` when it is created. From there on, we can extract these request context & headers everywhere we need to and pass it to the sub-request (a la `TermsLookup`).\n\nOther sub request we need to look at:\n- `MoreLikeThisQuery`\n- `GeoShapeFilter` and `GeoShapeQuery` with a indexed shape\n- Indexed Scripts\n- Phrase Suggester with a collate query or filter\n- Search Templates with indexed templates\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
