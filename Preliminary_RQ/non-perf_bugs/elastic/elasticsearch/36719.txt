The issues is that the whole watch run with all results is written to `.watcher-history-*` as one document. This results in very big documents (`result.input.payload` and `result.transform.payload`). The practical issue with this is that the watch history list in Kibana (Management -> Elasticsearch -> Watcher -> Watches -> log_issues) is unable to show more than one watch execution.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if some \"filter_path\"/\"exclude_filter_path\" could be specified in the watch definition which should end up in `.watcher-history-*`.","closed_by":{"login":"albertzaharovits","id":4568420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njg0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4568420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits","html_url":"https://github.com/albertzaharovits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
