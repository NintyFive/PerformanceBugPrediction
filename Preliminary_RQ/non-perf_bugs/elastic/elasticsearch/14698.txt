It would be great to only show what has been modified from after the previous processor's mutations.\n\nSomething like this would be nice:\n\n```\n{\n      \"error\": false,\n      \"processor_results\": [\n        {\n          \"processor_id\": \"processor[mutate]-0\",\n          \"error\": false,\n          \"modified\": true,\n          \"doc_diff\": {\n            \"updated\": {\n              \"_source.foo\": 5\n            },\n            \"added\": {},\n            \"removed\": {}\n          }\n        },\n        ...\n      ]\n    }\n```\n\ndepends on: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/14572\n","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
