A query looks like:\n\n```\n{\n    \"or\": [    \n   {\n        \"has_child\": {\n            \"type\": \"C\",\n           \"query\": {\n               A query named q1\n           },\n           \"name\": \"xxx\"\n       },\n       {\n           \"has_child\": {\n               \"type\": \"C\",\n               \"query\": {\n                  A query named q2\n               },\n              \"name\":  \"yyy\"\n           }\n       }\n}\n```\n\nSearching for doc_type P.\n\n**It's possible for a single document C that satisfies both q1 and q2.**\n\nSo, I wanna parse the es result to figure out which query is hitted by the matched query, what am I doing is:\n- Find the inner object by xxx or yyy\n- Find the matched query in the inner hits\n\nWhat I expected is finding q1 in xxx or q2 in yyy, but actually I found both q1 and q2 in xxx (Actually q1 and q2 may be the same query except the name), but the named query q2 isn't defined in has_child query xxx.\n\n==== More ====\n\nThe version of elasticsearch is 2.0.0 Release.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
