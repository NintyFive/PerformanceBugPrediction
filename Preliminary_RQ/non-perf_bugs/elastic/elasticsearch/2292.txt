Therefore, LGPL v2.1-licensed works must not be included in Apache products, although they may be listed as system requirements or distributed elsewhere as optional works.\"_\n\nAt least the different license should be mentioned in the Notice.txt to be clear.\n\nI also read that Rob Eden (maintainer+author of trove) cannot change the license - [see here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-121?focusedCommentId=12895284&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-12895284)\n\nShould the mahout collections used instead?\n\nThe same applies to [JTS](http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/jtshome.htm) and [JNA](https://github.com/twall/jna/blob/master/LICENSE)\n","closed_by":{"login":"karussell","id":129644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/129644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell","html_url":"https://github.com/karussell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karussell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
