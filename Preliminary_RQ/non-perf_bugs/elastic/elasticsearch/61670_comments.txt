It looks like we throw this error if the S3 SDK completely fails to execute the API request (doesn't even attempt it for some reason) and thus we unexpectedly see this exception.\r\nI looked through a lot of logs on our end and could not find a single instance of this failure. I can and will fix this code to not throw a null pointer exception but I think there is a deeper reason for why this is failing on your end. \r\n\r\nMaybe look into the logs to see if there's any failures logged from the S3 SDK before getting to this line?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
