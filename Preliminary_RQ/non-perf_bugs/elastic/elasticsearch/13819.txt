And users generally should force merge only when the index is otherwise idle ... 5.0 has been out for a while now and I haven't heard user complaints about this.\n\nCMS has a setting to change the default MB/sec for forced merges, but we haven't exposed it in ES, and this is a behavior change from before (in ES 1.x) when all merges IO (natural and forced) were held to the shared default of 20 MB/sec.\n\nNote that users can still set the old IO store throttling (`indices/index.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec`) and it will still apply to all merges.\n\nSo we could do nothing here, and if that turns out to be a problem, users can still use the old way (but we need to re-document this if so).\n\nOr we can open up a MB/sec setting for forced merges ... I don't really like that: ES has too many settings, and \"MB/sec\" is too raw/low-level for a user who's kicking off a forced merge to necessarily know the right value for.\n\nOr we could hardwire the force merge MB/sec to be a function of the current natural merge MB/sec auto IO throttle, maybe just `==`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikemccand","id":796508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/796508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemccand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
