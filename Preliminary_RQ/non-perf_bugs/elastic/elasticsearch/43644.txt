tldr\r\nThis meta issue captures all tasks needed to support a new `shape` field type (in a new `spatial` x-pack module) for providing search capabilities of arbitrary 2D cartesian geometry (points, lines, polygons, and their multi variants). It has a lot in common with geospatial applications; including the ability to support `INTERSECTS`, `WITHIN`, `DISJOINT`, and (eventually) `CONTAINS`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nWith the addition of BKD geo shapes and its ability to decompose geometries into triangular tessellations, all the pieces are in place for creating a new field that lifts the -180, 180 longitude, -90, 90 latitude restriction and adds support for indexing cartesian (non lat, lon ellipsoidal) geometries. Elasticsearch could benefit from a `shape` field (as a companion to `geo_shape`) that addresses the general X, Y geometry use case (users currently hijack `geo_point` or `geo_shape` for this). `shape` field use cases include:\r\n* CAD diagrams\r\n* Sports venues\r\n* Warehouse mapping\r\n* General Venue mapping\r\n* Gaming & Virtual Maps\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\n\r\n1. `shape` is a general 2D cartesian coordinate system (3D can be added in future)\r\n2. Coordinate system bounds include `-Float.MAX_VALUE` : `+Float.Max_Value`\r\n3. Any custom datum, referencing, or projections are handled outside the field\r\n4. Licensed: Basic\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x]  Update ShapeBuilders to support non Geospatial coordinate system\r\n- [x]  Update ShapeBuilders to build Lucene's new `XY{Geometry}`; currently they only build `LatLon{Geometry}`\r\n- [x]  Update GeoJson and WKT parsing to support non Geo Coordinates\r\n- [x]  Add new `ShapeFieldMapper` built on top of Lucene's [XYShape field](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/726)\r\n- [x] Add new `ShapeQueryBuilder` to build XYShape lucene queries\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
