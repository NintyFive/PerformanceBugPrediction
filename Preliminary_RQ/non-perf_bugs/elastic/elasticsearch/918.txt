Words are split into subwords with the following rules:\n- split on intra-word delimiters (by default, all non alpha-numeric characters).\n- \"Wi-Fi\" -> \"Wi\", \"Fi\"\n- split on case transitions: \"PowerShot\" -> \"Power\", \"Shot\"\n- split on letter-number transitions: \"SD500\" -> \"SD\", \"500\"\n- leading and trailing intra-word delimiters on each subword are ignored: \"//hello---there, 'dude'\" -> \"hello\", \"there\", \"dude\"\n- trailing \"'s\" are removed for each subword: \"O'Neil's\" -> \"O\", \"Neil\"\n\nParameters include:\n- `generate_word_parts`: If `true` causes parts of words to be generated: \"PowerShot\" => \"Power\" \"Shot\". Defaults to `true`.\n- `generate_number_parts`: If `true` causes number subwords to be generated: \"500-42\" => \"500\" \"42\". Defaults to `true`.\n- `catenate_words`: If `true` causes maximum runs of word parts to be catenated: \"wi-fi\" => \"wifi\". Defaults to `false`.\n- `catenate_numbers`: If `true` causes maximum runs of number parts to be catenated: \"500-42\" => \"50042\". Defaults to `false`.\n- `catenate_all`: If `true` causes all subword parts to be catenated: \"wi-fi-4000\" => \"wifi4000\". Defaults to `false`.\n- `split_on_case_change`: If `true` causes \"PowerShot\" to be two tokens; (\"Power-Shot\" remains two parts regards). Defaults to `true`.\n- `preserve_original`: If `true` includes original words in subwords: \"500-42\" => \"500\" \"42\" \"500-42\". Defaults to `false`.\n- `split_on_numerics`: If `true` causes \"j2se\" to be three tokens; \"j\" \"2\" \"se\". Defaults to `true`.\n- `stem_english_possessive`: If `true` causes trailing \"'s\" to be removed for each subword: \"O'Neil's\" => \"O\", \"Neil\". Defaults to `true`.\n\nAdvance settings include:\n\n`protected_words`: A list of protected words from being delimiter. Either an array, or also can set `protected_words_path` which resolved to a file configured with protected words (one on each line). Automatically resolves to `config/` based location if exists.\n\n`type_table`: A custom type mapping table, for example (when configured using `type_table_path`):\n\n```\n# Map the $, %, '.', and ',' characters to DIGIT \n# This might be useful for financial data.\n$ => DIGIT\n% => DIGIT\n. => DIGIT\n\\u002C => DIGIT\n\n# in some cases you might not want to split on ZWJ\n# this also tests the case where we need a bigger byte[]\n# see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner\n\\u200D => ALPHANUM\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
