Nothing much to worry about if you had nodes under load (and you are indeed using multicast). It can also happen if you have restarted a node in the middle of pinging and it's very quick to come back. The node will receive answers to ping it's predecessor sent but of course, the id is no longer in memory.\n\nLet me know if this explains things so we can close it (or not..).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/60819177","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8256#issuecomment-60819177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8256","id":60819177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwODE5MTc3","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-28T19:46:54Z","updated_at":"2014-10-28T19:46:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bleskes thanks.
