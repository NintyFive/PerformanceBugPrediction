It is needed to support unbounded ranges, which otherwise forces histogram to keep creating new buckets until the end of time since the range is unbounded.  Users can now specify the absolute max extents of their histogram and we won't create any further buckets. This feature was added to 7.10.0 and not currently documented.","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
