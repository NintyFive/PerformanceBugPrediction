checking the init scripts there are allot of differences between them.\nThis is the result after an initial scan of the files.\n\nRPM doesn't have:\n- id = root check ( validation of the user trying to start is the root user )\n- default values ( currently sysconfig file is leading while default values should be in init script and sysconfig file should override those )\n- Debian script has a nice DAEMON and DAEMON_OPTS variables to keep things clean and simple.\n- Check for different JDK directories to use.\n- -Des.default.config=$CONF_FILE option when launching ES.\n- Uses lower and upper case variable names ( nicer to use upper case everywhere. )\n\nDEB doesn't have:\n- Daemon check ( does the program exist )\n- Does the config file exist?\n- mkdir/chown for general directories\n- if MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY is set, make sure that ES_HEAP_SIZE  is set as well.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
