At query time however we thin out the ngrams used in queries e.g. we'd drop the middle `234` in order to avoid having too many query terms.\r\n\r\nGiven the thinned use of ngrams at query time the proposal is we can shift much of this thinning to index-time.\r\nThis may make some queries slower (less selective ngram queries on short query strings) but would save on disk space.\r\n\r\nThe question becomes how many ngrams do we drop and which ones? \r\nWe could drop ngrams containing what we consider to be punctuation or perhaps those that ==0 when hash/modulo N'ed.\r\nIn this issue I will report on experiments using some sample data and various approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
