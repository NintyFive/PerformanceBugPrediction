Regardless of the result size, Elasticsearch was creating int[100000], and eventually OOM'd as a result. We've been running the patch in afb2a5a for about a week now and despite the application continuing to make the same kind of requests, we're no longer experiencing OOMs.\n\nIt seems like this would help in terms of stability in memory use. I'm new to open source contribution and to ES, so I'm not sure what the standard process looks like, but I've filled out and submitted the forms described on the contributions page.\n\nAny thoughts around if/when this PR would get incorporated, or something I should be doing in order to help the process move along?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/28692407","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4156#issuecomment-28692407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4156","id":28692407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjkyNDA3","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-18T11:53:29Z","updated_at":"2013-11-18T11:53:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@markelliot Thanks for opening and fixing this issue!
