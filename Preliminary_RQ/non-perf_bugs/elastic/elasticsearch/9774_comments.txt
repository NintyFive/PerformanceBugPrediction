We are currently modifying the scripts to make them more uniform and we will remove this detection loop from the init script. If really needed, one could add it in the `/etc/default/elasticsearch` to set JAVA_HOME.\n\nTo me, the right behavior is: use `JAVA_HOME` if defined (in `/etc/default/elasticsearch` or anywhere else) otherwise `which java` will do the job.\n\n> Can we count on an empty JAVA_HOME being respected in future versions?\n\nYes.\n\n> I prefer the behavior of the default elasticsearch binaries: use JAVA_HOME if present but don't try to set it.\n\nI agree :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/76758744","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9774#issuecomment-76758744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9774","id":76758744,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NzU4NzQ0","user":{"login":"grantr","id":680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr","html_url":"https://github.com/grantr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-02T17:36:23Z","updated_at":"2015-03-02T17:36:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Great, thanks @tlrx!
