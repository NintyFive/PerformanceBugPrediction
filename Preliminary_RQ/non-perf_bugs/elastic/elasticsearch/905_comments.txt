And i do not understand the comment on this commit. I do not have much experience of working with fuzzy algorithms so that can be the reason of me not understanding the issue :)\nI've asked this question in more details on stackoverflow here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7148615/elasticsearch-fuzzy-matching-max-expansions-min-similarity\n\nCan you please answer it here or on stackoverflow. I will be very thankful :) I have very strict requirements regarding this so the search should produce understandable(at least to me) results.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
