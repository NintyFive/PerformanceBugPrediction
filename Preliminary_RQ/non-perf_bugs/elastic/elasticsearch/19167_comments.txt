I am interested in limiting the amount of listing I am requesting from the repo to give it a chance to respond within reasonable time. A timeout would still be considered a failure in this case.\n\nI'm not sure if all or any of the repo implementations use a fast-access index for listing purposes. It might just be that the Swift one is doing an exhaustive listing of objects in the container where it could have done something less expensive.\n\nMaybe our usage of snapshots is a little bizarre, but we can have several hundreds snapshot points over a long period of time. A way to filter by date range would be quite handy to maintain responsiveness in a list/select/restore UI.\n\nIn any case, having a way to specify parameters on  `GET /_snapshot/<repo>/...` seems like a useful addition to a repo plugin's API.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/356309176","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19167#issuecomment-356309176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19167","id":356309176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjMwOTE3Ng==","user":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-09T15:03:03Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T15:03:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the feedback. I think that you can achieve what you want by creating multiple repositories like `repository-2016`, `repository-2017`, `repository-2018` and list all snapshots created in 2017 using \r\n`GET /_snapshot/repository-2017/_all?pretty`.\r\n\r\nYou can apply the same naming convention in snapshot names, like `snapshot-2018-01-01`, `snapshot-2018-02-13`  and list all snapshots created in January 2017 using something like \r\n`GET /_snapshot/repository-2017/snapshot-2017-01-*?pretty` or `GET /_snapshot/repository/snapshot-2017-01-*?pretty`.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
