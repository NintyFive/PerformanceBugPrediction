Now, if I bring down Node A, Node B assumes the master status and gets the primary shard status. If I insert some new data into this cluster, then they get inserted fine within the primary shard on Node B. Now for instance, if Node B goes down before I bring up Node A, then Node A gets the primary shard status.(as expected it will not have the newly added data). Later, whenever Node B comes back up, Node A will wipe out the newly added data in Node B. There does not seem to be a good way to recover the data that was newly added. (Other than may be restoring from a backup)\n\nIs there any plan to resolve this issue so that 2 node instances can still have HA, or is it mandatory to have a minimum of 3 nodes to get HA?\n\nNote: If Node A is brought up before Node B goes down, then the cluster is all fine and dandy, and has the newly added data.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
