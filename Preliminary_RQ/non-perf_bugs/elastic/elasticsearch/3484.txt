This parallel array  approach makes sense from a java memory approach but for other languages (like Python, Ruby etc.) it's confusing and not really user friendly.  \n\nFurthermore, the term vector endpoint returns the nearly the same information as the [analyze endpoint](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/admin-indices-analyze/) does and the response format of term vectors should be consistent with analyze. The response for the above example would the become:\n\n```\n{\n   \"_index\": \"test\",\n   \"_type\": \"type1\",\n   \"_id\": \"1\",\n   \"_version\": 1,\n   \"exists\": true,\n   \"term_vectors\": {\n      \"field_with_positions_offsets\": {\n         \"field_statistics\": {..},\n         \"terms\": {\n            \"evil\": {\n               \"term_freq\": 2,\n               \"tokens\": [\n                   { \"position\": 4, \"start_offset\": 17, \"end_offset\" : 21 },\n                   { \"position\": 7, \"start_offset\": 40, \"end_offset\" : 44 }\n               ]\n            },\n            \"orthodontist\": {\n               \"term_freq\": 1,\n               \"tokens\" : [ { \"position\": 5 , \"start_offset\" : 22, \"end_offset\" : 34 } ]\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"brwe","id":4320215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjAyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4320215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe","html_url":"https://github.com/brwe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brwe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
