I have noticed that the ip the error logs above is \"10.0.0.208\" whereas after my laptop sleep, because I'm now home and not at work, my IP is actually 192.168.1.21.\n\nTo note to, I restarted only the elasticsearch server, it still fails. Then I only restarted the webapp. Still badly failing. And I could see that the number of thread in the elasticsearch server is then growing, probably it would have ended in another OutOfMemoryError. Restarting both of them make it work nicely and then the IP is the logs was then the 192.168.1.21, not the 10.0.0.208.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/1390392","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1043#issuecomment-1390392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1043","id":1390392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTAzOTI=","user":{"login":"hibnico","id":282823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjgyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/282823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hibnico","html_url":"https://github.com/hibnico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hibnico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hibnico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hibnico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hibnico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hibnico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hibnico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hibnico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hibnico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hibnico/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-06-17T19:33:11Z","updated_at":"2011-06-17T19:33:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I doesn't seems I can attach anything to this issue manager, so I'll paste here the meaningful (as far as I can tell) part of the stack trace I got just after the OutOfMemoryError:\n\n```\n\"elasticsearch[cached]-pool-1-thread-346\" daemon prio=5 tid=102be2000 nid=0x12a943000 in Object.wait() [12a942000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (on object monitor)\n    at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)\n    -
