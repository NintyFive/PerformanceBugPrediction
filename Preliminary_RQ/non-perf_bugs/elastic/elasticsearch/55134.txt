Maybe an environment variable called something like `ES_USE_BUNDLED_JVM`? Some systems may have legacy JVMs installed in order to support older applications which would be incompatible with ES. I don't expect this to be the case on production machines, but developer machines where they are evaluating the software or just hosting a local copy for development purposes.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be that during the startup-checks, if the found JVM on JAVA_HOME is too old, try and fallback to the bundled one.
