There was only one build in July (on `7.8`), and 6 in June (on `master` and `7.x`), which failed with a message similar to this. In each case, there were several other failures which indicate other problems with the build, such as `SocketTimeoutException`s.\r\n2) Failures similar to this are more common on pull-request builds, but from checking a number of impacted builds, it appears that there were issues in a few PRs (primarily related data streams and/or the REST compatibility layer) that caused widespread failures. The few I found where the failure fit this particular pattern appeared to be due to the contents of the pull request and were fixed before merging.\r\n\r\nAs all recent test failures I've found that appear similar to this one also appear to be caused by some relatively obvious cause other than failure of the test framework to properly clean up the cluster between tests, I believe this is no longer an issue on current dev branches. As such, I'm going to close this issue. Please re-open it (or a new issue and link this one) if failures like this start to occur with no obvious cause.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[1]: After excluding outliers. There were a few \"real\" problems which caused many failures with similar error messages in a narrow time window, all of which have since been fixed.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
