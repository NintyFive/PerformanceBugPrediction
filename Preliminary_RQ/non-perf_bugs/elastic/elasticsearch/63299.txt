first thing we did was write the operation to a buffered output stream which may or may not involve flushing the file. There are no guarantees at this point. After that, we marked some metadata about the operation being added to the translog.\r\n\r\nNow we add the operation to the buffer and increment metadata. After that, if the buffer is full, we flush. This is the first time we have the options for the mocked exceptions thrown in this test. Occasionally, the exception is thrown and our test infrastructure assumed this operation was not added successfully. However, it was and the metadata was incremented. So, the total operations are not what we expect.","closed_by":{"login":"tbrooks8","id":862472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjQ3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/862472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrooks8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
