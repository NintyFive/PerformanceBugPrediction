What matters with respect to the license is what you ship in the binary (included, I assume so it's not an issue there?) or what the developers that use es download and bundle themselves (through using maven). They can always choose to exclude the dependency for legal or other reasons in their own pom file. Lgpl and apache licenses are not incompatible as far as I know, though admittedly v3 and afferror are tedious to deal with from a legal point of view. \n\nBTW. I fully appreciate that you guys probably had lengthy internal debates on this already with your legal people and definitely don't want to reboot any of that (I had some exposure to that stuff in Nokia back in the day). Just curious what the legal reasoning is for setting optional to true.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/228031275","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13245#issuecomment-228031275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13245","id":228031275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODAzMTI3NQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T12:12:19Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T12:12:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reopening to discuss making JNA non-optional\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/228049018","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13245#issuecomment-228049018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13245","id":228049018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODA0OTAxOA==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:27:01Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T13:27:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Reopening to discuss making JNA non-optional\n\nWe just made it non-optional.
