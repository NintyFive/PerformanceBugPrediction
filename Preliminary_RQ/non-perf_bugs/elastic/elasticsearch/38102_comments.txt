An adoption of such an attribute in the specification would enable the client developers to set better expectations to users when they are using a feature. In C# for example we have mechanisms in the language itself for communicating this clearly in the intellisense system. It *may* even award us some grace when handling the impact of accidentally missing such changes. We could even generate our own \"stop the line\" signalling in the build process to ensure such changes are manually reviewed.\r\n\r\nLast count we are at 235 REST API specification documents.
