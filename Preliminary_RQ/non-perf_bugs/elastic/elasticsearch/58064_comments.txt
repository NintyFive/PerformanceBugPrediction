However, your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a specific problem with your setup more than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/644815233","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58064#issuecomment-644815233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58064","id":644815233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NDgxNTIzMw==","user":{"login":"danfinn","id":5891946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTE5NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5891946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfinn","html_url":"https://github.com/danfinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfinn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-16T14:51:12Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T14:51:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cbuescher I have posted on the support forum.

All we did was upgraded from 7.6 to 7.7 and we now are getting nothing written to indexes by elasticsearch and no errors at all either.  I am not sure what config option we would have enabled that would cause this?

Unfortunately, since there's no concrete indication of an error here (like an error or log message) that wasn't there before, I still think the forum is the right way to narrow this down. With the information currently available here I don't see how we can reproduce or investigate as a bug.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
