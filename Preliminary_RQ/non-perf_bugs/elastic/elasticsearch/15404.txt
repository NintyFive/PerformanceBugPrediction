I am finding this especially problematic.  A large number of programming languages use the period to denote calling a method / function on an object / struct.  In cases where logging is being used to pinpoint issues in code execution, this results in confusion when having to substitute these characters so that elasticsearch will accept them.\n\nConsider the usefulness of a case such as:\n\n``` json\n{ \"type\":\"net.Conn\", \"function\":\"Dial\", \"error\":\"could not connect\"}\n```\n\nThe technical solution for an end user is of course simple - replace the characters that Elasticsearch no longer supports with another character. However, the side effect of this is that the logs I have to change in order to accomodate Elasticsearch 2.x no longer supporting valid characters become more distanced from what I am trying to communicate with them.\n\nAm I missing something about this change?  I'm hoping that I am - but in my tests it does seem as simple as \"Elasticsearch no longer supports periods in field names, period\" - pardon the pun! ;)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
