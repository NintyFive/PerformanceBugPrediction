It is not a required feature, though, nor is it a out-of-the-box dependency. For the future, we want to improve our selection criteria (by node tag, etc) for Logstash's sniffing, so we won't need \"running http?\" as criteria.\r\n\r\nHowever ... \r\nLogstash does depend on [the `/_nodes/http` api ](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/blob/master/lib/logstash/outputs/elasticsearch/http_client/pool.rb#L37 )in order to perform sniffing. If this API is going away, I cannot tell from the discussion in this ticket.\r\n\r\nCan someone tell us if `/_nodes/http` is being removed as a part of this effort?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/299562091","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12792#issuecomment-299562091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12792","id":299562091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTU2MjA5MQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-05T20:01:25Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T20:01:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Can someone tell us if `/_nodes/http` is being removed as a part of this effort?\r\n\r\nWe would not, or at least, I would be opposed to removing it.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/299562966","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12792#issuecomment-299562966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12792","id":299562966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTU2Mjk2Ng==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-05T20:05:05Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T20:05:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All our language clients depend on `/_nodes/http` for sniffing.
