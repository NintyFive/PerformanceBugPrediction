I'm currently considering linking from:\r\n> \r\n> * The [`kv` processor](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/kv-processor.html) because it is one reason how users may end up with field names they don't have control of.\r\n> * The [`nested` field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/nested.html) because whenever users are tempted to create nested objects that have two `key` and `value` keyword fields, then it's likely a better fit for the `flattened` field.\r\n> \r\n> Any other ideas where we should link `flattened` from?\r\n\r\nAdding some links to the sections that Adrien mentioned.
