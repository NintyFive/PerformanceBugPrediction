However, while performing these upgrades, auto-follow patterns could continue to run creating new indices and starting replication, leading to problems during the rolling upgrades.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there needs to be ability to pause auto-follow patterns, and then the ability to resume them after the rolling upgrade is complete.
