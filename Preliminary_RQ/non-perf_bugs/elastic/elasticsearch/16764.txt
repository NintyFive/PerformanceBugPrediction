This makes a lot of sense as a direct generator is simply a term suggester that generate suggestions for the phrase suggester.\n\nUnfortunately, though, this value is overwritten when invoking the underlying Lucene `DirectSpellChecker` from [DirectCandidateGenerator](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/2.2/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/suggest/phrase/DirectCandidateGenerator.java#L115):\n\n```\nspellchecker.setThresholdFrequency(this.suggestMode == SuggestMode.SUGGEST_ALWAYS ? 0 : thresholdFrequency(frequency, dictSize));\n```\n\nignoring the parameter provided by the user.\n\nTo add to the confusion, the other frequency parameter `max_term_freq` works as expected.\n\nIt seems to be wrong to overwrite the `thresholdFrequency` on the spellchecker because the spellchecker is provided with the `suggest_mode` and already contains the logic to return the right terms according to the mode's rules.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
