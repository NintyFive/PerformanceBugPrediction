Sometimes these issues are due to bugs on our side (e.g., memory leaks) and sometimes they are due to pushing your cluster beyond its capacity. We want to help you, but without more information, we can't.\r\n\r\nWe prefer to keep only verified bug reports and feature requests on GitHub, and we use the forum to troubleshoot user issues. If it turns out there is a bug here, we would definitely reopen this issue and work on a fix. Would you please start a topic on the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) so that we can gather more information?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
