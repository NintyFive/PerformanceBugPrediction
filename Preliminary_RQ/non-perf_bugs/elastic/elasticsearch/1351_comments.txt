Not sure #1341 really is the same as this issue. This is my test case: I  trigger a delete with external version number 2 and then trigger an update with external version 1 (simulating message reordering). I am expecting the update to fail with a version conflict exception but it does succeed. When debugging I see the delete failing with a version conflict (current -1 but expected 2). The update then succeeds.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/2172861","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1351#issuecomment-2172861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1351","id":2172861,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzI4NjE=","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-09-22T21:41:45Z","updated_at":"2011-09-22T21:41:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yea, you are right, I missed that interaction model, will fix.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
