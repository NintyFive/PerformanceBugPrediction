If `p` is isolated from the cluster (e.g., through node failure, a flapping NIC, or an excessively long garbage collection pause), indexing operations can continue on `q` after `Q` is promoted to primary; these indexing operations will be acknowledged to the requesting clients. If `q` is subsequently isolated before `p` rejoins and before a new replica is assigned to another node in the cluster, the subsequent rejoining of `p` can currently lead to `P` being promoted to primary again. The indexing operations acknowledged by `q` will be lost.\n\nA mechanism needs to be built to prevent the automatic promotion of a stale shard in such a scenario and instead only promote a non-stale shard to primary (if a non-stale shard is availabie). The only scenario in which a stale shard should be promoted to primary is through manual intervention by a system operator (e.g., in cases when `q` suffers a total hardware failure).\n\nRelates #10933\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
