So we downloaded the source and ran the .sh in the folder. Now we changed the bind-address in elasticsearch.yml, after doing so Elasticsearch would not start again. Commented the bind-address back to its original state and it worked fine. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Download and Install Elasticsearch 5.4 on OpenSuse 11.4\r\n 2. Start Elasticsearch using the .sh script file\r\n 3. Change the bind-address in elasticsearch.yml, and try to start Elasticsearch again, it will not start.\r\n 4. Revert the changes in elasticsearch.yml back, and start Elasticsearch. This would work fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
