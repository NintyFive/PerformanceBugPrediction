What utilizers would need to do instead is collect the failures, understand what happened and eventually resend those documents if it makes sense.\n\nAlso, by default the `BulkProcessor` executes the bulk request in a non-blocking fashion, which means that `afterBulk` is called from a different thread than the caller. Throwing exception from there wouldn't make much sense. We could wrap the afterBulk in a try catch block and log if something happened, but not sure if it's worth it, I'd rather document that no exception should be thrown there.\n\nThat said, I don't get how this would result in closing down the transport, which seems quite bad but I can't reproduce it at the moment.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/50870062","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3761#issuecomment-50870062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3761","id":50870062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODcwMDYy","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T10:24:59Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T10:24:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing due to lack of feedback, feel free to reopen if you can reproduce it and post more info about it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
