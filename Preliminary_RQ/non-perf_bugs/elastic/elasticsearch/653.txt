The `index.merge.async` (which defaults to `true`) will cause merge operations not to happen on doc ops, but instead happen in the background. The `index.merge.async_interval` controls how often a merge will be checked if it needs to be initiated, defaults to `1s`.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
