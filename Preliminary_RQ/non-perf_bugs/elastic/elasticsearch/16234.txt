The `node.local` setting is a boolean. We read both as part of `DiscoveryNode#localNode` static method which gives the precedence to `node.local`, then reads `node.mode`, if none of the two is set it returns `false`.\n\nI am not sure why we have `node.mode` anymore, I think these two settings have the same effect and result in controlling which transport impl (local or netty) and which discovery impl (local or zen) is used. Unless I am overlooking something, we can deprecate one of the two. The boolean one seems the simpler the keep, what do people think about this?\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
