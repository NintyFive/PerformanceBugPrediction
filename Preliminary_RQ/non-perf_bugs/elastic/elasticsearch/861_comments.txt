It can be set to `store` and then you could use it for highlighting, however, this would be more problematic then useful I think. I am not familiar with internal implementation of `_all` filed but I would guess that it is in fact a single Lucene field that somehow concatenates all other fields together which means that it does not give you any hint about where content of one field ends and content of the other field starts. In other words best matching fragments could then contain mix of several fields. May be this is not a problem in some situations but usually this would not be very practical IMHO.\n\nI think you can go ahead and close this ticket, also I think that it would be better to discuss this topic on ML, I am not sure other can find it here easily.\n\nRegards,\nLukas\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/1025506","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/861#issuecomment-1025506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/861","id":1025506,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjU1MDY=","user":{"login":"lukas-vlcek","id":205174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/205174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek","html_url":"https://github.com/lukas-vlcek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-04-19T07:45:33Z","updated_at":"2011-04-19T07:45:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW I added note about this into http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/all-field.html\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/1026059","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/861#issuecomment-1026059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/861","id":1026059,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjYwNTk=","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-04-19T10:40:14Z","updated_at":"2011-04-19T10:40:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks.
