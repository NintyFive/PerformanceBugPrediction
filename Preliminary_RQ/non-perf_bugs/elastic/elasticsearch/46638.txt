This has a few benefits:\r\n\r\n1. This actually optimizes build cache efficiency since we aren't running multiple concurrent builds doing the same thing, which results in a sort of race-condition for the build cache.\r\n2. We cache sanity check issues early and avoid triggering a bunch of builds for things like compile or checkstyle issues.\r\n3. We limit the number of failure notifications sent for sanity check issues.","closed_by":{"login":"Conky5","id":946950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0Njk1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/946950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conky5","html_url":"https://github.com/Conky5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conky5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conky5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conky5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conky5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conky5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conky5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conky5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conky5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conky5/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
