I would like to format the output of the bucket (key_as_string) to show me name of the month (\"MMM\" format) but I want to provide min and max extended bounds as a simple datetime with format (\"\"yyyy-MM-dd\"). \n\nTaking the example below:\n\n```\n{\n\"aggs\": {\n    \"dateHistogram\": {\n        \"date_histogram\": {\n            \"field\": \"transactions.registryApplication.applicationDate\", \n            \"interval\": \"month\", \n            \"format\": \"MMM\", \n            \"min_doc_count\": 0, \n            \"extended_bounds\": {\n                \"min\": \"2011-01-01\", \n                \"max\": \"2011-12-31\"\n            }\n        }, \n        \"aggs\": {\n            \"averagePrice\": {\n                \"avg\": {\n                    \"field\": \"transactions.sellingPrice\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n}\n```\n\nI'm getting this error:\n\n```\n[failed to parse date field [2011-01-01], tried both date format [MMM], and timestamp number]\n```\n\nI mean that the format for input (bounds) and output (key_as_string field in response) should be separate, or expect the input date format to be of specific format.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
