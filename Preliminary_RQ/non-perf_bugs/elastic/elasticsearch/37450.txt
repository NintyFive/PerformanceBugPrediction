For example, given an existing index with type `my_type`, we allow new documents to be indexed using the typeless endpoint `index/_doc/id`. This is functionality is important in supporting the move to typeless APIs, since many users are likely to be working with older indices that were created with a custom type.\r\n\r\nThe approach in #35790 is fairly fragile, and we would like to step back and consider if there is something cleaner and more solid we could do instead. To help document the current implementation, here is the list of PRs associated with this work:\r\n- Make typeless APIs usable with indices whose type name is different from `_doc`. #35790\r\n- Rewrite SourceToParse with resolved docType. #36921 \r\n- Make sure to resolve the type in DocumentMapperParser#extractMappings. #37451\r\n- Give precedence to the type from index creation when applying templates. #37871 \r\n- Treat put-mapping calls with `_doc` as a top-level key as typed calls. #38032","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
