Elasticsearch detects and fixes those on start up.\n\nThen I figured it probably does this as well when you update the cluster settings and indeed it does, which is nice. This provides me a way to copy/move/rename indices without a cluster restart. So, for example this does the trick. Elasticsearch will detect any dangling indices and fix them:\n\n```\nPUT /_cluster/settings\n{\n    \"transient\" : {\n        \"discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes\" : 1\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it would be nicer if I could just do a PUT /_cluster/settings without a body since I don't actually want to change the settings and just reload the cluster state.\n\nThis currently fails with a somewhat obscure error (you may want to fix that)\n\n```\n{\n   \"error\": \"ElasticsearchParseException[Failed to derive xcontent from org.elasticsearch.common.bytes.BytesArray@1]\",\n   \"status\": 400\n}\n```\n\nfixing that with a \n\n```\n{}\n```\n\ndoesn't work either since it requires some kind of settings in there.\n\n```\n{\n   \"error\": \"ActionRequestValidationException[Validation Failed: 1: no settings to update;]\",\n   \"status\": 400\n}\n```\n\nA nice enhancement would be for PUT /_cluster/settings without a body to simply reload the cluster state. Unless I missed something, there's currently no other way to trigger this behavior via the API than as I described above. A PUT to /_cluster/state, which might be a better alternative, does not seem to work for example.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
