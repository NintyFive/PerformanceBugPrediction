And since URL fragments are never sent to the server Kibana didn't preserve them during SAML handshake. Moreover URL fragments used in Kibana can be pretty large so we can't store them in the session cookie like we do for SAML request ID. We're planning to change this in 7.5 (see https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/44513) and store full URL in the `RelayState` query string parameter we send to IdP and receive back once user is authenticated.\r\n\r\nAs we discussed with @jkakavas in https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/18392#issuecomment-525192963 it'd make sense for `_security/saml/prepare` API to accept the arbitrary string as an additional argument with  that will eventually be used as `RelayState` query string parameter in the IdP redirect URL this API returns.\r\n\r\ncc @kobelb ","closed_by":{"login":"jkakavas","id":10281256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgxMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10281256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas","html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
