(Happens if I specify an _id on index creation or let elastic search generate one for me.)  A duplicate result = _id being the same, as well as my _source.recid being the same. If I use a large \"size\" parameter then I don't get the duplicate results.  Is there something i'm misunderstanding?  If i happen to check for duplicates manually I never appear to get the proper unique entities. (ie... elasticsearch returns a report 259 records, but if I get one duplicate entry I will only get 258.\n\nBut again, if I do specify a large enough size so that the result set all fits in, then there is no problem...  I am sure that when adding to the search that everything is unique.\n\nTnx!\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
