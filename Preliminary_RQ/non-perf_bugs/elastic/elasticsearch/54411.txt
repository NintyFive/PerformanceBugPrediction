All of them, with the exception of **between** function deal with strings in a case insensitive way.\r\n\r\nCase insensitive functions\r\n- **arrayContains**\r\n- **endsWith**\r\n- **indexOf**\r\n- **match**\r\n- **startsWith**\r\n- **stringContains**\r\n- **wildcard**\r\n\r\nCase sensitive functions\r\n- **between** which has two additional parameters, one of which configures it to be case sensitive or not (default is `false`)\r\n\r\nThis issue is for deciding on a path forward regarding the case sensitivity aspect in [ES EQL string functions](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51556).\r\n\r\nProposals:\r\n1. ES EQL should mirror exactly the functionality in EQL\r\n - con: inconsistent implicit functions behavior\r\n - pro: the two implementations are fully compatible\r\n2. ES EQL should handle both cases of case sensitive and insensitive functionality by giving the users the power of choice through an additional functionality: LOWER and UPPER functions that should perform lowercasing/uppercasing. These two functions, combined with existent functions will help with case insensitive behavior. For example: `file where startsWith(lower(file_name), lower('expLORER.exe'))`\r\n - cons:\r\n   - a less user-friendly behavior, because users need to use an additional function for the same behavior they get in EQL\r\n   - ES EQL and EQL will diverge in functionality\r\n - pro: a more powerful functionality for users, since they now the possibility of matching exactly strings in their functions\r\n3. This is a variant of first option where, **by default**, the behavior of ES EQL will be the same as EQL, but offering users the possibility of changing this behavior through a session-level parameter (either fully case sensitive or fully case insensitive):\r\n - con: cannot use case insensitive and case sensitive functionality in the same query\r\n - pro: the two implementations are fully compatible\r\n\r\nThese are just some ideas and we don't have to choose one or another. The list is open for discussion, suggestions are welcomed.","closed_by":{"login":"astefan","id":893749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/893749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan","html_url":"https://github.com/astefan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
