But it is already computed for me and I've been able to access it with `my_last_object.meta.sort`. I've been able to understand that the sorted value for the date was a timestamp (number) and not a representation string of the date like `my_last_object.abs_timestamp` gave me.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nHope it will help others ;)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
