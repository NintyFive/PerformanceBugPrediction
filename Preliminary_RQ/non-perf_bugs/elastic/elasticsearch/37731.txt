It would be great to deprecate the use of `_type` in these requests, making sure to deprecate the relevant methods in the high-level REST response as well.\r\n\r\nThis API is likely less urgent to address than the others we've encountered, because a typeless request option is already available. In particular, it is already possible to omit the `_type` field in requests (it looks like a default of `_type` will be used if a type is not provided).","closed_by":{"login":"gwbrown","id":1522844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjI4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1522844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/gwbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
