happend to me. \n\nProblem:\ni did not want to do anything else but install the 2.2.1 version through yum. no other magic, only a simple `yum install ./elasticsearch-2.2.1.rpm`. then starting it gave me the blues `CONF_FILE setting is no longer supported. elasticsearch.yml must be placed in the config directory and cannot be renamed.`\n\nThe solution: \n`/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch` had the `CONF_FILE=/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` line it it, that the rpm install process didn't update. after a couple hours of searching where the hell did i define this environment variable i tripped upon that location. after commenting out that line, the elasticsearch service started. \n\n@dadoonet Please update the rpm/deb install process so it patches that file so that the service could start without a problem after the upgrade. if not, then please update your documentation to clearly state this possible problem and this solution.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/199812705","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16306#issuecomment-199812705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16306","id":199812705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTgxMjcwNQ==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T13:23:58Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T13:23:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks
