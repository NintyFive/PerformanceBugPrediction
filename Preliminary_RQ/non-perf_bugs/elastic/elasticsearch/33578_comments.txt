We don't want to add a new flag to the `unified` highlighter that would completely change the logic of the output so a new highlighter seems a better option. Some options will not be available due to how the logic is implemented, so for instance `require_field_match` would always be `true` since the Matches API ensures that the highlighted part are real \"matches\" in the document. I am closing this issue but opened https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34015 to track the addition of this new highlighter.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
