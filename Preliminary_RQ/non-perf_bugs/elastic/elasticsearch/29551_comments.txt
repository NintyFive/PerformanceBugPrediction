Previous 5.x minor versions like 5.5.x, 5.4.x etc. are not (fully) supported.\"\r\n\r\nThe 5.6 client sends all the parameters that Elasticsearch 5.6 supports, hence some parameters may not be recognized by earlier versions of Elasticsearch. Unfortunately there isn't even a work-around here as the parameter is always sent, the conclusion here is that the Search API cannot be used with 5.3 or earlier versions. We don't consider this a bug though as we never meant to support earlier versions than 5.6 when implementing the high-level REST client.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
