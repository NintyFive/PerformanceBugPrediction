However, some use singular and some use plural, eg:\n\nMappings:\n\n```\nPUT /index/type/_mapping\n{ type: { .... }}\n\nGET /index/{type|*|blank}/_mapping\n```\n\nSettings:\n\n```\nPUT /index/_settings\nGET /index/_settings\n```\n\nWarmers:\n\n```\nPUT /index/_warmer/name\n{ ... }\nGET /index/_warmer/{name|*|blank}\n```\n\nAliases:\n\n```\nPOST /_aliases\n{ actions: [....] }\n\n PUT /index/_alias/alias\n { ... }\n\n GET /{index|*|_all}/_alias/{alias|*}\n```\n\nThere are a couple of possibilities:\n\nDistinguish between singular and plural when PUT/POSTing\n\nCreate/update a mapping, warmer or alias (not settings) with: \n\n```\nPUT /index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer/{name}\n{ ... }\n```\n\nThis breaks bwc for mapping (`/index/type/_mapping` vs `/index/_mapping/type`) - possibly support both variants for all actions?\n\nCreate/update mappings, warmers, aliases, settings with:\n\n```\nPOST /index/_mappings|_settings|_warmers|_aliases\n{ name: {....}, name2: {....} ... }\n```\n\nRetrieve via singular or plural:\n\n```\nGET /index/_mapping|_alias|_warmer|_setting/{name|*|_all|blank}\nGET /index/_mappings|_aliases|_warmers|_settings/{name|*|_all|blank}\n```\n\nAlternatively, make singular/plural synonyms, so either can be used in any of the above examples\n\nOne final thing, all indices can be specified as `_all` or `*` (depending on the API), but eg warmers and aliases only understand wildcards.  I think `_all` should be an acceptable alias for `*`for all of them\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
