The first step is getting [LUCENE-2878](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2878) in, so that the postings highlighter can handle positions, as this is the highlighter that offers the most promise.  But that is just the start.  We need a big project which distills out the things that people really need from highlighting, and provides one single interface.  \n\nFor now, I'm just tagging all highlighting issues for easier reference later on.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
