I currently achieve this by fetching data from elasticsearch to a compute environment, summarizing the data by session and then ingesting the result into a summary index. When this analysis involves high-frequency events, it becomes prohibitively expensive to transfer and process large volumes of events. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if the output of an aggregation could be ingested as a new index without having to leave the cluster. I had expected that the reindex api could be used for this type of job, but was dismayed that the source query does not support aggregations.
