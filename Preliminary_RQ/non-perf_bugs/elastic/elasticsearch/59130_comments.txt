It might be possible to get around this using the functionality of the `core::CProgramCounters` class.  Those counters persist between runs, and already contain a counter for latest memory usage.  So it should be possible to add another for peak memory usage, get rid of `CResourceMonitor::m_Peak`, and use the program counter in its place.\r\n\r\nThis is only an idea - it needs a closer look to see if it will work in practice.  If it won't then we'll need an alternative way of persisting `m_Peak` between runs.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/654783046","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/59130#issuecomment-654783046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/59130","id":654783046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDc4MzA0Ng==","user":{"login":"przemekwitek","id":19312454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzEyNDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19312454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek","html_url":"https://github.com/przemekwitek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-07T11:15:57Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T11:15:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> This is only an idea - it needs a closer look to see if it will work in practice.\r\n\r\nThanks for the idea, I'll take a look.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
