Some questions come to mind:\r\n- Does the idea have merit ? Is it worth to further investigate what it would take to complete this migration ? \r\n- Would we need to maintain compatibility with Virtualbox  or should we just switch over completely? Comparability will  be more work, so what are the compelling reasons for it ?\r\n\r\nThoughts from @Crazybus @drewr also appreciated. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
