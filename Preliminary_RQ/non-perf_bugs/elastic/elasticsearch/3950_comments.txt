There is no ttl support for indices as a whole. There is an issue open requested that feature - so you can watch that for updates: #2114 \n\nIf you have anymore questions - can you please post them on the mailing list? we try to keep issues on github for feature request or bug reports.\n\nThx!\nBoaz\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
