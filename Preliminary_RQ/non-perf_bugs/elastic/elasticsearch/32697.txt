it's not possible to create a field alias before 6.4\r\n\r\nThose 2 index settings (/mapping) need to go in the `setup` section, but be skipped on versions before 6.4\r\nI _think_ that can only be done by moving these tests to a new `yml` file and skipping it all before `6.3.99` as I don't think we can conditionally skip 1 setup block based on BWC version (but I may be mistaken, I'm no
