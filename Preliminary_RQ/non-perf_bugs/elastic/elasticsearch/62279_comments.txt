Imagine we agreed to item 2, added that logging, but then could not close this issue because there were still several other parts. Having separate issues also allows for clear and focused discussions, rather than several overlapped discussions about different parts of the list. Could you please open separate issues for each enhancement you are describing?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, much of what is presented here is a solution, but it would help in both our understanding of what needs to be solved, as well as weighing options, if the actual problem were clearly presented with each. For example, again with the logging proposed in option 2, what is the the scenario that additional log information is needed? What log messages do you see now that lack context? What type of debugging of your system are you trying to do that the breaker name is needed?\r\n\r\nAs this issue is not actionable, I will close this, but please do open separate issues.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/693404524","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62279#issuecomment-693404524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62279","id":693404524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MzQwNDUyNA==","user":{"login":"lanerjo","id":20589998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTg5OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/20589998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanerjo","html_url":"https://github.com/lanerjo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanerjo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanerjo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanerjo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanerjo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanerjo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanerjo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanerjo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanerjo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanerjo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-16T13:27:17Z","updated_at":"2020-09-16T13:27:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rjernst I have split the more important items (IMO) out into a few enhancement requests. \r\n#62457 #62452  #62449 ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
