Elasticsearch comes with a well functioning service wrapper.\nUnfortunately, Logstash and Kibana don't...\nTo be able to install Logstash and Kibana as a service on Windows one has to use some other service wrapper - like for example the Non-Sucking-Service-Manager (https://nssm.cc/), which in contrary of its name, really sucks! Reason: terminating the service won't always also terminate all Logstash/Kibana related processes. Meaning if you restart a service, instead of killing all processes from the old one and instantiating new ones, you have duplicated processes running.\nThis is not how I imagine running Logstash and Kibana for a big project setup...\nBoth should come with as-easy-installable services as Elasticsearch.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
