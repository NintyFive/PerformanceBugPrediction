I discovered this because my search results are not parseable. Elastic search indexes the content successfully, retrieves it successfully and hands back the original content in search results even though it was invalid json. \n\nMy csv contains two columns with an id and a json string. However, due to a bug in my csv generation, some lines got corrupted and actually contain four columns. In that case the last three columns get handed off to elastic search as the json object by my bulk indexing tool. The first of these is actually valid json and Elasticsearch seems to pick that up and ignores the rest of the line.\n\nI would preferr Elasticsearch to fail on this at index time and be more strict. \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
