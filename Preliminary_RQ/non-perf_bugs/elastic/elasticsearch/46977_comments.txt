I assume you've added a document like the following, and are not expecting your search above to match it?\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT stuff/_doc/1\r\n{\r\n  \"myRangeField\": {\r\n    \"gte\": null,\r\n    \"lte\": null\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifying `null` for `gte` or `lte` indicates that the range is unbounded in that direction. So the document's range field should be thought of as `(-infinity, infinity)`, which certainly matches against the provided range query.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want the document to be included in the result, you could omit the field `myRangeField` completely (instead of just setting its bounds to `null`).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/534478645","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46977#issuecomment-534478645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46977","id":534478645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDQ3ODY0NQ==","user":{"login":"Hemric","id":7724770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MjQ3NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7724770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hemric","html_url":"https://github.com/Hemric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hemric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hemric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hemric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hemric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hemric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hemric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hemric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hemric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hemric/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T09:37:50Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T09:37:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @jtibshirani, thanks for answering !\r\n\r\nThat is exactly what i did.\r\n\r\nI wasn't aware *null* should be though here as *-infinity, infinity*.
