The default value for MaxHeapSize is `physical RAM / 4`. On large machines, these numbers can be larger than what fits into a 32-bit integer, but that's what JDK 8 tries to print, so max heap sizes will be truncated. Some common values get truncated to 0, unfortunately. You can test this out by supplying such values as arguments to the `-Xmx` parameter.\r\n\r\nUsing Powershell, the results come out like this:\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\william_brafford\\elasticsearch> C:\\Users\\jenkins\\.java\\java8\\bin\\java.exe -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -Xmx3g -version | select-string MaxHeapSize\r\n\r\n    uintx MaxHeapSize                              := 3221225472                          {product}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is the correct value, i.e., 3g => 3221225472 bytes. But:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Users\\william_brafford\\elasticsearch> C:\\Users\\jenkins\\.java\\java8\\bin\\java.exe -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -Xmx8g -version | select-string MaxHeapSize\r\n\r\n    uintx MaxHeapSize                              := 0                                   {product}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's not right! Or rather, `(8 * 2^30) % (2^32) = 0`. Any multiple of 4 GB will have this problem, since `4GB = 4 * 2^30 B = 2^32 B`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our Windows tests are executing on instances with 96 GB RAM, meaning the 24GB max heap size is getting truncated to 0 in the output that we're parsing.\r\n\r\nJDK 9 and beyond don't have this problem, and the master branch uses JDK 11 for the runtime, so that's why we aren't seeing this issue on master.\r\n\r\nAs for the fix — is there a way to make this test meaningful, given that there's a bug in the JDK 8 output? Also, is this a potential problem on Linux, or is it Windows-specific? I'll keep digging on this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/544621470","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/47384#issuecomment-544621470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/47384","id":544621470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDYyMTQ3MA==","user":{"login":"williamrandolph","id":3253644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTM2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3253644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph","html_url":"https://github.com/williamrandolph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-21T17:29:12Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T17:29:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The behavior turns out to be system-dependent — \"uintx\" holds the correct values on my Mac, but not on my Windows test machines.\r\n\r\nThe JDK bug report flagging this issue is here: https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8074459\r\n\r\nSince the problem behavior is in the JDK and not in our code, I think I will put out a PR that skips this test only on affected systems.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/544629166","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/47384#issuecomment-544629166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/47384","id":544629166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDYyOTE2Ng==","user":{"login":"williamrandolph","id":3253644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTM2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3253644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph","html_url":"https://github.com/williamrandolph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-21T17:47:58Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T17:47:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On second thought, this bug might have some consequences for our ergonomic settings on affected machines.

Thus, when this bug is present and the value is not defined, we'll get the wrong `io.netty.allocator.type` setting when physical memory is between `N * 16g` and `(N * 16g) + 4g`, for some natural number N.\r\n* When `MaxDirectMemorySize` is unset, JvmErgonomics sets it to `MaxHeapSize / 2`. On affected systems, this means we will get an incorrect setting for `MaxDirectMemorySize` when the value is not defined and physical memory is greater than `16g`.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the workaround is for the user to define the value or upgrade to a JDK more recent than 8.
