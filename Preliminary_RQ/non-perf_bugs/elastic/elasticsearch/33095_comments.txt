the missing response above which is pretty bad, I would say at first glance that it's ok for the validate query API to require a query to be provided. Looking at the code though, I see that the request has a match_all default, which sounds like maybe something has changed at some point in the REST layer where we end up setting null to the request while we should leave the default that is already set to the request?
