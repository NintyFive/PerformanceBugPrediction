Although they should be mutually exclusive, it is possible for users to define options for both approaches which is confusing because only the second approach is applied. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Insert a document into an empty index:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /my_index/doc\r\n{\r\n    \"load_time\": 20\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run the following aggregation from the docs but specify `tdigest` and `hdr` options:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /_search\r\n{\r\n   \"aggs\": {\r\n      \"load_time_outlier\": {\r\n         \"percentiles\": {\r\n            \"field\": \"load_time\",\r\n            \"percents\": [99],\r\n            \"tdigest\": {\r\n               \"compression\": 200\r\n            },\r\n            \"hdr\": {\r\n               \"number_of_significant_value_digits\": 3\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Actual outcome**: It produces results.\r\n* **Expected outcome**: Specifying options for both `tdigest` and `hdr` should be considered invalid and Elasticseach should throw an Exception.","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
