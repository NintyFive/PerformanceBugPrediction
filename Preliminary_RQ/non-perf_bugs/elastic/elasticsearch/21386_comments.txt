For example I have an `event` model with custom user attributes with nested arrays. Events come with different structures all the time so I can't use mappings explicitly in order to tell ES which attributes are nested. For my case ES should treat arrays of objects always as `nested`. So what is a good way to handle such cases? Am I missing something?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
