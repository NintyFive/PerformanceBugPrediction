are several features that we would like to add that require fast retrieval of geo shapes and can greatly benefit from having docvalues support for geo shapes.\r\n\r\nThis issue has gone through a lot of evolution, so this description is edited to reflect\r\nthe latest reality\r\n\r\nThe work for adding geo_shape support for geo_centroid, geo_bounds, geotile_grid, geohash_grid aggregations was accomplished in x-pack by way of the following PRs:\r\n\r\n- geotile_grid/geohash_grid (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/55966)\r\n- geo_centroid (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/55602)\r\n- geo_bounds (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/55328)\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by implementing by migrating geo_shape mapper registration\r\nto a module (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/53562) and then defining the geo_shape with doc values in the spatial plugin (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/55037)","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
