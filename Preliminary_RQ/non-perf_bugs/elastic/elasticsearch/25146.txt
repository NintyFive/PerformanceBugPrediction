Using \"standard\" http requests we encountered problems as you can run in several limitations, like body size, buffer limits, timeouts and so on. Therefore we had to implement an own client that supported http streaming requests so we could upload and download large data.\r\n\r\nIt would be really helpful to have an option for using http streaming in the Java Rest Client and therefore in the Java High Level Rest Client.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"arosenheinrich","id":5214937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTQ5Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5214937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich","html_url":"https://github.com/arosenheinrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arosenheinrich/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
