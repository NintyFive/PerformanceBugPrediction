In the case of Ubuntu, which we use, that packaging system is deb/aptly. Our RPM systems use dnf/yum.\r\n\r\nWe don't allow any of our systems to use bespoke software distribution systems, as these become an operational nightmare. Elastic is just one part of a larger system that has to be managed, and supporting exceptions is not something we allow.\r\n\r\nOur systems make heavy use of autodeployment - there are no user serviceable parts in our systems. As a result, having a human or some bespoke process to handle the special case of downloading the plugins is not something we can automate safely.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, faced with a non-packaged project, we would add the packaging ourselves and contribute that packaging back to the project so we don't have to support that modification ourselves. In this case the gradle build in elasticsearch is a step too far in terms of complexity. We do not have skills in gradle, or groovy, and we do not practically have access to resources with those skills. For reasons that are unclear gradle is importing a custom written plugin written in groovy, to build a software project developed in java.\r\n\r\nOur workaround is to build some simple maven projects to generate the debian packages we need. Unfortunately the elasticsearch release process publishes elasticsearch proper to maven central, but some time back publishing the plugins broke, and the only plugins available are obsolete.\r\n\r\nWhile there are obvious workarounds we can deploy, each of those workarounds need to be performed by us, documented by us, and then maintained by us, as opposed to just using packages deployed by the elasticsearch project.\r\n\r\nThe elasticsearch project publishes packages, which is excellent. But elasticsearch has not packaged plugins, which causes immense headaches for people trying to deploy elasticsearch.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/367546680","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28762#issuecomment-367546680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28762","id":367546680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzU0NjY4MA==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-22T02:28:36Z","updated_at":"2018-02-22T02:28:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for explaining your situation, the context is helpful.\r\n\r\nWe have considered the idea of enabling the plugins to be installed via package managers (nb. not distributed with the Elasticsearch packages, that would increase the size of the distributions by entirely too much).
