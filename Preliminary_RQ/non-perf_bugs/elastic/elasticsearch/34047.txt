Index has a field defined like this (FOSElastica bundle YML configuration):\r\n```\r\n    shape:\r\n        type: 'geo_shape'\r\n        tree: 'quadtree'\r\n        precision: '10m'\r\n        distance_error_pct: 0.001\r\n```\r\n 2. Indexing many shapes in 6.4.1 that worked in 6.3.2 results in `caused failed to parse` error.\r\n 3. Adding `ignore_malformed: true` doesn't seem to help.\r\n\r\nIt looks like there was some sort of undocumented BC break regardless of the shapes being fully proper. If you want I can provide you an example of a shape.","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
