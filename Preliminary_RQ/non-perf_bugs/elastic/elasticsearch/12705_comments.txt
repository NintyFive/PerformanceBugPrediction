If you want to filter _source fields, you should consider combining the already existing _source parameter (see Get API for more details) with the filter_path parameter like this:\n> curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_search?pretty&filter_path=hits.hits._source&_source=title'\n\nI'm closing the issue since this is not a real bug, feel free to reopen if needed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
