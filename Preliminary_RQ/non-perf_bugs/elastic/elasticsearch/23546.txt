Looking at the output of /{index}/_segments?verbose=true shows a lot of BlockTreeItems, FST, and postings that are in-memory.  For a really old index, having the ability to reduce its in-memory footprint while still leaving it open would be beneficial.  Going through a close/reopen process causes the cluster to go red a lot and if a node goes down, we have to make sure that any closed indices on that dead node are re-opened so that the replicas get moved to other nodes.\r\n\r\nThis could be a call like /_cache/clear that we have to run periodically.  So the index itself doesn't have to worry about whether it is \"cold\".  If the new call is run, the index moves the in-memory data to disk and the next time a query hits it, it brings the data back to memory.  Then later, we would manually run the call again to move it back to disk.","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
