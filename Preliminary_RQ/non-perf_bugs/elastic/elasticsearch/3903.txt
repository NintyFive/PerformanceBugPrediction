Everything looks ok to me here.\n\nThe [second script](https://gist.github.com/lukas-vlcek/6972064) (which is based on the original recreation scripts from #3881) shows that the `search_analyzer` does NOT kick in and yield correct results ONLY if stated explicitly. Not sure if I understand what it is fundamental difference between the use case in first script and use case in the second script. Both scripts have very similar structure and unless I made some typo there I do not understand why the search analyzer haven't been used automatically.\n\nBoth scripts were tested against the latest master:\n\n```\nElasticsearch version and build:\n{\n  \"ok\" : true,\n  \"status\" : 200,\n  \"name\" : \"Anelle\",\n  \"version\" : {\n    \"number\" : \"1.0.0.Beta1\",\n    \"build_hash\" : \"9a062e465ce86aa9a72dd6dd5337be6447a83506\",\n    \"build_timestamp\" : \"2013-10-13T15:08:48Z\",\n    \"build_snapshot\" : true,\n    \"lucene_version\" : \"4.5\"\n  },\n  \"tagline\" : \"You Know, for Search\"\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukas-vlcek","id":205174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/205174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek","html_url":"https://github.com/lukas-vlcek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
