The search source is now stored as an object instead of as bytes and so SearchSlowLog will now print the json search request in the slow log rather than the binary bytes. \n\nNote that until https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10217 is fully complete there will still be some elements of the search request (e.g. sort parameters) which will be rendered as binary bytes since until these are refactored they are still stored in the Search request as bytes.\n\nClosing in favour of the mentioned PRs/issues\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
