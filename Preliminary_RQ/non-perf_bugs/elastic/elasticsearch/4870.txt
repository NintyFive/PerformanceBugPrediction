For example, user forget change keyboard layout and starts typing query \"кув ырщуы\" wich means \"red shoes\". It will be nice to have filter, that transforms token \"ырщуы\" into two tokens \"ырщуы\", \" shoes\". Of couse, i can make it by myself, but it will be more kindly for all users of elasticsearch if those code will be unified and incapsulated into search engine.
