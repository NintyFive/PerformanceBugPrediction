What if it were possible to define a script on an alias that runs on incoming documents and emits an index name? Sort of like an alias filter.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_aliases' -d '{\n    \"actions\" : [\n        {\n            \"add\" : {\n                 \"index\" : \"logs-20150316\",\n                 \"alias\" : \"logs-daily\",\n                 \"placement\": {\n                   \"lang\": \"groovy\",\n                   \"script\": \"\n                     date = new Date().parse(doc['timestamp'])\n                     'logs-' + date.format('YYYYmmdd')\"\n                 }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nIn real life, the script would probably be defined in a file instead of dynamic. If the script doesn't return a valid index name, the usual \"multiple indices matched\" error could be thrown.\n\n/cc @drewr @TwP\n","closed_by":{"login":"grantr","id":680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr","html_url":"https://github.com/grantr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grantr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
