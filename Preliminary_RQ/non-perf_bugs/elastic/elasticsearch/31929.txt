A subsequent query could return stale data, which may be even true if a custom preference value is used, because it just hashes the client to a given shard, which may be yet to be updated (while asking the primary would return correct result). Two different clients could get two different results for the same query in the same time this way (or given that all clients use the same custom preference could all see the same stale data).\r\n\r\nOne could argue that using wait_for_active_shards is the solution here, but even if it's working correctly in this manner (ie: all replicas and the primary are updated atomically from the PoV of the client, which I guess is not true), it would require that all of the shards are always available for writes, which makes replication somewhat useless, or at least much less useful.\r\n\r\nGiven all of these, I would like to ask you to restore the _primary option for preference.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
