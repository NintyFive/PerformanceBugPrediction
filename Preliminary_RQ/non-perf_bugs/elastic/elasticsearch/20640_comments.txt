In particular, the suggestion of a wildcard template (`\"index_patterns\" : [\"*\"]`) with the setting to allow auto-creation as a means of backwards compatibility is not possible with the new component/composable templates. Because of this, the latest thinking on this is that we should implement a flag for component/composable templates which overrides `action.auto_create_index`. This way, most cases will continue to use the behavior of `action.auto_create_index`, but we can ensure that our internal indices will be able to be auto-created as necessary.\r\n\r\nWith this proposal, we have the option of deprecating and removing `action.auto_create_index`, but per our discussion today we are likely to allow them to coexist, with the index template flag overriding `action.auto_create_index`.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
