However, my query receives only this:\n\n```\norg.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException: Alias [myindex] has more than one index associated with it\n```\n\nIs this a bug, or am I simply doing something incorrectly?\n\n**This query performs only a search, nothing is written**. Query below:\n\n```\n// Java Client, \"index\" being my alias\nesClient.prepareGet(index, type, id).execute().actionGet();\n```\n\nCurrently using v1.3.1.\n\n**Update:** Seems that this may only be an issue with `esClient.prepareGet` (i.e. the Search API does this correctly), which leads me to believe it's probably me doing something wrong.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
