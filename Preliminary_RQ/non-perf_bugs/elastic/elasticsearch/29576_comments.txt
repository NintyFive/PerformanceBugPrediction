Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead.\r\n\r\nFor a quick reference, the issue where the functionality you refer to was deprecated is https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/8049. I glanced at it quickly but couldn't find a satisfying quick answer to your question, but maybe you want to review that first. If you open an issue in the forum, please also include your use case (why you need the different tokenization). This will hopefully get you a better answer sooner. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/382339932","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29576#issuecomment-382339932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29576","id":382339932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MjMzOTkzMg==","user":{"login":"nishantsaini","id":5706169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDYxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5706169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantsaini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantsaini/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-18T10:22:49Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T10:22:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cbuescher\r\nThanks for the suggestion.
