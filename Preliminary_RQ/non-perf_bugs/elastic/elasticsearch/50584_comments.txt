If you are working on something and you have questions about why it's not working the way you expect it to, please head over to https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch . There is a much bigger crowd over there that can help you figure it out. If it turns out it's a bug, we'll open a Github issue and discuss fixes/mitigation. Please also post as much detail as possible to make the issue reproducible and highlight the expected vs the actual results.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
