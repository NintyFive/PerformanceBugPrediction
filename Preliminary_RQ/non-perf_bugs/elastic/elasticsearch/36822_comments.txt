the logs were helpful. The issue you are facing is related to #29025: the first cluster state update from the new master causes all the nodes to try and re-establish their connections to the old master, expecting this either to succeed or fail immediately. However Docker's network doesn't behave as expected: if the container has completely gone away, connection attempts receive no response and eventually time out. Worse, we try twice before continuing, so it takes two connection timeouts (each 30 seconds by default) before the cluster proceeds.\r\n\r\nI would reset your `ping_timeout` since it's actually making things a bit worse here, and instead consider reducing `transport.tcp.connect_timeout` until #29025 is resolved.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/449354532","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36822#issuecomment-449354532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36822","id":449354532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTM1NDUzMg==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-21T10:43:12Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T10:43:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Duplicates #29025.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/449362230","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36822#issuecomment-449362230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36822","id":449362230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTM2MjIzMA==","user":{"login":"kimxogus","id":11684628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg0NjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11684628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimxogus","html_url":"https://github.com/kimxogus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimxogus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimxogus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimxogus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimxogus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimxogus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimxogus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimxogus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimxogus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimxogus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-21T11:17:32Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T09:57:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you 👍 \r\nreducing `transport.tcp.connect_timeout` to 2 ~ 3 seconds made outage around 8 ~ 10 seconds.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
