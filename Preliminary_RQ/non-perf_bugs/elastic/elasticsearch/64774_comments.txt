I think a global-ords-based solution is something we could have fairly easily. The trouble is that most of the time when we have global ords implementations they are speed ups for a \"Map\" based solution as well. I don't think a map based solution would work as well in this situation. But I'll have a think. Would it be ok to only do global ords at first? That means that things like runtime fields wouldn't work here.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/724723176","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/64774#issuecomment-724723176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/64774","id":724723176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNDcyMzE3Ng==","user":{"login":"dgieselaar","id":352732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjczMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/352732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgieselaar","html_url":"https://github.com/dgieselaar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgieselaar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgieselaar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgieselaar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgieselaar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgieselaar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgieselaar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgieselaar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgieselaar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgieselaar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-10T14:06:01Z","updated_at":"2020-11-10T14:06:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nik9000 we are not using runtime fields, so I'm (selfishly) totally okay with leaving that out.
