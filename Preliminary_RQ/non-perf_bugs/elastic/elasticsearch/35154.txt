Is this file coming from you? This might be a false positive as I've seen similar reports: https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/clamav-found-mirai-trojan-in-slack-snap/7194/7\r\nBut if it is you may want to warn clamav to they can fix the issue, or at least confirm this so people knows they can ignore this warning (when they find this issue) or delete this file (If I don't use the report plugin I guess I can delete this file?)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Install kibana from official repository (x-pack is included by default? I dont remember installing it) \r\n 2. `cd /usr/share/kibana/node_modules/x-pack/plugins/reporting/.chromium`\r\n 3. `clamscan --max-filesize=4000M --max-scansize=4000M`\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
