is no method in the Java API on SearchRequestBuilder to set the global highlighting options for 'fragment_size' or 'number_of_fragments'.\n\nThe documentation lists this ability in the 0.90.X series

series:\n\nhttp://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/0.90/search-request-highlighting.html#highlighting-settings\n\nhttp://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-highlighting.html#highlighting-settings\n\nI am working around this by using the method:\n\naddHighlightedField(name, fragmentSize, numberOfFragments)\n\nBut that is not ideal since my fragmentSize and numberOfFragments doesn't change on a per
