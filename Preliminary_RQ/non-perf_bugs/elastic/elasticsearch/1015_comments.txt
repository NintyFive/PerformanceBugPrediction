This makes it very hard to limit ES to a certain amount of memory, which is important as there are other processes running on the node, too. I'd like to have more control on the RES memory usage, because the node eventually goes for swapping and gets really slow.\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/1015\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/1354164","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1015#issuecomment-1354164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1015","id":1354164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTQxNjQ=","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-06-12T07:59:38Z","updated_at":"2011-06-12T07:59:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"closing this, since there isn't really much that I can do about it...\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
