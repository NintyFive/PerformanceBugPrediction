Elasticsearch relies on grep to help construct command-line arguments\r\nfor the java command that is executed by bin/elasticsearch. This results in special bash\r\ncolor code characters which result in parsing errors.\r\n\r\nerror:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Could not find or load main class -Xms2g\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis `-Xms2g` is here only because it is the first argument that matched `-`, where grep has colored\r\nthe `-` in such a way that it does not get parsed successfully by the java command as an argument, and thinks it is a class name.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. run elasticsearch like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ GREP_OPTIONS='--color=always' bin/elasticsearch\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Proposed fix**:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n+++ distribution/src/main/resources/bin/elasticsearch\r\n@@ -56,7 +56,7 @@ fi\r\n \r\n parse_jvm_options() {\r\n   if [ -f \"$1\" ]; then\r\n-    echo \"$(grep \"^-\" \"$1\" | tr '\\n' ' ')\"\r\n+    echo \"$(grep --color=never \"^-\" \"$1\" | tr '\\n' ' ')\"\r\n   fi\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nnot sure if this solution is platform-agnostic, maybe different OSes have different greps","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
