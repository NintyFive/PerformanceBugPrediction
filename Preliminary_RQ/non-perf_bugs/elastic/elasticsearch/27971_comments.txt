Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a support question than a bug report. In particular, a bug report would need much more detail in order to help us try and reproduce what you're seeing, which isn't possible from the limited information you give above. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
