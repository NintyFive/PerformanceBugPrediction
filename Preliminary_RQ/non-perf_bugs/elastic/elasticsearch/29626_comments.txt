In #29585, we removed the side-effect caused by assertion then this test started failing. This failure can be explained as follows:\r\n\r\n- Step 1: Index a doc then delete that doc\r\n\r\n- Step 2: The version map can switch to unsafe mode because of concurrent refreshes (implicitly called by flushes)\r\n\r\n- Step 3: Index a document - the version map won't add this version value and won't prune the tombstone (previously it did)\r\n\r\n- Step 4: Delete a document - this will return NOT_FOUND instead of DELETED because of the stale delete tombstone\r\n\r\nThis failure is actually fixed by #29619 in which we never leave stale delete tombstones.\r\n\r\n/cc @bleskes","performed_via_github_app":null}]
