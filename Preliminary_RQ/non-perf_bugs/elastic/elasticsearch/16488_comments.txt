I'd like to be able to do the same with ElasticSearch.\n\nI'm interpreting this to mean that you want automatic and unattended _upgrades_ to the Elasticsearch installation. I advise _very_ strongly against this, or any other course of action that does not involve testing that an upgrade is not to going to break your dependencies of Elasticsearch. An unattended upgrade for a server process is _very_ risky and such an upgrade should be performed deliberately. There is such an incredible variety of things that can cause issues including plugins not working, performance regressions, deprecated APIs being removed, etc. Even for a patch upgrade with the rigorous testing processes that we have in place, we can not account for every setup and use case. Computers are hard.\n\n> I'm checking elasticsearch (2.x) repo file and unfortunately, it doesn't contain Origin and Suite is empty which is a problem.\n\nThe above disclaimer out of the way, I do not see a reason for this to not be fixed.
