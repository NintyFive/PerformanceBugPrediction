The former contains only a single example, and could be enhanced to contain additional examples that users would find useful. For example:\r\n```\r\nGET _cat/indices?health=yellow\r\n```\r\nFor the `cat shards` API, we could enhance the examples by explaining the returned parameters more. For example, explaining in this [example with a single index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/cat-shards.html#cat-shards-api-example-single) what each returned value correlates to. We indicate in the introduction that the `cat shards` API returns for each node \"...if it's a primary or replica, the number of docs, the bytes it takes on disk, and the node where itâ€™s located.\" Perhaps it bears repeating that information in the context of an example?\r\n\r\nThese changes are fairly nominal, but I'm happy to make them if they would prove helpful to our users.\r\n\r\nP.S. - I find it curious that the `cat indices` API is used to return shard count.

I think this issue dates back to a time when we didn't list the query parameters at all in these docs (see, e.g. [how we described `GET _cat/indices` in 5.6](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/cat-indices.html)).
