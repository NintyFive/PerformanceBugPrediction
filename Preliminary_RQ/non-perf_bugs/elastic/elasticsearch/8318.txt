As Kibana requires access from browser to ES directly, ngnix is expected to provide the security. However I see following error in browser:\n\n\"Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://<MyDomain>:19200/_nodes. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.\"\n\nI tried 'add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;' and several other techniqus to enable CORS without any success.
