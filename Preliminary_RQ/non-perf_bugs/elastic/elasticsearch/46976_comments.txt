Looks like the parser might have broken mid parsing or something?  E.g. two incorrect matches were:\r\n\r\n- `max_score: expected [null] but not found`\r\n- `the_movfn: value: expected [null] but not found`\r\n\r\nBut both of those match the response output that was dumped into the log:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"stash\" : {\r\n    \"body\" : {\r\n      \"took\" : 4,\r\n      \"timed_out\" : false,\r\n      \"_shards\" : {\r\n        \"total\" : 3,\r\n        \"successful\" : 3,\r\n        \"skipped\" : 0,\r\n        \"failed\" : 0\r\n      },\r\n      \"hits\" : {\r\n        \"total\" : {\r\n          \"value\" : 7,\r\n          \"relation\" : \"eq\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"max_score\" : null,  // <-- here\r\n        \"hits\" : [ ]\r\n      },\r\n      \"aggregations\" : {\r\n        \"my_date_histo\" : {\r\n          \"buckets\" : [\r\n            {\r\n              \"key_as_string\" : \"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n              \"key\" : 1420070400000,\r\n              \"doc_count\" : 3,\r\n              \"the_sum\" : {\r\n                \"value\" : 550.0\r\n              },\r\n              \"the_movfn\" : {\r\n                \"value\" : null  // <-- here\r\n              }\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              \"key_as_string\" : \"2015-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n              \"key\" : 1422748800000,\r\n              \"doc_count\" : 2,\r\n              \"the_sum\" : {\r\n                \"value\" : 60.0\r\n              },\r\n              \"the_movfn\" : {\r\n                \"value\" : 550.0\r\n              }\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              \"key_as_string\" : \"2015-03-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n              \"key\" : 1425168000000,\r\n              \"doc_count\" : 2,\r\n              \"the_sum\" : {\r\n                \"value\" : 375.0\r\n              },\r\n              \"the_movfn\" : {\r\n                \"value\" : 305.0\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe date formats are strange though:\r\n\r\n`key_as_string: expected String [2015/01/01 00:00:00] but was String [2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z]`\r\n\r\nThe test is definitely looking for `2015/01/01 00:00:00`.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't reproduce for me though which is odd.  There's no randomization here, just a doc test.  Should fail consistently...
