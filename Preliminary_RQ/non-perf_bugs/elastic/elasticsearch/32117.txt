cryptic\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: source key not found in the source settings\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven Tribe is deprecated in 6.x and removed in 7, we don't want to do much

Don't allow secure settings for `xpack.security.*` on tribe nodes. That is, in `addTribeSettings` fail if we find a secure setting (with a reasonable error message)\r\n2.
