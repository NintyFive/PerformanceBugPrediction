Mostly?\n\nThe thing is that when you install elasticsearch using the deb `/var/log/elasticsearch` is created properly and `bin/plugin` doesn't go and create log files owned by root even if you run it as root. Which is how you normally run `bin/plugin`. I just checked it on trusty.\n\nThe tar package is different. If you run `bin/plugin` as root there you'll get the problem above. But luckily, you don't really have to run `bin/plugin` as root using the tar distribution. So this is only a problem for silly people like me who always run it as root because they are used to doing so.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
