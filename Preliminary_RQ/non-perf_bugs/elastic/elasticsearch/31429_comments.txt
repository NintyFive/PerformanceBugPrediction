The 5.x documentation has a note that \"the `rescore` phase is not executed when `sort` is used.\" (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/search-request-rescore.html and earlier 5.x versions) while this is relaxed in 6.x and master to say \"An error will be thrown if an explicit sort (other than _score) is provided with a rescore query.\" (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.x/search-request-rescore.html), which is actually what I get when I try to run a simplified version of your query on 6.3.\r\nI found this issue that introduced throwing that error instead of silently ignoring the rescore phase which dicusses several arguments around why this isn't supported: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/26510\r\n\r\nHope this clears things up and you don't mind me closing this.
