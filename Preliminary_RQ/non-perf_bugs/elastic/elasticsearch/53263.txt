support of the upcoming [geo_shape doc values and aggregation](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37206) feature (licensed Basic). The `doc_values` field mapper parameter needs to be available in both `GeoShapeFieldMapper` and `ShapeFieldMapper` when the spatial xpack module is loaded, and the basic license is available. If the spatial xpack module is not available, existing OSS behavior should remain the same (e.g., `MapperParsingException` when `doc_values` parameter is explicitly provided by the user).\r\n\r\nThis issue will capture discussion and track progress on the design and implementation for overriding `doc_values` field mapper parameter through the Spatial x-pack module.\r\n\r\nThe Spatial Doc Value Parameter [Feature Branch](https://github.com/nknize/elasticsearch/tree/feature/SpatialDocValueParameter) is available for review and discussion and provides the following behavior:\r\n\r\n* if the Spatial xpack module is available the `doc_values` parameter defaults to `true` for `GeoShapeFieldMapper` and `ShapeFieldMapper` \r\n* if the spatial xpack module is available the `doc_values` parameter throws an Exception for new `geo_shape` fields defined using the legacy PrefixTree indexing approach (same behavior as before)\r\n* if the Spatial xpack module is not available (e.g., OSS) the `doc_values` parameter defaults to `false` for `GeoShapeFieldMapper` and `ShapeFieldMapper` (same behavior as before) \r\n* if the spatial xpack module is not available (e.g., OSS) explicitly setting the `doc_values` parameter throws a `MapperParsingException` (same behavior as before)\r\n* backwards compatibility is supported\r\n\r\nThe behavior is achieved using the following [\"hack\"](https://github.com/nknize/elasticsearch/commit/db144f4bf1a97e5fe336832e61960d4687e90b92):\r\n\r\n* a new `GeoShapeFieldMapper.Extension` is loaded through SPI that overrides the `GeometryIndexer` that adds the `indexDocValues` logic\r\n* a new `AbstractGeometryFieldMapper.ParserExtension` is loaded through SPI that supplements `TypeParser.parse` logic to parse the `doc_values` parameter in the spatial xpack module\r\n* `IndicesModule.java` is \"hacked\" to load the `ParserExtension` and `DataLoader` objects from xpack that provides the overriding behavior described above\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
