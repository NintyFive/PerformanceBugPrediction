However, in the context of this bug Elasticsearch will not have successfully started (because an old plugin prevents that). This means that no changes would be made to files on disk (e.g., the cluster state) so the previously-installed version will still be able to read these files. This is why downgrading is safe here while typically it is not.\r\n\r\nRegarding how to downgrade, I can not answer this because I do not know how you install Elasticsearch, nor how you upgrade Elasticsearch.
