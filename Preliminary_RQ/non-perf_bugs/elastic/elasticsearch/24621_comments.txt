We only interpret '-' as a negation when it is preceded by a wildcard expression. The fact that an alias was used is irrelevant, `/foo-1,-foo-2/_search` gives the same result as `/read,-foo-2/_search`. I would lean towards leaving everything as-is given that #20898 was a great improvement and I wouldn't want to go back. @dakrone what do you think?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/309058375","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24621#issuecomment-309058375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24621","id":309058375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTA1ODM3NQ==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T15:33:45Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T15:33:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree with @javanna, the reason why we only interpret `-` as a negation when preceded by a wildcard expression is that prior to #20033 we allowed indices to be created that started with `-`, so we need a way to be able to select those indices for a query.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/309060141","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24621#issuecomment-309060141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24621","id":309060141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTA2MDE0MQ==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T15:40:42Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T15:40:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dimitris-athanasiou would you be ok with closing this given the above explanation?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/309439160","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24621#issuecomment-309439160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24621","id":309439160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTQzOTE2MA==","user":{"login":"dimitris-athanasiou","id":9351617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTE2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9351617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitris-athanasiou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-19T13:27:53Z","updated_at":"2017-06-19T13:27:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@javanna I see.
