I also reproduced this on going from `2.3.3` -> `5.3.0`.\r\n\r\nThis causes Kibana to not properly grab the index mappings when defining an index pattern rendering all fields as neither searchable nor aggregatable. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n1. Create an index mapping with a geo_point field\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT index\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"type\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"geo_field\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"geo_point\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add a sample document\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT index/type/1\r\n{\r\n  \"geo_field\": \"33.8957, -112.0577\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Upgrade to 5.3.1 (I simply copied the data directory over)\r\n\r\n4. Attempt a `_field_stats` call on the geo_field\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET index/_field_stats?fields=geo_field\r\n```\r\nThe response\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"_shards\": {\r\n    \"total\": 5,\r\n    \"successful\": 4,\r\n    \"failed\": 1,\r\n    \"failures\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"shard\": 3,\r\n        \"index\": \"index\",\r\n        \"status\": \"INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR\",\r\n        \"reason\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"exception\",\r\n          \"reason\": \"java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5\",\r\n          \"caused_by\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"execution_exception\",\r\n            \"reason\": \"java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5\",\r\n            \"caused_by\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"array_index_out_of_bounds_exception\",\r\n              \"reason\": \"5\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"indices\": {\r\n    \"_all\": {\r\n      \"fields\": {}\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
