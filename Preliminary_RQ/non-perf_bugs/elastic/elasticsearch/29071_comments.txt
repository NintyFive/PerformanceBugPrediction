Though this behavior has been broken in 5.6 during the refactoring of the parent/child so the workaround for now is to explicitly copy `ignore_unmapped` in the  `inner_hits` builder. I opened https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/29261 to restore the old behavior, this will remove the need to re-set `ignore_unmapped` on the `inner_hits`, the value will be inferred from the parent query (in your example the `nested` query).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
