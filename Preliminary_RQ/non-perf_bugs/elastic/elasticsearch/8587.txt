tests run into a failure this morning which is caused by the verification of the old adler 32 checksums we added recently. \n\nhttp://build-us-00.elasticsearch.org/job/es_bwc_1x/5047/CHECK_BRANCH=tags%2Fv1.2.4,jdk=JDK7,label=bwc/\n\nthe problem here is the following\n- index was created with es `1.2.4` which still records Adler32 checksums in the legacy checksum file\n- we flush but apparently the last segment `_h` didn't make it into the commit but was recorded in the checksums file. \n- we uprade the node to `1.4.1-SNAPSHOT` - the index opens just fine\n- we apply the transaction log and IndexWriter starts writing a segment `_h`\n  - note: now we have a Adler32 checksum for `_h` in the checksum file but the files are actually not the once that where checksummed.\n- since we have a replica we initiate a recovery and in our `Store.java` code line `#638` we prefer the adler checksum even though we could get the original checksum from lucene.\n- on recovery we now compare the checksums and they obviously don't match - in turn fail the primary :-1: \n\nI think the fix here is to prefer new checksums since they are taken from the file if we know we have them....\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
