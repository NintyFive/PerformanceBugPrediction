If I create the index and add some parent and child docs, the has_parent filter doesn't work until I restart the server. However, this only works once. If I add additional child docs, or if I update the existing ones, the results of the has_parent filter don't reflect the changes. It's as if the filter is working with a stale copy of the data set - very weird...\n\n---\n\nI was wondering if someone on this thread could help me. The has_parent fork was working really nicely, but has now suddenly stopped working - which has left me thoroughly confused!\n\nI haven't changed anything as far as I know. I downloaded and built @flxs's branch 3 months ago and it worked just fine. But when I revisited my test index today it seems to be broken. The has_child filter continues to work as normal, but has_parent seems to ignore newly indexed documents. Sometimes restarting the server will make it pick them up but mostly not.\n\nCan anyone think why this might be?
