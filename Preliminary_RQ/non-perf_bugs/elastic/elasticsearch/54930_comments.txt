While Jason's PRs do show how one would add another architecture to the Elasticsearch build, the decision on when to add such support is more complicated. We prefer to not take on contributions that we do not intend to support because it can end up being confusing to our users, and it's difficult for us to maintain. In the case of ARM, while we do not yet officially support it, we are looking at doing so, and thus made the change to enable further testing. However, at this time we still do not intend to support `s390x` or `PPC`.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
