Before #62480 for testing equality we were ignoring the provided bucket and were generating a string that was generated by all the elements in the runLens array.

Before it did not fail because the original  HyperLogLog++ contained more buckets.","closed_by":{"login":"iverase","id":29038686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDM4Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/29038686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase","html_url":"https://github.com/iverase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
