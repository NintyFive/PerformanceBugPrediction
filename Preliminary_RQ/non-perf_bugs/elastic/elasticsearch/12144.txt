Data is send to nprobe, which in turn writes it natively to elasticsearch. \nElastic search version: 1.5.2\nKibana version: 4.0.2\n\nI do a \"uniq count\" of \"IPV4_SRC_ADDR\" for a single destination address. \nX-Axis: \nAggregation: Date Histogram\nInterval: Minute\nThis give me around 10 to 20 uniq IP's in average. Now, when I switch to an \"hourly\" Intervall, I get an average of 100 !\n\nThis becomes FAR WORSE when I do a \"sum in_bytes\" aggregationover 2 days. While the system measures around 200 kb/s, kibana switches to an multi hour aggregation and reports 140m bytes. I assume that \"m\" stands for \"million\" ?  I can only get \"realistic\" information if I split the timeframe in much smaller pieces and push the interval to minutes / seconds. \n\nWhy is there such a grave, misleading difference in aggregation when doing a \"sum\"? And why is the only hint for this problem the very tiny \"info\" icon above the interval?\nI understand, that doing a \"sum\" on a timeframe of 2 hours will sum all available data to a single point in the graph. Is there any way to warn about the fact, that the aggregation has a \"blur\" factor of X? Where X is the Factor of the Interval?\n\n![screen shot 2015-07-09 at 09 34 07](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1741662/8590312/9ed3c28a-261f-11e5-80a2-e3590a40ce01.png)\n![screen shot 2015-07-09 at 09 34 25](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1741662/8590313/9ed451dc-261f-11e5-987e-958a0c59b08a.png)\n","closed_by":{"login":"new-gen23","id":1741662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDE2NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1741662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-gen23","html_url":"https://github.com/new-gen23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-gen23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-gen23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-gen23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-gen23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-gen23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-gen23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-gen23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-gen23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-gen23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
