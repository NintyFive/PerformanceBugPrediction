The empty component template shouldn't have to define the timestamp field mapping, right?\r\n\r\nThere are going to be a two changes:\r\n* The timestamp field for a data stream is going to be fixed to be '@timestamp', until we figure out what would be the best way to make this field configurable (or at least make sure that the timestamp itself can be provided via another field).\r\n* If no field mapping is going to be provided for the '@timestamp' field then a default mapping should be applied. This is what #58642 is doing. Since #58642 is doing more than that, I will extract that particular piece of the pr and open a new pr, once the first change has been merged.
