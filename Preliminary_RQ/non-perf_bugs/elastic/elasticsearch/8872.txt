If the user needs to filter on the `_type` field, then they should include an explicit filter.\n\nWildcarded field names will still be supported, eg `name.*` or `*.first`. Wildcards will apply to the whole path.\n\nFor bwc, we should add a static setting to allow the old method of field resolution in the 2.x series.\n\nRelates to #8870\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
