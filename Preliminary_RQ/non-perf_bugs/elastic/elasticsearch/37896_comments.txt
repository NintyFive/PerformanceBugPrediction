This test failed few times over the last two months since CI became slow. It seems that we triggered a flush, but CI was too slow to finish it in several seconds. I added the flush stats and commit stats and unmuted this test in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/ed460c28159172b4ea06800dc909ed72a5ace800. We should have a good clue if this test fails again.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
