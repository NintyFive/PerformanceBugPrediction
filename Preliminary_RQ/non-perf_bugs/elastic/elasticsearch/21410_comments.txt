That breaking change was in a major release (good thing), though IMO unnecessary (distinct issue). It should be added to breaking change docs regardless. There's now _another_ change proposed in #21417 that's breaking _not_ in a major version change (bad). That's an issue in itself, and just bad behavior for any project.\n\nThe documentation fix is appreciated, but what are we fixing here? The strict parameter parsing is good, but would adding this as a recognized parameter and maintaining behavior be a bad thing? Then when a monitoring system hits these routes, it's not version switched per version. When things like this break, I'm not only fixing our monitoring system (both Bosun and Opserver), **everyone else** is also doing this. And that's bad, because this break wasn't really necessary.\n\nNo one's asking that we revert strict parameter parsing, the ask if much smaller in scope: recognize this parameter. It was allowed and documented to be allowed past the 5.x release (the live docs still have it).\n\nMore globally, the monitoring APIs in general are the thing most likely to need many-version support at once. Any changes that aren't _really_ necessary here are painful, multiplied by the number of systems hitting them. As a user, what's the benefit here? How many lines of code would it take in elasticsearch to make this work? The current version would need to _just ignore it_. Is that a big ask? What's happening right now is we've gone from a route that worked fine to throwing a 400, for...what? How much code did we save? Was it worth the pain caused to users?\n\nThis is broken. There's no fix for it. Users are on 5.0.0 and I have to support them. The ship has sailed and either monitoring systems _specifically_ don't support this exact version (if the behavior did go back), or we already have to have this fork in our code. For probably a decade.\n\nBut what's the bigger issue here? Breaking changes are proposed for a 5.1.0 or (even worse) a 5.0.x in #21417 is **very bad**. These should absolutely not be allowed. If I have no idea if my stuff will break in the most minor of releases, then I won't upgrade. That's bad for everyone. There are really good reasons that semantic versioning exists and this is a primary example. Please, don't let this happen. Elastic has to take breaking changes seriously if they want people to be on a version anywhere near current. If users can't trust an upgrade, then they won't. Things like this (if deployed) destroy such trust, instead of building it. \n\nI honestly have no idea if Elastic (in general) strives to maintain semantic versioning, but even if that's not the case, can we at least get on the same page with breaking changes?

We have had so many issues opened because our APIs silently ignored unknown parameters.  We have largely fixed this - we now tell you when you're doing something wrong, and we provide suggestions for which parameters you probably wanted to use.  This is a huge step forward in usability.\n\nThe `all` flag was removed in 1.0, along with the `clear` and various metric flags.  The bug was that we didn't remove all the documentation about the `all` flag, but it hasn't worked since 1.0.  I understand your point about how ignoring the `all` flag silently in 5.0 wouldn't make a difference, but why is the `all` flag different from the other flags?  Maybe you are only using the `all` flag but there may be others using the other flags, which also haven't worked since 1.0. If we silently ignore those too, we leave users guessing about why things aren't working the way they assume instead of telling them immediately what the problem is.\n\nRegarding the strict checking of metrics in #21417.  We have formally embraced strict REST parsing in 5.0 - shouting loud and shouting early saves users so much time and heartache, the benefits are clear.  If we find APIs that still accept unknown parameters, it is considered a bug which should be fixed, not a breaking change.\n\nIf we continue silently ignoring unknown metrics, we're punishing all of those users who don't understand why their requests aren't working correctly.  We can add backwards compatibility and deprecation logging for the `percolator` metric, which is no longer available, but how does it help users to ignore unknown metrics?  Most users are probably unaware that they have a problem and would be grateful for being told what the problem is.  While we could delay this change for 6.0, it would mean another year where users are left in the dark.\n\n> The ES team has been extremely aggressive with breaking changes and it has been very painful to update my apps to accommodate these changes. I really hope that you guys got the cleanup done that you wanted to do and that the bar for breaking changes goes up drastically going forward. Otherwise I'm afraid you are going to fragment and alienate your customers.\n\n@ejsmith We're trying hard really hard to balance these two camps: not hurting existing users and making things better for new users. This is not an easy choice.  We don't make breaking changes lightly and when we do, it is with the intention of moving to more stable APIs.  The breaking changes between 1.x and 2.0 were hard for everybody, 2.x to 5.0 should be a much easier experience.  We don't always get it right but please be aware that a lot of soul searching goes into these decisions.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/259404746","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21410#issuecomment-259404746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21410","id":259404746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTQwNDc0Ng==","user":{"login":"NickCraver","id":454813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDgxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/454813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickCraver","html_url":"https://github.com/NickCraver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickCraver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickCraver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickCraver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickCraver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickCraver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickCraver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickCraver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickCraver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickCraver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T12:34:53Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T12:34:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> it is considered a bug which should be fixed, not a breaking change\n\nThese are orthogonal issues, and not at all mutually exclusive. Any change can be both, as is the example here. That doesn't change the fact that breaking changes should be reserved for major versions. Yet repeatedly, with this project, they are not. This contributes greatly to people not upgrading. It's one of the reasons we don't upgrade often here.\n\n> This is not an easy choice. We don't make breaking changes lightly\n\nI'm sorry but not that's not how this is coming across. [The original comment here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/21417#issuecomment-259277331) was \"somebody talk me down from putting this in a 5.0.x release\" (I hope that's exact, if not it's very close) with an emoji on it. I really wish I had the tab open with a screenshot (maybe someone else still does). If you want to carefully consider changes and what goes into things that's fine, but saying that happened here is bull. The fact that comment was edited shows it's recognized.\n\nElasticsearch is your project. Do what you want with it. But don't assume this has zero impact. If I have to weigh heavily testing every release for breaks because Elastic doesn't care about semantic versioning and is therefore shifting the burden to me (and every other user), then it's worth it one again to spend equal time evaluating other options all together. Would we move to Solr here? I have no idea, but it's absolutely worth investigating again, because the time factor went from low and known to completely unknown and significant. When we upgrade Stack Overflow to a new bugfix release, will it break production? Because you're \"helping\" me with these breaking changes? Well now we have no confidence in that. \n\nThe point of versioning and semantic versioning is that, as a user, **I know what I am getting**. If it's a x.0.0 upgrade, I know there will be breaks. If there are breaks hiding in build or minor releases, then I a) have to test far more heavily for every change, and b) now expect surprises when we deploy production. That's unhealthy, at best. Semantic versioning exists for extremely good reasons. I'm really not seeing that anyone at Elastic gets that in this issue. Instead, the comments and actions here indicate the exact opposite.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/259408696","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21410#issuecomment-259408696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21410","id":259408696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTQwODY5Ng==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T12:57:49Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T12:57:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'm sorry but not that's not how this is coming across.
