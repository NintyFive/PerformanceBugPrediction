It's used in multi index operations like bulk, multiget, multisearch and multipercolate, which allow to specify an index in the url and potentially override it in the request body (the index in the url will then only be used as a fallback). By setting `rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index` to `false` (default `true`) you can prevent users from overriding the index name in the request body, to be able to implement [url-based access control](), as you can tell from the url which index gets accessed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/34990490","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5092#issuecomment-34990490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5092","id":34990490,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTkwNDkw","user":{"login":"mbarker","id":999721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTcyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/999721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarker","html_url":"https://github.com/mbarker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-13T15:39:54Z","updated_at":"2014-02-13T15:39:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It looks like the functionality I want was added in the just release 1.0: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/4453\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/34995069","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5092#issuecomment-34995069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5092","id":34995069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTk1MDY5","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-13T16:20:04Z","updated_at":"2014-02-13T16:20:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"True @mbarker, `allow_no_indices` might help.
