BUT, earlier in the constructor of this class the call here throws an error if this name is defined in the configuration:\n\n```\nMap<String, Settings> groupSettings = settings.getGroups(THREADPOOL_GROUP);\n```\n\nThe reason is that the getGroups call checks that all settings prefixed with `threadpool.` must be \"grouped\" i.e. qualified with the name of a threadpool e.g. `threadpool.search.size`. \nConsequently we cannot possibly change the default setting of this interval and the need to do so has emerged as part of controlling search timeouts (see \"Setting timer accuracy\" section of https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/9156). A [PR](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/9168) for this timeout issue includes a fix that changes the setting name to `threadpool.search.estimated_time_interval`. \n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
