Mixing up analyzers is likely to give you broken offsets and positions which could prevent indexing or result in run time exceptions with eg the FVH.\n\nOn top of that, you're messing with term statistics by creating duplicate terms for tokens which analyse identically, so the relevance calculation will be poor. \n\nLastly, you don't actually save much space compared to having a field per analyzer.  And even if you do today, things may well change tomorrow as Lucene adds optimisations for its primary use case.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
