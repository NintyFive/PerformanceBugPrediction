Especially since they don't work together. We could have, for example, just the `validate`, `validate_lat` and `validate_lon` options and have the accepted values as `error`, `normalise`, `no`.\n\nAlso do we need three settings for validate? Are there really use cases where people need to validate or normalise latitudes and not longitudes? Could we have just a single `validate` option which works on  both lat and lon?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/76506483","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9859#issuecomment-76506483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9859","id":76506483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NTA2NDgz","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-28T02:49:39Z","updated_at":"2015-02-28T02:49:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is there ever a reason why you would want to accept invalid geopoints?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/89726543","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9859#issuecomment-89726543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9859","id":89726543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg5NzI2NTQz","user":{"login":"RolphH","id":10166243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTY2MjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10166243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RolphH","html_url":"https://github.com/RolphH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RolphH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RolphH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RolphH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RolphH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RolphH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RolphH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RolphH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RolphH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RolphH/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-05T06:11:49Z","updated_at":"2015-04-05T06:11:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is geopoint [null, null] considered to be invalid, then yes, there is a reason.
