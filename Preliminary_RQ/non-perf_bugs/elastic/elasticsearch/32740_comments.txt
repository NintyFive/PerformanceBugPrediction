This work was a little delayed as we were evaluating different options for the Lucene rollbacks, in particular in light of Lucene's new soft-delete feature. If you have more questions on this, please open a topic on `discuss.elastic.co` and ping me there. Github is meant to be mainly used for feature requests and bug reports.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
