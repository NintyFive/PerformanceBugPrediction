When using GeoJSON, the coordinates should be given with the format [[minLon, maxLat], [maxLon, minLat]].\r\n\r\n In your case minLon = -121 and maxLon = -124. This means that minLon > maxLon, therefore is a bounding box that crosses the dateline and the longitudes between -124 and -121 are excluded.
