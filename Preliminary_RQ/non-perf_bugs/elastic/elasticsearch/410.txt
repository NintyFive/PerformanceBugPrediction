A `script_field` option allow to provide a script that actually provide the terms to use. The `script_field` (or `script`) with automatically be used when no `field` or `fields` are provided.\n\nAs an example, a search request (that is quite \"heavy\") can be executed and use either `_source` itself or `_fields` (for stored fields) without needing to load the terms to memory ( at the expense of much slower execution of the search, and causing more IO load).\n\n```\n{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"match_all\" : {  }\n    },\n    \"facets\" : {\n        \"my_facet\" : {\n            \"terms\" : {\n                \"script_field\" : \"_source.my_field\",\n                \"size\" : 10\n            },\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"match_all\" : {  }\n    },\n    \"facets\" : {\n        \"my_facet\" : {\n            \"terms\" : {\n                \"script_field\" : \"_fields['my_field']\",\n                \"size\" : 10\n            },\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs a side note, joining the results of one or more term facets simply requires using the same facet name ;).\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
