However, when retrieving or invalidating the above API key, user A's realm will be used. This creates a problem for queries with `owner=true` and leads to empty result set, e.g. `GET -H 'es-security-runas-user: B' /_security/api_key?id=keyId&owner=true`.\r\n\r\nThis feels like a bug and it is better to have consistent behaviour for how runas realm is handled for all API key security operations.
