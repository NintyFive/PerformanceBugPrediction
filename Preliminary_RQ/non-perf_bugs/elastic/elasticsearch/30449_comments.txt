I can confirm this is a problem in 5.2.2 and it reproduces nicely (thanks!). I can also confirm this isn't an issue any more with 5.6.5. I tried to find the changed that fixed this but failed. These things are very tricky and the problem is typically far from where the exception occurs. I'm going close this as fixed. I suggest you upgrade to avoid this.
