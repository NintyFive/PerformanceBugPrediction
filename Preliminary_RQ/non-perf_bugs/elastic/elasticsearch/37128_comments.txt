In this particular case, because `full.name` is a `text` field (as opposed to `keyword`s where it gets the values from `docvalue_fields`), SQL creates a query that will ask for\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"_source\": {\r\n    \"includes\": [\r\n      \"full.name\",\r\n      \"name\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"excludes\": []\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen it gets back the results, it will parse the source and try to extract a parent field called `full` and its sub-field called `name`. In JSON this is represented as `\"full\": { \"name\": \".....\"}`. But, in the case of document with id 1, the source is `\"full.name\": \"Shane Connelly\"`. SQL will not know what field is `\"full.name\"` because it won't split the fields following dots, so it will put `null` as the value.\r\n\r\nShortly put, SQL knows how to handle `\"field\": {\"sub_field1\":\"\", \"sub_field2\":....}` replies and no dot notations (`field.sub_field1.X.Y....`).\r\nWe should \"normalize\" what we get back from ES and transform the result in one form only (the curly brackets one probably) and handle that forward.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
