Doc 3 wasn't returned in the search hits, so either it wasn't available for search at the time or it didn't get indexed, unclear which.  The bulk has `refresh: true` so it should be search-able immediately.  \r\n\r\nSo the doc failing to index seems most likely, but impossible to know since we don't have the bulk response from the setup.  Maybe the index wasn't fully initialized despite the create index API succeeding?  Dunno.\r\n\r\nClosing since I don't think there's anything we can do here.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
