As far as I understand the problem is that the field name is stored directly in index and it is not possible to use it later with different type settings.\n\nSo how it will behave if in one index I have two types with mappings that have different types for the field named e.g. `height` in both? It would also give the same errors?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/134139433","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8877#issuecomment-134139433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8877","id":134139433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDEzOTQzMw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-24T10:31:18Z","updated_at":"2015-08-24T10:31:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jasisz in 2.0 we explicitly forbid creating fields of the same name with conflicting mappings, for the same reason\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
