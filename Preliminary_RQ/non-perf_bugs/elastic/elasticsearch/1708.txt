It can then follow by a math expression, supporting `+`, `-` and `/` (rounding). The units supported are `M` (month), `w` (week), `h` (hour), `m` (minute), and `s` (second).\n\nHere are some samples: `now+1h`, `now+1h+1m`, `now+1h/d`, `2012-01-01||+1M/d`.\n\nNow, when doing `range` type searches, and the upper value is inclusive, the rounding will properly be rounded to the ceiling instead of flooring it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
