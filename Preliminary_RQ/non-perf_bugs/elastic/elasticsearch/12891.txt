#11060 (issue #10979), the request headers and context of the originating request were copied to all sub-requests. In doing some testing on master, I noticed that in the `ScriptService#getScriptFromIndex` the headers and context were not being copied due to the lack of a `SearchContext`. To see what calls were affected, I added an assert to check if the context was null. When doing so the following tests trip the assertion:\n\n```\n- org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.pipeline.BucketScriptIT.indexedScript\n- org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.metrics.ScriptedMetricIT.testInitMapCombineReduce_withParams_Indexed\n- org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.pipeline.BucketSelectorIT.indexedScript\n- org.elasticsearch.validate.RenderSearchTemplateIT.indexedTemplate\n```\n\nThere were also two rest test failures for the Render Search Template API. For the render search template api, we need a way to pass in the headers/context in a way that isn't a search context because it is not a search request.\n\nFor the other failures, it appears that the subsequent requests happen after the SearchContext has been cleared/released.\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
