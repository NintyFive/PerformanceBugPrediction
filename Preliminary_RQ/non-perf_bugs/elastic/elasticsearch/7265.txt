Moreover in one place in code only exact value \"true\" is interpreted as boolean true.\n\nClass DiscoveryNode reads both properties two times. Once calls appear in nodeRequiresLocalStorage, and second time in dataNode and masterNode methods.\n\nIn nodeRequiresLocalStorage method Settings.getAsBoolean is called but in second and third case only Settings.get is called and then value compared with \"equals\" to String \"true\".\n\nI think values shouldn't work different in different places. Second thing is that probably Boolean values shouldn't be case sensitive.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
