Your question is better suited to the user forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/344547793","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27390#issuecomment-344547793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27390","id":344547793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDU0Nzc5Mw==","user":{"login":"Hexmagic","id":11594791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk0Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11594791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/Hexmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hexmagic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-15T10:16:24Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T10:16:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thankyou","performed_via_github_app":null}]
