just like to emphasize a little, as I don't see it really mentioned and wouldn't like it to be overlooked, that my biggest gripe isn't so much the _messiness_ of it - it's more the lack of ability to

It's huge page containing every option, so I need to 'ctrl-f' to find the section I'm looking for. It feels overwhelming and it's easy to lose my place and end up in a different section.\r\n* The sections aren't grouped together by theme. For example, `docvalue_fields`, source filtering, and `script_fields` are split apart. It's hard to know what's available and compare options.\r\n\r\nSome ideas:\r\n* In the short-term, perhaps making these into collapsible sections could help?\r\n* Some sections seem like good candidates for their own page. For example, the highlighting section is extensive and could be a separate subpage.\r\n* We could group certain options together in terms of their use like 'Returning field values from a search'. Perhaps this would fit best as sections of the 'search your data' reference.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
