This path was (erroneously?) added back into the docs for Windows only in a subsequent PR:  https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/40375.\r\n\r\nAttempts to update license at the documented endpoint fail, but removing the `_xpack` path succeeds:  `http://<host>:<port>/license`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1.
