For example if someone launches [a long reindexing job](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html) and later on tries to have an idea about the progress, there is no strong identification of the task. As a human you might make a guess, but with several similar reindex jobs run concurrently, a programmatic decision is impossible.\n\nTherefore I propose that all API calls that may result in entries in the tasks list carry a supplementary parameter, say `task_tag`, that would be tied to the respective task (so that in the `_tasks` reply you may identify it). It's safer than directly specifying a task ID and has less code impact.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
