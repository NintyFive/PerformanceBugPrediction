For this purpose we use other components of the stack (beats and logstash for instance). You should open an issue in these repos directly. We can also help you in the forum (https://discuss.elastic.co/t) if you want to write such processors by providing advices on the best way to send data to es. For these reasons I hope you don't mind if I close this issue, I'd be happy to help on the forum if you have any questions related.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/374950509","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29180#issuecomment-374950509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29180","id":374950509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDk1MDUwOQ==","user":{"login":"hijakk","id":2235149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzUxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2235149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hijakk","html_url":"https://github.com/hijakk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hijakk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hijakk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hijakk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hijakk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hijakk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hijakk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hijakk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hijakk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hijakk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-21T14:12:07Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T14:12:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @jimczi - I had a call with Tristian Ahmadi (@tris325) and Matt Campbell on the issue.
