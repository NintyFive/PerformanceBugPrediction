If you want to be able to rollback an upgrade you need to have a snapshot of the old cluster (or, in some cases, a copy of the old data directory).\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could help resolve the issues you had with 7.0, and allow you to roll forwards instead?  \r\nIf you'd like to attempt than, then please open a topic on our  [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/). This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. The discussion forums are beter suited to these sorts of troubleshooting and problem diagnosis conversations.\r\n\r\nSince the situation you've found yourself in is not a supported path, there isn't really a bug or feature request for us to resolve here. As such I hope you don't mind if I close this issue.\r\n \r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
