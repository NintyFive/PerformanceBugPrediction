This ambiguity is causing the problem.  \n\nWe have fixed this in 2.0 with #8872.  In the meantime, all I can suggest to you is to change either the type or the field name to remove the ambiguity\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/117313415","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11959#issuecomment-117313415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11959","id":117313415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzMxMzQxNQ==","user":{"login":"dariuskasiulevicius","id":1218606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg2MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1218606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dariuskasiulevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/dariuskasiulevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dariuskasiulevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dariuskasiulevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dariuskasiulevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dariuskasiulevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dariuskasiulevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dariuskasiulevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dariuskasiulevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dariuskasiulevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dariuskasiulevicius/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-30T19:27:04Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T19:27:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for quick response.
