This commit has what I have tried so far: https://github.com/davidbkemp/elasticsearch/commit/b3619c4707ca73ec9d15da18842f48b6fe9dcdab\r\n\r\nI think the existing range data type documentation is a little unconventional.  For most of the data types, the documentation seems to only include example mappings and documents.  They typically don't include queries.  I am beginning to feel that it should instead have links to example queries added to the documentation for the `term` and `range` queries.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/536373717","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27030#issuecomment-536373717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27030","id":536373717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjM3MzcxNw==","user":{"login":"Yang-Rongquan","id":39263868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjYzODY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/39263868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yang-Rongquan","html_url":"https://github.com/Yang-Rongquan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yang-Rongquan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yang-Rongquan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yang-Rongquan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yang-Rongquan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yang-Rongquan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yang-Rongquan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yang-Rongquan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yang-Rongquan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yang-Rongquan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-30T02:20:10Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T02:20:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There will be a big performance for range data type when query term and range filer.\r\nAnd I can't get feedback from elasticsearch support for several days.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
