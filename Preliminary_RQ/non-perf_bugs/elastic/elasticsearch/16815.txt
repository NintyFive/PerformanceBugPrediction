I am not sure if this is a feature or a bug, but we may want to discuss this. if you try to get node stats from a client node and other client nodes are part of the cluster, then the stats will only contain stats from this client node and all master and data nodes.\n\nThe reason for this is in `TransportNodesAction`, where we check, if the code where this is executed on is a client node as well as the receiving node, see [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/99a7d8e41f4a0dfa14f64d9b9d080626c558c5e3/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/support/nodes/TransportNodesAction.java#L161-L165)\n\nI understand that this is intentional in the TransportNodesAction, but there might be actions, where we actually want to allow this (clearing caches i.e.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
