I wonder why the translog is such a big offender if you don't fsync on every request. Just like lucene, it buffers stuff in memory and writes when the buffer is full. Also you can consider running with no replicas and turn them one when indexing is done. I'm going to close this now. We can continue discussing things on discuss.elastic.co . We can always reopen this if things change.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
