The problem is not the colon naming but rather that this is a virtual interface. `NetworkUtils.getAddressesForInterface` uses `NetworkInterface.getByName` of the JDK which returns null for virtual interfaces, even if the \"name\" is right. \n\nFor your case `NetworkInterface.getByName(\"bond0\").getSubInterfaces().nextElement();` would get you the right element. \n\nNow the thing is, its quite unpractical to split it up by colon itself and then match the subinterfaces name, but I think a compromise would be to just iterate over the result from `NetworkService .getInterfaces` and get the one where the name matches - because this includes all the physical and virtual interfaces (what the JDK refers to as sub interfaces).\n\nIf that makes sense I can get a PR up :)\n\n@jasontedor wdyt?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/234617125","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17473#issuecomment-234617125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17473","id":234617125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDYxNzEyNQ==","user":{"login":"daschl","id":29086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daschl","html_url":"https://github.com/daschl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daschl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daschl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daschl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daschl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daschl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daschl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daschl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daschl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daschl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-22T18:16:30Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T18:16:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll rework the test case and resubmit.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
