historically had used `event_type` to indicate the type for an event.\r\nThe decision has been made (#49634) to change this to `event.category` which is not just a simple name but also a slightly different structure, `event` being an object while `category` a sub-field.\r\nYet the request still uses `event_type_field` to allow overriding the event field.\r\n\r\nThe two need to be aligned, it's either `category` meaning `event_category_field` or `type` so there's `event.type` (instead of `event.category`).","closed_by":{"login":"aleksmaus","id":872351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjM1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/872351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus","html_url":"https://github.com/aleksmaus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleksmaus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
