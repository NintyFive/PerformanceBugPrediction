Create an index\r\n```\r\nPUT /myindex\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"properties\": {\r\n      \"d\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"date\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"q\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"percolator\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n 2. Index a couple of range queries that should be mutually exclisive\r\n```\r\n\r\nPUT /myindex/_doc/1\r\n{\r\n  \"q\": {\r\n    \"bool\": {\r\n      \"must\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"range\": {\r\n            \"d\": {\r\n              \"gt\": \"now\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nPUT /myindex/_doc/2\r\n{\r\n  \"q\": {\r\n    \"bool\": {\r\n      \"must\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"range\": {\r\n            \"d\": {\r\n              \"lt\": \"now\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n 3. Perform a constant-score percolate query\r\n```\r\nGET /myindex/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"constant_score\": {\r\n      \"filter\": {\r\n        \"percolate\": {\r\n          \"field\": \"q\",\r\n          \"document\": {\r\n            \"d\": \"2020-02-18T15:00:00.000+11:00\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected: Only one of the saved queries should match (document id \"2\").\r\n\r\nActual: Both of the saved queries match.\r\n\r\nNote that you do get the correct behaviour if you do not use `constant_score`.\r\ni.e. the following search gives the expected behaviour.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /myindex/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"percolate\": {\r\n      \"field\": \"q\",\r\n      \"document\": {\r\n        \"d\": \"2020-02-18T15:05:00.000+11:00\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"romseygeek","id":1347065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDcwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1347065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek","html_url":"https://github.com/romseygeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romseygeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
