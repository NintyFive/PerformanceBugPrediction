If the [token is a string](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/bucket/range/RangeAggregator.java#L155), we check if it is potentially a `key`.  If the token is a numeric value, we don't check for a `key` and [thus throw the error](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/bucket/range/RangeAggregator.java#L148).\r\n\r\nIt would be fairly trivial to cast a numeric `key` into a string and use that.\r\n\r\nNote: We'll still need to return the key as a string, because default keys include the range (`*-100`), as well as BWC reasons.
