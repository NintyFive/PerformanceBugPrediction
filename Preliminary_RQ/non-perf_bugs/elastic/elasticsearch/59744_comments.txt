I would make sure that there is no instabilities there.\r\n\r\nThat said this is not the place to track this kind of thing down I'm afraid as this appears to be a user question, and we'd like to direct these kinds of things to the [Elasticsearch forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch). If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
