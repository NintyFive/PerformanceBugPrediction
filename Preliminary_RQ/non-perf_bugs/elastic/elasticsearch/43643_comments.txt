I notice that you are using elasticsearch version 6.7.2, but using the \"current\" documentation, which is currently for version 7.2. Version 6.7 does not support the new typeless endpoint for the `_update` API. See [6.7 documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.7/docs-update.html) for the correct examples for your version. I would recommend to always ensure that the documentation consulted is for the specific version in use.\r\n\r\nGiven that this works as intended and the docs look correct, I am closing this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
