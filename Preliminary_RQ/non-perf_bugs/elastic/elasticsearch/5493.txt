The upshot is JNA extracts out the relevant native library to /tmp and trys to load it, however if you follow security best practice and disable execute in /tmp (noexec mount option), this fails silently. The JNA documentation recommends you extract out the libraries on systems with additional security constraints; in fact the JNA package that ships with RHEL puts the relevant library in /usr/lib64/jna.\n\nI see two potential solutions:\n- src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/jna/CLibrary.java - log with warning on UnsatisfiedLinkError (rather than debug), and hint at noexec being a potential issue\n- extract out the various libjnidispatch.so versions into the elasticsearch lib directory and get JNA to load from there\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
