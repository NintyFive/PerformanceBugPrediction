I indexed all of them to elasticsearch using fscrawler. But now I have an issue with authorization of those files which will be accessed from elasticsearch. I want to integrate my active directory and wants the existing users roles to be applied. I found a way with Xpack. But their roles privileges in AD will get applied with xpack when they search for a file or folder in elasticsearch?\r\n\r\nPlease someone help me out with this.
