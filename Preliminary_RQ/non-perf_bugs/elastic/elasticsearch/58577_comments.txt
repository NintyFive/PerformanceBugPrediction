This is a known [issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9022) that we fixed in Lucene 8.3. Parent join queries should never be cached because they hold a lot of pre-aggregated informations that are not accounted in the cache. You should upgrade to a most recent 7.x version (latest is `7.8.0` and the first version that contains the fix is `7.5`) so I hope you don't mind if I close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
