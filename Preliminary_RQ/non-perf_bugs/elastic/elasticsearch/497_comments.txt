On one side, i like it, on the other I don't :)  Elasticsearch aims to be easy to use, but still flexible and powerful enough to be really awesome.  There is a continuum between configurability and ease of use. And assumptions that we impose in order to be easy to use can limit the amount of flexibility we can provide.\n\nWe don't want to be Lucene-level configurable, because that is too low level. On the other hand, we don't want to be like those photo-editing apps that you used to get with digital cameras.  You know, the ones with the big buttons for idiots.\n\nYou opened this issue two years ago and since then, I think ES has chosen its level.  Your suggestions are great, but are things that can be implemented easily in an application on top of ES, which I think is the right place for them now.\n\nI'm trying to clear out old tickets that are no longer relevant, and my temptation is to keep this one open. But honestly, I don't think it'll ever be implemented, so I'm closing it :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
