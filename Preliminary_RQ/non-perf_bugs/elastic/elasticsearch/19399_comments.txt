like to clarify the issue before delving deeper. It seems that we want to add links to the `scroll` helpers for each supported languages to the [Scroll API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-scroll) section in the Elasticsearch reference. For example, adding a link to the [Search Scroll API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high-search-scroll.html#) for Java.\r\n\r\n@debadair, is that determination correct?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/625259314","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19399#issuecomment-625259314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19399","id":625259314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTI1OTMxNA==","user":{"login":"Mpdreamz","id":245275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTI3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/245275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz","html_url":"https://github.com/Mpdreamz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mpdreamz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-07T13:34:52Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T13:34:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey @lockewritesdocs I don't think there is anything actionable left here.\r\n\r\nWe recently coordinated on making sure all helpers that exist are documented:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/clients-team/issues/129\r\n\r\nAnd opened PR's for these e.g: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/51388\r\n\r\nThe linked Scroll API is not a helper but a 1-1 mapping of the API.
