There's an effort that started to [bundle `metricbeat` in ES to replace monitoring](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49399) so that could be similar. That would make the indexing and progress completely asynchronous and less prone to memory explosion in case there's a lot of write/search activities on the cluster ?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/694744897","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62077#issuecomment-694744897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62077","id":694744897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NDc0NDg5Nw==","user":{"login":"pgomulka","id":11137008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTM3MDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11137008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka","html_url":"https://github.com/pgomulka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-18T08:53:56Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T08:53:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"we discussed this on core infra sync 16th sep\r\nthe concussion is that we don't want index slow logs with the same mechanism we use for deprecation logs because this would cause a performance problem.\r\nIf slow logs are to be indexed, they should be indexed with an external process (like filebeat) ideally to a separate monitoring cluster.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
