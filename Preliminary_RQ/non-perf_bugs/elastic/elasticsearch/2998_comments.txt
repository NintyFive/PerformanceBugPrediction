But, typically, node level (indices) level throttling is the one that makes sense, which is set using the `indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec`, which you can change using the cluster update settings API (cause it changes the setting on teh cluster level).\n\nIf you open and close the index, then yes, the index level setting will then take affect. We should log a warning in that case when the index level setting is changed, and the index was created with throttling on the node (indices) level.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/17503687","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2998#issuecomment-17503687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2998","id":17503687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTAzNjg3","user":{"login":"jgagnon1","id":568924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODkyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/568924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgagnon1","html_url":"https://github.com/jgagnon1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgagnon1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgagnon1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgagnon1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgagnon1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgagnon1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgagnon1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgagnon1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgagnon1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgagnon1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-06T19:49:41Z","updated_at":"2013-05-06T19:49:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Let say I am bulk reindexing a index on a live cluster and I don't want the indexation to take all the IO...
