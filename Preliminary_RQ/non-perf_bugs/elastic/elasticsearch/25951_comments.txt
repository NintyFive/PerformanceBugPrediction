We've got other reports of issues caused by the max retry timeout, and the more I looked into it the more I realized that this timeout mechanism did not play well with the internals of the underlying http client that we rely on. I think it's better to rely on the different timeouts exposed by the http client directly and remove this additional mechanism that ends up causing more harm than good. We have deprecated max retry timeout in 6.x, as well as increased its default value to 90 seconds (#38425) and removed it in 7.0 (#38085).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
