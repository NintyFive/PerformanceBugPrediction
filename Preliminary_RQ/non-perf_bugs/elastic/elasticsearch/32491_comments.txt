This used to happen a fair bit when folks when try to embed Elasticsearch inside another Java application. That isn't supported and will caused stuff like this. Beyond that it is hard to tell what is up.\r\n\r\nSince this is *probably* not a bug in Elasticsearch I'm going to close this. If you want help deploying Elasticsearch please head to https://discuss.elastic.co . If you think this is genuinely a bug please provide steps for exactly how you deployed Elasticsearch and reopen the issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
