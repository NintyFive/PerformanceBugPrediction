You can find my plugin here:\n\nhttps://github.com/Asquera/elasticsearch-http-basic\n\nMy two cents on SSL: Supporting SSL does not only mean implementing all the nuts and bolts (certificate management, etc.), it also has to be efficient and safe. There are other projects (stunnel, nginx, your favourite hardware load balancer) that are much better at doing all that. If you want your elasticsearch to speak ssl externally without configuring nginx - bind it to a local port and put stunnel in front of it.
