Therefore when we think about cat API functionality we tend towards implementing them in a way that makes them comfortable to use with traditional line-oriented command line tools. We do not want to take on the weight of maintaining features that are orthogonal to our intended use of the cat APIs. Regarding sharing relevant URL with the grep info, you can do this by sharing a relevant command line instead (\"`curl | grep`\").\r\n\r\nWe do however think there is a place in cat APIs for adding filtering/searching functionality that is specific to Elasticsearch (e.g., we will do wildcard expansion on `/_cat/indices` because how we do that is specific to Elasticsearch and we have the code in our codebase to do this). If there are APIs where we are missing this we are open to specifically targeted feature requests for them. As far as adding general grep functionality we are not going to do that.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
