If primary data support was not intended, then why have support for arbitrarily complex data?  A comma separated list of data items would be much simpler to handle.  But, if complex objects can be injested, why can't that complexity be used in the indexing?\n\nI lean heavily toward using the database as a primary repository.  The customer has complex data and does not want to have to mangle/unmangle that data every time they touch it, just to simplify the job of the indexer.  The code I am submitting supports that.  Customers can provide complex data and get that complex data back unmodified, but the indexer gets access to more than simple atomic data.\n\nI have a philosophical problem with the processing of data not being centralized.  The injest nodes plan assumes voluntary compliance by the client software submitting data.  Any plan to mangle data externally to the database has the potential to support multiple paths to the database and the potential for inconsistent processing of the data.  I feel strongly that such processing needs to be centralized and the simplest center for that processing is the database.
