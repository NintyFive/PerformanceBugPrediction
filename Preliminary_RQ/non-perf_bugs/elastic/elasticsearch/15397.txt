Here is the steps to reproduce the problem:\n1) Created the index:\n\n{ \"settings\": { \"similarity\": { \"LMSimilarity\": { \"type\": \"LMDirichlet\", \"mu\": 2500 } } }, \"mappings\": { \"item\": { \"properties\": { \"title\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"similarity\": \"LMSimilarity\" } } } } }\n\n2) Indexed two documents:\n\n{\"title\":\"This is a test for search similarity when we search by other search options.\"}\n{\"title”:”Search looks weird when use other search possibilities. Numbers are not clear. Just adding new stuff to make the document longer. Document norm looks weird.\"}\n\n3) Run a simple query:\n\n{ \"explain\": \"true\", \"query\": { \"match\": { \"title\": \"search\" } } }\n\nIf you look at the returned scores, there are multiple weird numbers:\n1) The score for all documents is zero\n2) The collection probability, a term property that is independent from individual documents, is different for each document. I expect this number to be the same for all documents for a given term.\n3) Document norm has a negative value, probably it's the log of another number, but I can't match these numbers to the LM formula.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
