If you index a document with `{ \"ts\" : \"1000-01-01T00:00:00Z\" }` you also get the same negative sort value as in your example. If you specify `\"format\" : \"epoch_millis\"` in your mappings for the date field everything works as expected for me.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/253204319","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20865#issuecomment-253204319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20865","id":253204319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzIwNDMxOQ==","user":{"login":"chaudum","id":281260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTI2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/281260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaudum","html_url":"https://github.com/chaudum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaudum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaudum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaudum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaudum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaudum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaudum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaudum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaudum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaudum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T12:50:23Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T12:50:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks for clarification @cbuescher !\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
