Query on a multi-field field. (Hard to explain, see the gist)\n\n**Steps to reproduce**: I made a simple gist: https://gist.github.com/ebuildy/72fade2e26dea91256d6\n1. Create an index, with a multi-field field (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_multi_fields.html)\n2. Add a document with a single field\n3. Query against a field that is the index type name (in my GIST: \"title\", I query against title.simple)\n4. The document is matched but does not contain any field \"title\"\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n\nExplains debug shows \"weight(alias.simple:coca in 0)\" whereas I specify the field \"title\" in the query.\n\nIt seems fixed from 2.0, but I am curious to know the reason!\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
