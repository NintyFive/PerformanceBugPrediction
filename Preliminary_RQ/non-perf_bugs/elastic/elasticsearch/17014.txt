When dfs is set to true, I get a null_pointer_description (demonstrated below). However, if I set dfs to false, I get term vectors. I'd really like to set dfs to true because I'd like to get term statistics for the entire index.\n\n``` javascript\n{  \n    \"ids\" : [\"AVM0c1e8FqhBZ7YfiHM8\"],\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"fields\": [\"LongDescription\"],\n        \"term_statistics\": true,\n        \"field_statistics\": true,\n        \"dfs\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe response I'm getting is:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  \"docs\": [\n    {\n      \"_index\": \"my_index\",\n      \"_type\": \"my_type\",\n      \"_id\": \"AVM0c1e8FqhBZ7YfiHM8\",\n      \"error\": {\n        \"root_cause\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"exception\",\n            \"reason\": \"failed to execute term vector request\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"exception\",\n        \"reason\": \"failed to execute term vector request\",\n        \"caused_by\": {\n          \"type\": \"null_pointer_exception\",\n          \"reason\": null\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n\nThe original question, along with relevant logs, can be found [here](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/getting-a-null-pointer-exception-when-executing-a-distributed-multi-term-vector-query/43606/3).\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
