It's such an exceptional situation that we should require human interaction? I mean we can maybe throw a better exception but messing with it seems dangerous?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/276437076","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19036#issuecomment-276437076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19036","id":276437076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjQzNzA3Ng==","user":{"login":"benavid","id":7650278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTAyNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7650278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benavid","html_url":"https://github.com/benavid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benavid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benavid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benavid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benavid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benavid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benavid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benavid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benavid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benavid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T17:45:51Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T17:45:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Do you know if this issue continue happens with elasticseach 2.4.1?, when I try to start elasticsearch I receive this error: Starting elasticsearch: Exception in thread \"main\" java.nio.file.FileAlreadyExistsException: /data/elasticsearch/marta/nodes/0/__es__.tmp\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
