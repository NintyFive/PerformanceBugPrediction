If the end-user has their umask wrong, we could expose permissions on directories that we don't want to exposed. While a valid claim can be made that it is the end-users responsibility, and that going against the umask possibly violates the principle of least astonishment, I would rather us choose the more secure option here. Thus, I favor option 3.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/211593056","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17634#issuecomment-211593056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17634","id":211593056,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTU5MzA1Ng==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-18T21:35:44Z","updated_at":"2016-04-18T21:35:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think that we should set the permissions to what we think they should be rather than relying on the end-user umask.\n\nI think we should set the permissions to what we think they should be. To me the experience with the deb and rpm is paramount - all the permissions should \"just work\". 644, root owned, whatever. Just set the permissions to what we think they should be. If the user doesn't like them I expect they'll change them with puppet/chef/ansible/bash scripts/duct tape/bubblegum.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
