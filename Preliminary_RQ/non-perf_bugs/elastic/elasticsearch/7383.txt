Debian/Ubuntu there is a nice package \"java-package\" which automatically builds JDK/JRE packages for Oracle Java 6/7 and perhaps already version 8 in testing release... \n\nTherefore it would be nice to add in this line of elasticsearch/src/deb/init.d/elasticsearch:\n\n```\n# The first existing directory is used for JAVA_HOME (if JAVA_HOME is not defined in $DEFAULT)\nJDK_DIRS=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/ /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-armhf /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/ /usr/lib/jvm/default-java\"\n```\n\nalso this path:\n\n```\n /usr/lib/jvm/j2sdk1.7-oracle\n```\n\nBTW: \nWould be nice to get  also a check for existing java binary with correct version in the init script (and perhaps already as package dependencies ?) so that the init script do more then starting as \"OK\" without doing anything ;) ... \n\nThanks\n\nEDIT: sorry, dependencies are not good ... in Saltstack/puppet templates java ist often installed directly from tar files ... so better as Recommend packages if it should be setup in a .deb package.\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
