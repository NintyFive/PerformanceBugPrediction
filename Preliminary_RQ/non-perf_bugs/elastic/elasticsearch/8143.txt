I propose to remove them:\n### `_type: { index: no }`\n\nNot indexing the `_type` sounds appealing since documentation mentions everything will keep on working, so that should just save space. Except that elasticsearch will internally run a prefix query on the `_uid` field instead, which is going to be super slow. I think we should remove this option.\n### `_type: { store: yes }` and `_id: { store: yes }`\n\nStoring the type and _id is useless since we already enforce the _uid to be stored, and the _uid contains these informations.\n### `_id: { index: not_analyzed }`\n\nThe `_id` field is the same for all documents so we should not need to index, store or doc-value it. (Can be done now thanks to https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/6073 and https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/7965)\n\nIn general I'm wondering if we shouldn't go further and completely lock down how data is indexed/stored/docvalued for meta fields. There would just remain high-level configuration options such as `enabled` on the `_timestamp` mapper or `type` on `_parent`.\n\nRelates to #8870\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
