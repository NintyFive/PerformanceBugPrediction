For example `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT languages) FROM test_emp WHERE languages > 100` returns `NULL`, whereas it should return `0` since there are no documents matching the condition `languages > 100`.","closed_by":{"login":"astefan","id":893749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/893749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan","html_url":"https://github.com/astefan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
