I'm fully aware that this has been deprecated and refers to `copy_to`. But I'm not seeing how this would help me in this situation and so far I haven't come across a solution to my problem (documentation, Google Search, etc.).\n\nConclusion: Why does it return a result? What do I need to change in order to only get a result when the full path is specified? \n\nTested with ES 1.2.2 (which we currently use in production) and ES 1.3.1. One node setup. Default configuration. (OS X 10.9.2, Java 1.7.0_60)\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
