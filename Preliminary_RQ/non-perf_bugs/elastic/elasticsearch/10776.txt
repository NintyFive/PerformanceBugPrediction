When constructing the actual lucene query this is used to store the resulting named query in the QueryParseContext. We should try to think about a more generic way to handle this for all queries.\n\nFrom the 37 queries currently implementing QueryBuilder only 7 don't support having a \"queryName\":\n- BoostingQB\n- ConstantScoreQB\n- FunctionScoreQB\n- MatchAllQB\n- SpanMultiTermQB\n- TemplateQB\n- WrapperQB\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
