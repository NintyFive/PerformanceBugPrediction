`SUM(IF(KPI='1',Number_Value,0))` is not currently supported in ES-SQL and it's not on our near roadmap.\r\n\r\nRegarding the `no viable alternative at input` error you get, this is because you need to escape those characters with double quotes: `select sum(Number_Value) - 1 as \"件数\" from operator_warehouse_data where KPI='件数'`.\r\n\r\nAlso, while we appreciate the feedback provided in this issue, github is reserved for confirmed bugs or enhancement requests and your questions would have been better handled in our [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/).
