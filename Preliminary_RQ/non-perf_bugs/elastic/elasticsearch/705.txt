For example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"match_all\" : {  }\n    },\n    \"facets\" : {\n        \"tag_price_stats\" : {\n            \"terms_stats\" : {\n                \"key_field\" : \"tag\",\n                \"value_field\" : \"price\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `size` parameter controls how many facet entries will be returned. It defaults to `10`. Setting it to `0` will return all terms matching the hits.\n\nOrdering is done by setting `order`, with possible values of `term`, `reverse_term`, `count`, `reverse_count`, `total`, `reverse_total`, `min`, `reverse_min`, `max`, `reverse_max`. Defaults to `term`.\n\nThe value computed can also be a script, using the `value_script` provided, in which case the `lang` can control its language, and `params` allow to provide custom parameters (as in other scripted components).\n\n_Note_: It is expected that the will be a single value of the key field per doc, and one or multiple values of the value field.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
