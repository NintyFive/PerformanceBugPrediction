This means the master acts as a coordinating node for this. At the moment the indices stats calls translate to one request per _shard_ (see #7990) which results in some load on the master and the receiving nodes.  That said, marvel does the call, waits for it to complete, sleeps for 10s (default) and does it again. Even with 700 indices (7000 shards, assuming defaults) the load should be low. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68995059","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9130#issuecomment-68995059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9130","id":68995059,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4OTk1MDU5","user":{"login":"mosiddi","id":2240862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDA4NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2240862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosiddi","html_url":"https://github.com/mosiddi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosiddi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosiddi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosiddi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosiddi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosiddi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosiddi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosiddi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosiddi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosiddi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-07T09:05:13Z","updated_at":"2015-01-07T09:05:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @bleskes ...
