I tried the experimental highlighter and it had the same behavior as fvh (ignoring stopwords in phrase searches, and therefore missing matches where the stopword is in the middle-- e.g. \"motion to adjourn\"). I also noticed that the experimental highlighter doesn't support whole-field fragments (number_of_fragments = 0).\n**However**, your comment solved my problem. Indeed, it looks like the Wikipedia search matches phrases because it uses a whitespace-like analyzer. So, I took out the stopwords from my English analyzer, reindexed, and now I've got phrase highlighting with stopwords. Would still be nice to have the option to match stopwords with the highlighter only, but this works for now.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/258666812","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2157#issuecomment-258666812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2157","id":258666812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODY2NjgxMg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-06T09:22:24Z","updated_at":"2016-11-06T09:22:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated for 5.0.
