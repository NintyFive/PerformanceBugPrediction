It would be good to bind API requests to some value specified on the client side. For example:\n\nclient.prepareSearch().setRequestId(\"SOME_STRING\").execute().actionGet();\n\nWhat I would like to achieve is an ability to group logs from various system components.\n\nAssuming that we have a system containing 3 components:\n- A - HTTP frontend\n- B - My App \n- C - Elasticsearch\n\nand communication chain is as follows:\n\nCLIENT -> A (generation of unique request id happens here) -> B (with given request id) -> C (with given request id)\n\nNow if there is an exception or warning logged in one of those systems it will be logged with request id bound to the request. So assuming that we have centralized logging infrastructure it would be very easy to track the root causes and side effects of problems that occur in the system.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
