solution is to find single bucket value aggs in AggregationToJsonProcessor and handle them as if they were leaf node aggregations.\r\n\r\nI do not think that is necessarily correct.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"aggregations\" : {\r\n        \"buckets\" : {\r\n          \"date_histogram\" : {\r\n            \"field\" : \"timestamp\",\r\n            \"time_zone\" : \"UTC\",\r\n            \"interval\" : \"15m\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"aggregations\" : {\r\n            \"timestamp\" : {\r\n              \"max\" : {\r\n                \"field\" : \"timestamp\"\r\n              }\r\n            },\r\n            \"ITBuckets\" : {\r\n              \"filter\": {\r\n                    \"term\": {\r\n                      \"DestCountry\": \"IT\"\r\n                    }\r\n                  },\r\n                  \"aggs\": {\r\n                    \"sourceFlights\": {\r\n                      \"terms\": {\r\n                        \"field\": \"OriginCountry\"\r\n                      },\r\n                      \"aggs\": {\r\n                        \"avgFlightMinutes\": {\r\n                          \"avg\": {\r\n                            \"field\": \"FlightTimeMin\"\r\n                          }\r\n                        }\r\n                      }\r\n                    }\r\n                  }\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd having the job do analysis on `avgFlightMinutes`.\r\n\r\nIf we do not restrict the number of single bucket aggs that can be on the same level, it is conceivable that two \"sister\" aggs both have a multi-bucket sub aggregation.\r\n\r\nSo, I think we should restrict either: \r\n* How many single bucket aggs are allowed at a level\r\n* Restrict what sub-aggregations are allowed for single bucket aggs\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @davidkyle
