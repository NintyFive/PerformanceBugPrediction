They are created in a file-system repository on a Windows Server 2012 shared folder. The snapshots are created successfully and I can successfully restore data from them, and _some_ can be successfully deleted.\n\nHowever, when I try to some particular snapshots, ES return a 500 status code and only this info:\n`{\"error\":\"NullPointerException[null]\",\"status\":500}`\nSince there is no stacktrace and no other info (I checked ES node logs of the cluster), I have no idea how to fix it.\n\nThis is on ES 1.7.3.\n\nI don't think it is permissions issues since only some of the snapshots fail to be deleted.
