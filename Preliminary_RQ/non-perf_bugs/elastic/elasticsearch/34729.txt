See `Hasher.resolveFromHash`\r\n- Add tests for this\r\n- Add it to the API documentation\r\n\r\nThe use cases for using hashed passwords in the API are:\r\n- replicating users (and passwords) from other stores (or other clusters) that support compatible hashing schemes. \r\n- improved security in automation tools (e.g. ansible) - the automation scripts can store a hashed password rather than a clear text one\r\n- extreme end-to-end security in user setup (ES never sees the clear text password)\r\n- efficiency in [bulk user setup](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33845). Password hashing is one of the slowest parts of user creation. This can offload that work to the client.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
