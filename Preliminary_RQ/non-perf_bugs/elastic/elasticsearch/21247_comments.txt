This should be simpler to implement and easier for users to manage.  It is a better alternative to building many similar pipelines via copy/paste.  Hopefully this feature would also be more efficient than running smaller pipelines serially.   Composable pipelines are more likely to allow for complicated designs that are difficult to troubleshoot and could result in pipeline cycles through nesting or recursion.
