It's easy enough to maintain Java and ES version consistency within the cluster, but it's not so easy to do so between the cluster and client applications. Especially if you want to support operations like HA rolls. Using a JSON/REST client is much more permissive of variation between the client and server configurations.\n\nOn the other hand, the Java JSON client offerings have some pretty serious shortcomings of their own, mostly around having weird interfaces, but bugs are also a substantial challenge. \n\nIdeally, we would write all our code against the ES Client interface and then simply wire in an HttpTransportClient (e.g.). This would give the flexibility to experiment with the tradeoffs when using a Node client vs. a Transport client vs. Http. From a usablility perspective also, it seems preferable to reuse the same interfaces that ES already provides, documents, and maintains.\n\nI've looked into the code, and it doesn't look like it would be too hairy, but I'd be surprised if you all hadn't thought about this problem at least once before.\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts before I get too deep into an implementation.\nAlso, I'd like to know if you'd have any interest in maintaining the library; specifically if you'd want it in the ES codebase or not. I can develop this in a separate repo, but if you think you'd ultimately want it, I should fork ES and send you a PR.\n\nThanks,\n-John\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
