I've only observed this with script files (i.e. under config/scripts).\n\nMy current workaround involves adding arbitrary comments and white space to the script until its content hash starts with a word character. An easy fix would be simply to prepend a valid character (`_` or whatever) to the `fake` class name.\n\nCheers,\nRichard\n","closed_by":{"login":"richardhundt","id":151847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/151847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardhundt","html_url":"https://github.com/richardhundt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardhundt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardhundt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardhundt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardhundt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardhundt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardhundt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardhundt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardhundt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardhundt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
