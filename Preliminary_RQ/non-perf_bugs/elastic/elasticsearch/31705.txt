The passed in script is ____ characters.  Consider using a plugin if a script longer than this length is a requirement.`\r\n\r\nApparently this cap is hard-coded as a constant in the compiler code. I understand the advice for keeping scripts short, they are not designed to be abused. However, there are cases where writing a plugin may not be an option or may not be desirable. Writing a Java plugin is more involved and, for example, AWS Elasticsearch doesn't support non pre-installed plugins.\r\n\r\nIt happens that I have fallen into this narrow case where I do need to write a long Painless script, and I'm having to use hackish tricks to keep it under the limit. Having a hard cap, although understandable, seems a bit arbitrary.\r\n\r\nI would like to open a discussion about this issue and ask that it is at least set as a configuration option if serious internal conflicts don't come up in the discussion. I would also appreciate to hear some arguments against using long Painless (update) scripts, to make sure I'm not doing a serious mistake.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
