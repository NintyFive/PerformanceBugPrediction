The same query format works in version 5.6.8 and was noticed after an upgrade. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nHere are the steps (using Kibana) to set up an index to reproduce the issue \r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT test_query\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"test_type\": {\r\n      \"_source\": {\r\n        \"enabled\": true\r\n      },\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n          \"my_field\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"text\",\r\n            \"analyzer\": \"standard\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nPOST /test_query/test_type\r\n{\r\n  \"my_field\": \"Test Value Here\"\r\n}\r\nPOST /test_query/test_type\r\n{\r\n  \"my_field\": \"Testing different\"\r\n}\r\nPOST test_query/_refresh\r\nGET test_query/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"simple_query_string\": {\r\n      \"fields\": [\r\n        \"my_field\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"query\": \"Test*\",\r\n      \"default_operator\": \"and\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nGET test_query/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"simple_query_string\": {\r\n      \"fields\": [\r\n        \"my_field\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"query\": \"Test *\",\r\n      \"default_operator\": \"and\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe query \"Test*\" returns the document as expected. However \"Test *\" does not work in version 6.2.4. In version 5.6.8, both queries return results as expected using the same standard analyzer for the field. \r\n\r\nExpected 1 hit, actually received 0 hits.\r\n\r\nWas there an intentional change made that would impact this query in version 6.X?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
