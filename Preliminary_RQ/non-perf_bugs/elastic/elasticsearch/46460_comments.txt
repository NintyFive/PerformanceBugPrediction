Looking at the example, I think the text on point 4 is meant to cover all remaining callouts. Putting it on each field again would create unnecessary repetition. Having said that, the example has been already reworked in the [7.0 documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/mapping.html#_example_mapping), so I'm leaning towards leaving it like it is on 6.8. Happy to accept a PR though if you think its clearer the way it is in 7.0, just adapt the 6.8 example accordingly and open a PR.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/535001695","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46460#issuecomment-535001695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46460","id":535001695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTAwMTY5NQ==","user":{"login":"stiltz","id":16760856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzYwODU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/16760856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stiltz","html_url":"https://github.com/stiltz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stiltz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stiltz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stiltz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stiltz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stiltz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stiltz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stiltz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stiltz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stiltz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-25T12:38:09Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T12:38:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cbuescher I opened [PR 47109](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/47109) to update the docs.
