The user causes this but putting a warning in logs will not inform the user that something is not right with the request, and even if it did, in many cases the user indexing the document will not have access to the log files. Also, if someone indexes a bulk load of document with extra dimensions they are going to create massive amounts of logs without any knowledge that there is any warnings. Throwing an exception gives the user feedback saying that something is not right. We need a solution here that is obvious to the user. Maybe something like having an option in the mapping to either throw an error on extra dimensions or to ignore them?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/94499435","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9540#issuecomment-94499435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9540","id":94499435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0NDk5NDM1","user":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-20T16:24:02Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T16:24:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed in #10539 by silently ignoring values beyond the 2nd dimension.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
