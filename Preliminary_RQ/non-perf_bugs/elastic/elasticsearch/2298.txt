There's a synonyms file with just this line:\n\n```\ntest => Some Thing Here, Another Item\n```\n\nAnd a query like so:\n\n```\n{\n  \"fields\" : [ \"name\" ],\n  \"query\" : {\n    \"query_string\" : \n    {\n      \"query\" : \"test\",\n      \"analyzer\" : \"sb_analyzer\",\n      \"fields\" : [ \"name\" ],\n      \"auto_generate_phrase_queries\" : true\n    }\n  },\n  \"sort\" : [\n    {\n      \"localDateTime\" : { \"order\" : \"asc\" }\n    }\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nThe problem I'm having is that because the replacements have a different number of words (3 and 2, respectively), it will only return the items that match the term with the most words, \"Some Thing Here\" in this case, but if I have a synonym like this:\n\n```\ntest => Some Thing Here, Another Item There\n```\n\nIt will work as I expect, returning items that the terms \"Some Thing Here\", or \"Another Item There\". I'm not sure if I'm missing something or if there's some limitation/bug in ElasticSearch regarding synonyms with differing # of words in their replacements.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
