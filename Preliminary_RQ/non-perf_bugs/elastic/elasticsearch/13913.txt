Most of those I'd like to delete, but 10 are useful and should be kept. I have to delete ~1500 snapshots. At 30 minutes each, that will take about 25 days.\n\nIf there were a way to copy snapshots between repositories, this would be a much faster operation: copy those 10 snapshots, delete the old repository.\n\nAny plans to support this? I think it would reduce the pain of cleaning up large repositories substantially.\n","closed_by":{"login":"MorrieAtElastic","id":28967808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTY3ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/28967808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MorrieAtElastic","html_url":"https://github.com/MorrieAtElastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MorrieAtElastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MorrieAtElastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MorrieAtElastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MorrieAtElastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MorrieAtElastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MorrieAtElastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MorrieAtElastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MorrieAtElastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MorrieAtElastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
