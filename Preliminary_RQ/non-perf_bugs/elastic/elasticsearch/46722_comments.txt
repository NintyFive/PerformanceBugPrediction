This means that the phrase query will match documents that contain `strip` and `html` only if they are one positions apart (one term must appear between them). As such I hope you don't mind that I close this issue, please open a discussion in our [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) if you have further questions since we reserve github for verified bugs and feature request.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
