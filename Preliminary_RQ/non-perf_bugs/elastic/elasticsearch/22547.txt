This worked fine before the new year, but then I noticed entries appearing with a one year old timestamp.\r\nTurns out, the date processor was parsing the date string \"Jan 2 23:59:48\" as \"2016-01-02T23:59:48.000Z\". Restarting elasticsearch caused new entries to get the correct year information.\r\n\r\nMore info available [here](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/filebeat-syslog-module-problem-on-year-change/71114).\r\nPossibly related to [logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-date#3](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-date/issues/3)","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
