Now, each filter can accept a `_name` in its top level definition, for example: \n\n```\n{\n    \"filtered\" : {\n        \"query\" : {\n            \"term\" : { \"name.first\" : \"shay\" }\n        },\n        \"filter\" : {\n            \"terms\" : {\n                \"name.last\" : [\"banon\", \"kimchy\"],\n                \"_name\" : \"test\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe search response will include for each hit the `matched_filters` it matched on.\n\nNote, the query filter had to be enhanced in order to support this. In order to set a name, the `fquery` filter should be used, which wraps a `query` (just so there will be a place to set a name for it), for example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"filtered\" : {\n        \"query\" : {\n            \"term\" : { \"name.first\" : \"shay\" }\n        },\n        \"filter\" : {\n            \"fquery\" : {\n                \"query\" : {\n                    \"term\" : { \"name.last\" : \"banon\" }\n                },\n                \"_name\" : \"test\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
