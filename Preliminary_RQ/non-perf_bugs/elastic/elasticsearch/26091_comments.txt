However, Elastic reserves GitHub for bug reports and feature requests but provides a [Discourse forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) and [IRC channels](https://www.elastic.co/community) for general questions like this. I'd like to ask you to raise this question there again and will close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
