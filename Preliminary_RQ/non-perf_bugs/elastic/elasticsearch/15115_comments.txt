However we already support that, it works fine when indexing document with completion type field in String format.\r\n```\r\ncurl --request PUT \\\r\n  --url http://localhost:9200/subfieldcompletion2/citytype/12 \\\r\n  --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\r\n  --data '\r\n{\r\n  \"city\"  : \"New York\"\r\n}'\r\n```\r\nIt is possible to fix that by modifying the CompletionFieldMapper to provide multiFields mapper with a context with already parsed externalValue. Also The CompletionFieldMapper itself, should support externalValues from context (it is not at the moment)\r\nWill create a PR with a fix instead of validation shortly.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
