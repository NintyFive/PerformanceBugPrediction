When we set up those query builder tests we randomly assign the `_name` field to a query. In rare cases we might accidentally pick the same name for subqueries and the main query under test, like in this case:\n\n```\n{\n  \"boosting\" : {\n    \"positive\" : { },\n    \"negative\" : {\n      \"term\" : {\n        \"mapped_boolean\" : {\n          \"value\" : false,\n          \"boost\" : 0.1,\n          \"_name\" : \"q\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"negative_boost\" : 0.6666667,\n    \"boost\" : 1.0,\n    \"_name\" : \"q\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen storing the queries by name in the shard context namedQueries map, this can lead to conflicts. Will change the test setup so this cannot happen any longer.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
