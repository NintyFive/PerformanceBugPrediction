I've increased the logging levels to TRACE for the test:\r\nmaster: 68f03b88c495fd1e408c1aff559e8551004d64b4\r\n5.x: 9f0368e0de4ad30ee1dc3492afa9a38e8a3b3a65\r\n5.4: 6ea51f4184dcdf9632fe3e0a53944ffeac2016b7\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the restore operation times out: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/snapshots/SharedClusterSnapshotRestoreIT.java#L852\r\n\r\nThis happens because the restore operation is never removed from the cluster state, which the `RestoreService` takes care of in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/snapshots/RestoreService.java#L679\r\n\r\nIn order for the `RestoreService` to clear up the restore operation from the cluster state, it needs to be triggered by updating the restore shards to the FAILED state, which happens in `RestoreInProgressUpdater`, but it does not update the `failedShards` set for some reason.\r\n\r\nI've increased the logging in the `o.e.cluster.routing` package and the `o.e.snapshots` package for this test to hopefully get more info the next time it fails.
