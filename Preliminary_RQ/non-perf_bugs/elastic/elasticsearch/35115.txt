TokenService attempts to inform the caller whether a token invalidation was \"created\". `\"created\":true` is intended to imply that the token was previously valid but is now invalid. `false` indicates that token was already invalid.\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't work, and the API already returns `true`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v6.4.2/x-pack/plugin/security/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/security/authc/TokenService.java#L589-L600\r\n\r\nThere's 2 issues:\r\n- The UpdateRequest never requests the source, so `updateResponse.getGetResult()` is always `null`.\r\n- Even if we did, the `GetResult` is the _updated_ source, not the original source, so `invalidated` will always be `true` (because we just set it).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jkakavas","id":10281256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgxMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10281256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas","html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
