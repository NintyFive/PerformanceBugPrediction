Not only because it would be useful from upgrade assistant, but to also make it easier to upgrade for users who don't use kibana (I think there was a question about this during last stack-upgrade sync)\r\nAs suggested here to either wrap deprecation logs within `/_migration/deprecations` or refactor current `DeprecationInfoAction` so that deprecation issues could be accessed the same way as deprecation logs.\r\n\r\nDeprecation info checks are using cluster, node and index settings and have to be triggered 'on demand' - that means we won't be able to avoid that call from upgrade assistant (or someone doing this from console). Because of this I appears to me that the first suggested option (wrapping logs as a result form `/_migration/deprecation/') would be more preferable.

Also with the data stream and the new indexing strategy a 'write` endpoint is also not needed, and likely not desirable since the new indexing strategy with ECS fields should be sufficient and familiar way to handle these types of logs. \r\n\r\nFinally we discussed that a dedicated read end point only allows for a curated experience could come at the expense of being able to use standard tooling such as Kibana visualizations or alerts based on aggregations which some more advanced users may want to help track or monitor their usage of deprecated components. There are still plans to for a curated experience with these logs, but those discussions are not finalized and a dedicated endpoint is likely unnecessary. \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
