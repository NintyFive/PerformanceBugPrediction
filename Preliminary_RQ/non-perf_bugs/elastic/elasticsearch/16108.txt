Typically analysts might run some one-off queries over older time ranges causing the filter cache to blow up without any reason. In previous versions, we would have turned of caching for the time range filter for queries over older ranges. Getting the data would be slower, but given that the data is coming for older date range, people could live with it.\nI might be missing something, but right now it seems impossible to mimic this behaviour due to lack of configurability in choosing which queries to cache in the filter segment and which queries not to. The strategy  discussed in the aforementioned documentation make sense in most of the general situation, but not 100% of the time. I feel that the option should at-least be present so that people can use it in times of need.\nIf you don't mind my asking, what was the rationale behind the decision to remove the filter caching configuration, and are there any chances that this will be brought back in the future? \n","closed_by":{"login":"santanusinha","id":1593063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1593063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/santanusinha","html_url":"https://github.com/santanusinha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santanusinha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santanusinha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santanusinha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santanusinha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santanusinha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santanusinha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santanusinha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santanusinha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santanusinha/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
