My understanding is that it's purpose is to provide an aggregation to count parent docs.\n\nThe parent aggregation I'm talking about is an aggregation that would allow to nest other aggregation on parent field. for instance nest a term aggregation of a field that lives in the parent doc.\n\nIf you feel that #5306 and this issue are slightly different could you please reopen this one so we keep track of it?\nThx \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/125167382","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7972#issuecomment-125167382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7972","id":125167382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNTE2NzM4Mg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-27T11:07:26Z","updated_at":"2015-07-27T11:07:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @stephane-bastian \n\nIt's the same issue.
