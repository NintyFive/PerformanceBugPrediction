First, we require that an explicit mapping is setup on the \"office\" field that declares this field of one of the core types (here a string):\n\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"office\" : {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThen, to introduce a document with the field \"office\" having a boost of 2.0, we must use the following syntax:\n\n```\n{\n    \"office\" : {\n        \"_value\":  \"Bridgewater\",\n        \"_boost\":  2.0\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe mapping is required to disambiguate the meaning of the document.  Otherwise, ElasticSearch would interpret \"office\" as a value of type \"object\".\n\nThe key `_value` (or `value`)  in the inner document specifies the real string content that should eventually be indexed in Lucene (in the example, this is _Bridgewater_).  The `_boost` (or `boost`) key specifies the per field document boost (here 2.0)\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
