We want to be able to highlight a field in the inner hits, based on the whole query, not just the query defined in the scope of the child query.  \n\nI'm not sure if this is possible - but could not find any documentation. If this is not a bug/not possible then we will do it by manually setting the highlight query on the inner hits. \n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\nThis is a simplified version of our use case \n1. Create a mapping and insert some data\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST localhost:9200/test_index -d '{\n    \"settings\" : {\n        \"number_of_shards\" : 1\n    },\n    \"mappings\": {\n    \"profile\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n          \"id\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },        \n        \"summary\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"tweet\": {\n      \"_parent\": {\n        \"type\": \"profile\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"id\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },        \n        \"body\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test_index/profile/1 -d '{\n  \"name\" : \"Bob\",\n  \"summary\" : \"The quick brown fox\"\n}'\n\n\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test_index/tweet/100?parent=1 -d '{\n  \"body\" : \"I like football and tennis\"\n}'\n\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test_index/tweet/200?parent=1 -d '{\n  \"body\" : \"watching football\"\n}'\n```\n1.
