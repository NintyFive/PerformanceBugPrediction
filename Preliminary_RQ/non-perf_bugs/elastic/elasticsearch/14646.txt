Each condition needs to be configured with a path to extract the value in the document being processed from, an operation (<, <=, ==, >, >=) and an expected value. The processor has two list of processors, one list will be executed with all the conditions evaluate to `true` and one list of processors that will be executed when at least one condition evaluates to `false`.\n\nThe structure of the processor would look something like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"description\": \"_description\",\n  \"processors\": [\n    {\n      \"compare\": {\n        \"conditions\": [\n            \"<field1>\": { \"<op1>\": <match_value> }, //and\n            \"<field2>\": { \"<op2>\": <match_value> },\n            \"<field3>\": { \"<op3>\": <match_value> },\n            ...\n        ],\n        \"true_processors\": [...],\n        \"false_processors\": [...]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n(NOTE: temporary names)\n\nThe idea behind the structure of the processor is that nested of compare conditions is supported.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
