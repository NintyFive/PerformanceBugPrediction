ILM lets you configure a suitable force-merge action in an earlier phase but does not actively encourage its use, and we also see a need to support occasional writes in the warm phase so that the index may no longer be force-merged by the time it is moved to the cold phase.\r\n\r\nWe discussed this today and decided it would be good to add a force-merge step to the searchable snapshots action. This step would be enabled by default but we'd include an option to disable it. Force-merging an already-force-merged index is a no-op so it's ok always to run this step.","closed_by":{"login":"andreidan","id":1217601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1217601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan","html_url":"https://github.com/andreidan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreidan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
