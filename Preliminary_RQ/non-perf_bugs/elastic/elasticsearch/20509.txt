if so, the suggest query doesn't return anything.\n\nFor instance, the following indexed document contains an umlaut in the context \"\"MyUmlautSite\\u00e4\":\n\n```\n{\n    \"_index\": \"test\",\n    \"_type\": \"document\",\n    \"_id\": \"1\",\n    \"_score\": 0.59573317,\n    \"_source\": {\n        \"suggest_completion\": {\n            \"input\": [\n                \"mobilit\\u00e4tssysteme\",\n                \"technologien\",\n                \"l\\u00f6sungsans\\u00e4tzen\",\n                \"integration\",\n                \"personenmobilit\\u00e4t\"\n            ],\n            \"context\": {\n                \"sites\": [\n                    \"all\",\n                    \"MyUmlautSite\\u00e4\"\n                ]                            }\n        },\n        \"Title\": \"TestTitle\",\n        \"sites\": [\n            \"MyUmlautSite\\u00e4\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe umlaut's representation as \\u00e4 stems from the json formatting, we confirmed it's actually 'Ã¤' in the index as expected.\n\nWhen requesting suggestions like this, no results are being returned:\n\n```\n{\n        \"index\": \"test\",\n        \"size\": 0,\n        \"body\": {\n            \"suggest\": {\n                \"suggest\": {\n                    \"text\": \"integr\",\n                    \"completion\": {\n                        \"field\": \"suggest_completion\",\n                        \"size\": 10,\n                        \"context\": {\n                            \"sites\": \"MyUmlautSite\\u00e4\"\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    },\n```\n\nAgain, the actual request is being done with true unicode encoded Umlauts.\n\nAny ideas? Known bug?\n","closed_by":{"login":"areek","id":753679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/753679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek","html_url":"https://github.com/areek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
