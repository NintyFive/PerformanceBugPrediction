Since there are two declarations, there are two different functions ids which differ causing the folder to not find the match.\r\nA potential solution here is to find the duplicate functions and replace it however this needs to take into account any possible reference to either id.\r\n\r\n2. the second query works since the cast is removed/pruned since it has no effect (it's an int being casted to another int).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
