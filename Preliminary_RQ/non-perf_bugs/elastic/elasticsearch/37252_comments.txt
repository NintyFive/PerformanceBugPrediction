If you check out the `<sonarqube-dir>/temp/conf/es/elasticsearch.yml` you will see which is the actual configuration that is picked up. As far as I see you cannot edit this file since on every restart is overriden, and sonarqube says you can edit only some specific settings for elasticsearch in the `sonarqube-dir/conf/sonar.properties` file but it uses different names for them (e.g.: `sonar.search.httpPort` instead of es' `http.port`.\r\n\r\nYou would need to ask help from sonarqube on how to change the settings of their underlying elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nSince this is not an issue with Elasticsearch itself I hope you donâ€™t mind if I close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
