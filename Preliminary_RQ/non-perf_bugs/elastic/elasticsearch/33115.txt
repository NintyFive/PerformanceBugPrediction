But when the same is viewed on mobile or a tablet the lines get wrapped with respect to the screen.\r\n\r\nIt would be real nice and informative if we have a scroll bar rather and the lines un-wrapped.\r\n\r\nPlease kindly update if possible!\r\n\r\nView on Laptop screen\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38374696/44565373-67471200-a785-11e8-8e92-e36381b60cea.png)\r\n\r\nView on a tablet sized screen\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38374696/44565401-8e054880-a785-11e8-89e0-decca0b759ad.png)\r\n\r\nView on a mobile sized screen\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38374696/44565426-ae350780-a785-11e8-8aa2-2230d6236b2d.png)\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): v6.3.2 (On cloud Instance)\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is that one should be able to see the lines unwrapped.
