Of around 1.6 GBs of field data used per node, around 800 MBs is being used by a geo point field (on normal load). I don't understand this. If geo point fields get their field data stored on disk by default, shouldn't it not appear in the usage? I read somewhere that we see non-analyzed strings in the field data usage because of the global ordinals built for them, and I too see a few non-analyzed string fields in my cluster appearing under the usage (a few KBs only). But geo point appearing there seems quite unsettling. On heavy load, my nodes go out of memory and I can't seem to get around this problem. On analyzing a heap dump I found that Long objects are taking the maximum space there, so I figured doc_values could solve this problem.
