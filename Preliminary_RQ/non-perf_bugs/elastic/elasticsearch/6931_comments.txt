The reason why it fails is because I use a custom classloader in my application and so initialize the embedded elasticsearch node as follows-\n\n```\nImmutableSettings.Builder settingsBuilder = \n    ImmutableSettings.settingsBuilder().classLoader(getClass().getClassLoader()).put(\"cluster.name\", \"myCluster\")...\n```\n\nBut this gets overwritten later on during plugin initialization (as part of node startup) due to the code fragment I had highlighted earlier, and the classloader instance in ImmutableSettings get set to null. When Node-2 throws the DelayRecoveryException, the default webapp classloader will not be able to find this class (it requires the custom classloader I use).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/49526430","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6931#issuecomment-49526430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6931","id":49526430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTI2NDMw","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-19T18:45:47Z","updated_at":"2014-07-19T18:45:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"sorry, I've just seen the full issue report above - missed that when reading the email.
