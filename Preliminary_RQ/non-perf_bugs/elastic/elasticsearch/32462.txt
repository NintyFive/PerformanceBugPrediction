We have 3 independent locations - 2 fast location and 1 slow location. It is not a good idea to have a active master node in the slow location but in case of outage of the fast location it would be great to have one in this slow location.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to be able to configure something like: make me master only if necessary and in case of 3 master-eligible nodes available give it up and let one of the master nodes in fast location drive the cluster.\r\n\r\nBtw. in this case it will be never required to be master-node in slow location active. So something like \"quorum_only\" or \"arbiter_only\" config option would be great.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
