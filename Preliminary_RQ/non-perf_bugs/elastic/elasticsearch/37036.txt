Some feature requests are mentioned here https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14340 and here https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32462 but there is more what would be nice to have.\r\n\r\nUse case (our situation) - ES cluster with high load, 3 master eligible nodes in 2 fast locations (because it is impossible to have an arbiter node in slow location now), virtual machine nodes. If the cluster is under a heavy load, the master node has to be located on the low loaded hypervisor with dedicated CPUs (and memory) if possible. We are able to achieve that on one hypervisor, not all. So currently we have to restart each master node one by one until the required master node (the one located in fast location with low loaded hypervisor) will be elected.\r\n\r\nSo following features should be available:\r\n- Configurable master eligible nodes priority. If all the nodes are available, the master will be always the node with the highest priority.\r\n- API to force change master independently on its currently priority or other conditions. Very useful feature if finding performance bottlenecks.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
