2.0 as of #10461 we now allocate each shard on a node to whichever path.data has the most free space at the moment the shard is assigned to the node.\n\nBut in the case when a new node just started up, and suddenly gets a bunch of new shards assigned (new index), we will put all those shards onto a single path (the one with the most free space at that moment).\n\nI saw this happen on a node that had 2 identically sized SSDs on the path.data, but on one of them I had installed ES so it had a wee bit less disk space, and then all 5 shards of my new index were assigned to the other SSD.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikemccand","id":796508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/796508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemccand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
