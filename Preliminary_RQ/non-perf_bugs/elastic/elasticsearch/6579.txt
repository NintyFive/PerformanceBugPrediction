However the [docs for zen](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery-zen.html#master-election) refer to `ping_timeout` worse, it appears fault detection uses the `ping_timeout` name with no allowance for `ping.timeout` nor `ping.interval`, etc.\n\nIt seems like it would be more consistent to refer to the timeout value as `ping_timeout` in both the sample config as well as in the logs to avoid confusion.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
