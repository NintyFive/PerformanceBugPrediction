For multi-search/get queries, currently the user can put the indices in the request body, which poses a challenge to the URL-based security approach. \n\nThis request is to add a feature for multi-search/get such that when index(or indices) is given in the URL, prohibiting the request body to contain the index (indices). \n\nIn this way, all request to ES can be secured via URL.\n\nAdd a flag, called `rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index` that can be set in the settings/config (default to `true`). If set to `false`, will reject requests that have explicit index specified in their body.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
