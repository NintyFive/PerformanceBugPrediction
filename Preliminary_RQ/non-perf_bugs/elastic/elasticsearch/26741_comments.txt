I think they should run with `vagrant.boxes=all`, and I can add options for `linux-all` (the current behavior of `all`) and `windows-all`\r\n\r\nI see why we wouldn't want to mention the images explicitly in the Vagrantfile (although it looks like vagrant doesn't complain about not finding the image until you try to start it). They'll be hidden behind an environment variable in the Vagrantfile, something like\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(2) do |config|\r\n  if ENV['WINDOWS_PACKAGING']\r\n    config.vm.define 'windows-server-2012r2' do |config|\r\n      config.vm.box = ENV['WINDOWS_2012R2_VAGRANT_BOX']\r\n    end\r\n    config.vm.define 'windows-server-2016' do |config|\r\n      config.vm.box = ENV['WINDOWS_2016_VAGRANT_BOX']\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n  # the other boxes\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then gradle will decide whether to set these env variables.
