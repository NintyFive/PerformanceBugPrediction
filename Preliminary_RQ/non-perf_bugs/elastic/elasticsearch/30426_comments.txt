We do not consider this is a bug without evidence, it is usually a capacity problem. There are some changes that went into some versions of Elasticsearch to address some of these, but I don't know what version you're on so I can't even say what you're exposed to (see the first paragraph).\r\n\r\nElastic provides a [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) for asking general questions and instead prefers to use GitHub only for verified bug reports and feature requests. There's an active community there that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
