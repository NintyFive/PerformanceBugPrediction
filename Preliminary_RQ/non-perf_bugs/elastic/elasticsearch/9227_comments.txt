At DEBUG level, you should see messages like `Adding segment XYZ to be upgraded`.\n\nI will add a message for each index/shard when it is beginning the upgrade.  However, when it ends is a little ambiguous.  The current code calls `waitForMerges` (through a hack, because this method is no longer public on `IndexWriter`).  Really what we want is to wait for the chain of `findForcedMerges` to complete.  I can add a log message when we are \"done\" here, but it is not necessarily correct (could log after the real upgrade finished).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
