I suppose I am more complaining about an unexpected behaviour in what would seem to be a common situation. \r\n\r\nThe many indices are logstash's default action of creating one per day. It is reasonable for other users to run into this.\r\nI don't think that application should run out of memory like that. I was able to repeat this with 4 gigs setup on Amazon's ES service as well with same results. In my view, the expected behavior would be to stop receiving messages until it is ready to consume more.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
