We will cut branches like 2.4 from this when preparing to stabilize the branch for a release. You'll see the same thing for the 5.x series, we have a 5.x branch that is under active development and a 5.0 branch that is stable as we push towards the 5.0.0 release. Eventually there will be a 5.1 branch cut from 5.x.\n\nSo basically, if you want relatively stable links, you should not be linking to active trees like the 2.x trees. Note that the docs are living though, we do make changes to them in the stable branches and that does from time to time mean that links to these could be broken as well.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/253480807","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20907#issuecomment-253480807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20907","id":253480807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzQ4MDgwNw==","user":{"login":"olivere","id":134848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/134848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivere","html_url":"https://github.com/olivere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivere/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T10:53:23Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T10:53:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay.
