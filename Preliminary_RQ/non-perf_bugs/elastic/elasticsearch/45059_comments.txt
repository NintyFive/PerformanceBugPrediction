We are focusing on making the API more generate-able friendly, and the users can just include that `x-pack-core` jar in their source so they can use the builder. Once the API is generated, we can also generate builders for these types of things, which will be included in HLRC. \r\n\r\nBasically there is a workaround that does not involve duplicating more code, and that is to just use the non OSS jar in your source.
