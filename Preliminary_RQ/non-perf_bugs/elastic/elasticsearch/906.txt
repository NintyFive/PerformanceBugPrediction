So the 3 translog settings, if they are all changed to some ridiculously large number to ensure none of the conditions triggers a flush, and then a manual flush API call is done, it is safe to replicate the data directory to another location, and then reset the settings.\n> \n> Yes. It can be simplified, we can add a disable flush flag that can be set dynamically.\n\nThe use case for a disabled flush is to allow a manual flush to occur, and _then_ some other process, like an rsync, or a fast recursive hard-link (and then an rsync perhaps) to facilitate secondary/tertiary/Disaster Recovery site replicant of the index and meta data.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
