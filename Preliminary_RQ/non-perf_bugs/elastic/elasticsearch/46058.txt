However, this results in an error:\r\n\r\n`The [classic] similarity may not be used anymore. Please use the [BM25] similarity or build a custom [scripted] similarity instead.`\r\n\r\nThis seems consistent with this old discussion:\r\n[Disallow the `classic` (TF-IDF) similarity on 6.0 indices.](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23208)\r\n\r\nPerhaps this other discussion finally offered an alternative:\r\n[Add a scripted similarity.](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/25831)\r\n\r\nIt seems like the documentation should be updated to reflect these changes.
