API requests, e.g. \n\n  curl -XGET 'http://byyd30:9200/_cluster/health?pretty=true' \n\nare missing the last LF character (ran the commands on Unix/Linux). I use nxlog as data collector for several data collections out of ES. In result, the last curly bracket of the JSON output is missing and kills the processing.\n\nI double checked the output by writing the data into a file and hexedited that data:\n\n![missing-lf](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4394913/517728/babab694-bee7-11e2-9d54-1f3ed9ef991d.png)\n\nI checked the same on Windows (to eleminate any terminal influeneces).\n\nDo I'm wrong or is that \"normal\" - is it a feature/error? Has anyone else similiar issues with that?\n\nAny comment/help is appreciated.\n\nThanks a lot,\nJuergen\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
