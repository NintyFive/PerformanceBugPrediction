Moving average works on discrete buckets.  So if your histogram has 10 buckets, but you request \"9 partitions\", we'd have to put 0.9 buckets into each partition... which isn't doable.  The only way it'd work is if the number of partitions is a multiple/divisor of the histogram interval, which starts to get very unintuitive.\r\n\r\nI think the best thing to do is just run a pre-aggregation to find the min/max of your dataset and then scale the window size accordingly.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/326183789","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10002#issuecomment-326183789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10002","id":326183789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjE4Mzc4OQ==","user":{"login":"evanceheallyg","id":18122766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTIyNzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/18122766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanceheallyg","html_url":"https://github.com/evanceheallyg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanceheallyg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanceheallyg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanceheallyg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanceheallyg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanceheallyg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanceheallyg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanceheallyg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanceheallyg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evanceheallyg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-31T04:04:52Z","updated_at":"2017-08-31T04:04:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@polyfractal Thanks for the explanation and support. The problem is that we are using \"https://github.com/PhaedrusTheGreek/transform_vis\" for rendering the moving average in the dashboard and the _DASHBOARD_CONTEXT_ used to filter is automatically fetched from dashboard filters and not able to control the same. Do you foresee any workaround in this situation. \r\n\r\nAlso, is there any workaround for the edge policies. Since I work in aerospace domain, its mandatory for us to calculate the MA with the previous set of data points, for Ex, if the plotting data set starts with Jan 2017, still we have to sum up the  value from Jan 2017 and 11 months back, and move on.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
