This means, it is expected that (if successful) a response is returned immediately with the contents:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"acknowledged\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the query parameter `wait_for_completion` is set to `true`, we expect that when a response is returned from the API request, the `stop` operation has finished and the contents of the response are:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"stopped\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the response content for the `stop` request is `{ \"stopped\": true }` even if `wait_for_completion` is not specified or has the value `false`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Create a data frame transform\r\n 2. Stop the data frame transform using the `POST _data_frame/transforms/<some_transform_id>/_stop` API, without specifying the `wait_for_completion` query parameter or specifying it with the value `false`\r\n3. Notice that the response content says `{ \"stopped\": true }` instead of `{ \"acknowledged\": true }`\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hendrikmuhs","id":7126422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7126422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrikmuhs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikmuhs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
