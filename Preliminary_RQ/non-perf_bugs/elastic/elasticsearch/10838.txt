If someone steals the yml and key store file, they can open\nthe keystore and access to mimic the system. I wonder if there is a way to \ncreate a tag for the passwords in the yml file that will have the process \nprompt for the password at startup.\n\nFor example, in the yml:\n\n```\nmarvel.agent.exporter.es.ssl.truststore.password: 123password\n```\n\nwill become:\n\n```\nmarvel.agent.exporter.es.ssl.truststore.password: -\n```\n\nand the system will then prompt the user for the password at start up:\n\n```\nEnter password for marvel.agent.exporter.es.ssl.truststore: \n```\n\nHopefully, the password is a strong one. But it won't be recorded and \nbe visible.\n\nIf the yml file is stolen, it won't have sufficient information to crack the key\nstore. For multiple password entries, they will be prompted in their order\nof appearance.\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
