For example, in HBase one can write a [coprocessor](https://hbase.apache.org/testdevapidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/coprocessor/SampleRegionWALObserver.html) to stream WAL edits out of the database as they happen. [A extensions for PostgreSQL](https://github.com/confluentinc/bottledwater-pg) exist that lets you do the same thing.\n> \n> I've Googled and I've not found a way to harness the Elasticsearch translog. I've looked at the plugin APIs but not found anything that lets you get at the translog.
