It would be very similar to the existing count API.\n\nThis API will be faster then using the Count API (setting terminate_after=1) in the general case, as it would return the response after the first shard reports existing documents, instead of blocking for responses from all the shards. In the worst case, if no documents actually exists, it would be as performant as using the Count API with terminate_after=1.\n\n(Check corresponding PR for req/response)\n\nrelated to #6876 \n","closed_by":{"login":"areek","id":753679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/753679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek","html_url":"https://github.com/areek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
