However, this means updating responses to the search API to include thiss information, modifying the Lucene collectors to expose this offset and more generally propagating this information from the collector up to the search response, so that would not be a trivial change. I suggest that we keep this issue open for some time in order to gauge how much interest it gathers.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/375397801","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22364#issuecomment-375397801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22364","id":375397801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTM5NzgwMQ==","user":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-22T17:46:36Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T17:46:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @elastic/es-search-aggs\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/390692200","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22364#issuecomment-390692200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22364","id":390692200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDY5MjIwMA==","user":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-21T15:38:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-21T15:38:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since we did not see much interest in this issue, and because it will require a lot of modifications, and there is a workaround from the client size, I am closing this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
