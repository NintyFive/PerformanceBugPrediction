I think what you're seeing is \"bouncing results\" - documents in different shards are stored in different segments, which means that the scores are slightly different. If you use ?preference=$session_id or something similar to ensure that the same user always hits the same shard copy, this behaviour should disappear.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/276090747","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22836#issuecomment-276090747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22836","id":276090747,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjA5MDc0Nw==","user":{"login":"tdoman","id":11098266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk4MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11098266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdoman","html_url":"https://github.com/tdoman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdoman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdoman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdoman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdoman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdoman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdoman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdoman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdoman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdoman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-30T15:22:49Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T16:22:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley Indeed, I had thought the same thing as I had employed the \"preference\" setting for bouncing results before.
