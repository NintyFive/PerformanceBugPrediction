Some other arguments seem to be throwing illegal argument exceptions as well. \n\nAlso, of note, this behavior might cause some new to information retrieval users, like myself, to be quite confused. I think it just needs more attention in the documentation, so I will put a small note on this page. Notice my query below to _suggest REST API. If I leave the size as default for the candidate generator, it never finds \"towel\" for \"paper tawl\" even though it is the second most common phrase with the word paper. If I override size to 10 in the candidate generator, it finds it and puts it at position 2. So, obviously users need to understand that the direct generator doesn't care about the whole phrase, it is merely providing candidates for the phrase suggest to use in it's shingle calculations. I'm not sure how the candidate generator sorts, but I can see that tawl scores very low by default on a text suggest, but is ordered much higher when it comes to frequency sorting.\n\nOf course it is definitely a balancing act, but just wanted to throw this out there for any google ninjas.\n\n{\n  \"text\": \"paper tawl\",\n  \"did_you_mean\": {\n    \"phrase\": {\n      \"field\": \"description_spellcheck_biword_shingle\",\n      \"size\": 5,\n      \"direct_generator\": [\n        {\n          \"field\": \"description_plain\",\n          \"max_edits\": 2,\n          \"size\": 10\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n//with size 10, we get the right results\n    did_you_mean: [\n        {\n            text: paper tawl\n            offset: 0\n            length: 10\n            options: [\n                {\n                    text: paper table\n                    score: 0.005753702\n                }\n                {\n                    text: paper towel\n                    score: 0.00501787\n                }\n                {\n                    text: paper take\n                    score: 0.002958646\n                }\n                {\n                    text: paper tall\n                    score: 0.000378143\n                }\n                {\n                    text: paper teal\n                    score: 0.00027579395\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n//if we don't give it enough candidates, we don't get the right results\ndid_you_mean: [\n\n```\n{\n    text: paper tawl\n    offset: 0\n    length: 10\n    options: [\n        {\n            text: paper table\n            score: 0.005753702\n        }\n        {\n            text: paper take\n            score: 0.002958646\n        }\n        {\n            text: paper tall\n            score: 0.000378143\n        }\n        {\n            text: paper tank\n            score: 0.00022716245\n        }\n        {\n            text: paper tail\n            score: 0.000048908416\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n]\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/16180010","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2709#issuecomment-16180010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2709","id":16180010,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTgwMDEw","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-10T15:04:56Z","updated_at":"2013-04-10T15:04:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hey, yeah I am sorry it's not perfect so you still need to know something about how the software works.
