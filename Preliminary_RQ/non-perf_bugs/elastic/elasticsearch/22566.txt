as discussed before, nowadays we have the following method to discover and assign the address based on AWS-elasticsearch configuration options:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            String address = null;\r\n            switch (hostType) {\r\n                case PRIVATE_DNS:\r\n                    address = instance.getPrivateDnsName();\r\n                    break;\r\n                case PRIVATE_IP:\r\n                    address = instance.getPrivateIpAddress();\r\n                    break;\r\n                case PUBLIC_DNS:\r\n                    address = instance.getPublicDnsName();\r\n                    break;\r\n                case PUBLIC_IP:\r\n                    address = instance.getPublicIpAddress();\r\n                    break;\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is defined in the following class: [AwsEc2UnicastHostsProvider](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/e5d9f393f140d41be470c4bfbe7cfe97d05b370c/plugins/discovery-ec2/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/discovery/ec2/AwsEc2UnicastHostsProvider.java#L157-L170)\r\n\r\nWhen there is no public DNS available, and you are using certificate that is using host-name or DNS that doesn't match, there is no way to avoid a certificate error when using SSL with Elasticsearch. We should be able to assign the hostname/address based on any AWS instance metadata. Basically we can do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiscovery.ec2.host_type: _meta:XYZ_\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of (just):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiscovery.ec2.host_type: private_ip\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way the hostname verification will work as long as the metadata is fine, and it's returning a valid hostname for this cases.\r\n\r\nCC @jaymode @tvernum \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
