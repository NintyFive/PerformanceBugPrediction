All other settings must be set on each individual index.\r\n\r\nThe way the text is worded above suggests that there may be other ones. It will be helpful to add a short note to each [index module setting](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/index-modules.html) that can be set as a node level setting.
