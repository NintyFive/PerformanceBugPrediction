You're using the top-level `filter` (now renamed `post_filter`) which is only applied to the `hits` AFTER aggregations have been calculated.  If you want it to apply to aggregations, then you should use a `filtered` query instead.\n\nIf this isn't your issue, then please provide a complete recreation (including creating the index, putting the mapping, inserting docs, running the query, and tell us what results you are expecting and how the existing results are different).\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/76510579","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8630#issuecomment-76510579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8630","id":76510579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NTEwNTc5","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-28T04:51:36Z","updated_at":"2015-02-28T04:51:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No more info provided.
