They will match nothing and without a foreground set will contribute nothing in the way of foreground or background statistics. Playing with size settings won't alter the fact that an empty query result = an empty response from that shard.\r\n\r\nWhile time-based indices are the right approach for ageing content efficiently they are not the right physical arrangement for this type of analysis. You'll need to adopt another approach.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
