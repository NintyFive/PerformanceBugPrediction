But when I overwrite a document for updating it, its integrity across pages is messed up.\nSome documents show up twice, triple or more and some don't show up. The _id is the same and everything looks normal, except this pagination problem. They are not lost! If I fetch all documents, they are still there and after downgrading to 0.20.6 while keeping everything else the same, pagination works like a charm.\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"thing\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"type\": \"multi_field\",\n        \"fields\": {\n          \"name\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"index\": \"analyzed\"\n          },\n          \"sortable\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"sclausen","id":916076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/916076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sclausen","html_url":"https://github.com/sclausen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sclausen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sclausen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sclausen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sclausen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sclausen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sclausen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sclausen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sclausen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sclausen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
