You can execute Gradle using the wrapper via the gradlew script in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\nThis mean looks like that you can use the `gradle` command if you have run the `gradlew` script.\r\nAnd after all the example commands use `gradle` command like this.\r\n\r\n> Eclipse users can automatically configure their IDE: `gradle eclipse` then.....\r\n\r\nBut, If you use gradle wrapper for starting task, you must use `./gradlew <task>` in the root of the repository.\r\nSo I think we need to \r\n- add gradle version that needs to build ES \r\nor \r\n- add some detail explanation\r\nor\r\n- edit `gradle` -> `gradlew`\r\netc...\r\n\r\nIf you do not mind, I want to make it my first commit.\r\nthanks!\r\n  ","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
