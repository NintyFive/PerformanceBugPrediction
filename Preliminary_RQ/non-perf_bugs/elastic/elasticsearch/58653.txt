This image has in total 33 CVE violations(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). Due to this, i cannot proceed ahead and it is kind of blocker for me. These violations are mainly in libxml2 and python library.\r\n\r\nI updated the image version from 7.7.1 to 7.8.0, but this image version also has same CVE issues.\r\nPlease help me in resolving these CVE issues.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**: The image should get downloaded without any CVE issues.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
