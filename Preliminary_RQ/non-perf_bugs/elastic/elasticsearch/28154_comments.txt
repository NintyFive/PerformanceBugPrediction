The elastic search is running on production and index mapping, Analyzer Settings are created manually . I have to verify whether Custom Analyzer that I am creating in above code snippet is actually mimicking production analyzer settings properly or not. The elasticsearch production machine is behaving correctly if I expect stemmed results out of a query string. But in Custom Analyzer as I explained above stemmming is not happening.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/356946264","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28154#issuecomment-356946264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28154","id":356946264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1Njk0NjI2NA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-11T14:16:13Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T14:16:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ajeetiiita Then the method you should call is `Analyzer.tokenStream`, not `Analyzer.normalize` which only applies a subset of the analysis chain.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
