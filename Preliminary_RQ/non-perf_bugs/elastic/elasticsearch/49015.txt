I'm not so clear about the proper strategy. I need an advice. Let me know if there any other solution.\r\n\r\n**Setup:**\r\n3 master and 10 data nodes cluster\r\n\r\n**Option 1:**\r\n1. Disable shard allocation (if it's a data node).\r\n2. Stop ES service on the node.\r\n3. Upgrade it.\r\n4. Start ES service.\r\n5. Re-enable shard allocation.\r\n6. Wait till cluster back to the green state.\r\n7. Proceed to the next node and repeat all the steps.\r\n\r\n**Option 2:**\r\n1. Disable shard allocation.\r\n2. Stop ES service on the node.\r\n3. Upgrade it.\r\n4. Start ES service\r\n5. Proceed to the next node and repeat the steps 2-4.\r\n6.
