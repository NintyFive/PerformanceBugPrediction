I tried to upgrade from ES 1.4.4 to 1.7.1.\n\nES does run as unprivileged user.\n\nError output while starting:\n\n> bin/elasticsearch: HOSTNAME=: is not an identifier\n\nIt seems that in contrast to 1.4.4 there is line 151 of\n\n> elasticsearch-1.7.1/bin/elasticsearch\n\nwhich tries to export the environment variable \"HOSTNAME\". The value is assigned via \"hostname -s\" which is not available in Solaris.\n\nThis feature seems to have been introduced in #8470. Since I have defined my node name via \"node.name\" this is not quite an issue with exporting the HOSTNAME variable but rather with the switch that is not supported on Solaris.\n\nAnd yes. I apologize for still being forced to use Solaris, but that's the way it is ;)\n\nCheers\nThomas\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
