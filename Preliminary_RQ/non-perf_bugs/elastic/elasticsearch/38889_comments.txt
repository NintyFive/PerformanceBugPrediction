Weird that we have not found it before, this is caused by a serialization bug in simple query string that was introduced with `6.0.0-alpha1`. All 6.x releases are affected, meaning that whenever simple query string is serialized between 5.6 and 6.x, the read and write end don't match causing the errors that you've seen. It is not a CCS bug specifically, mixed clusters are affected too.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/464079050","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38889#issuecomment-464079050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/38889","id":464079050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDA3OTA1MA==","user":{"login":"consulthys","id":1280019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODAwMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1280019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys","html_url":"https://github.com/consulthys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/consulthys/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-15T14:57:07Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T14:57:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot for looking into and fixing this @javanna, I'm glad you found the issue!\r\n\r\nFor others stumbling onto the same issue, we've reverted back to use `query_string` instead (which is admittedly less safe and more sensible to user input), but at least doesn't suffer from the same serialization issue.
