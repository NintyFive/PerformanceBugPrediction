following is probably obvious (and likely the intent of the test):\n\nThe GeoJSON in the query request is invalid.  e.g., \n\n``` java\n\"shape\": {\n          \"type\": \"point\",\n          \"coordinates\": [[\"4.901238\",\"52.36936\"]]\n        }\n```\n\nShould either be:\n\n``` java\n\"type\": \"multipoint\",\n...\n```\n\nor:\n\n``` java\n...\n\"coordinates\": [\"4.901238\",\"52.36936\"]}\n```\n\nSame with the polygon - it should be an array of LinearRings (closed LineStrings).   \n\nI'll add a more useful parse error message instead of the \"give up\" NPE.  \n\nFYI, most of the shape parsing logic can use better error handling so I'm certain this isn't the last NPE parse error.  I'll be adding better error handling as I go so add the issues as you find them.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/65689057","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8432#issuecomment-65689057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8432","id":65689057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Njg5MDU3","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-04T19:35:21Z","updated_at":"2014-12-04T19:35:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"if ripping it out and redo is a potential better solution I am all for it @nknize especially if we can add unittests to it as well :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
