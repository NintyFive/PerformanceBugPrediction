Sometimes the template definitions for a lot of versions is the same. It would be great to be able to create template with match to \"filebeat-6.2.*\" and if needed add another one with \"order: 2\" matching \"filebeat-6.2.3\". The second template should replace (not merge with) the first template. The replace/merge decision could be controlled by some \"template uuid\". If two templates share the same uuid, the template with higher order will replace the other one.","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
