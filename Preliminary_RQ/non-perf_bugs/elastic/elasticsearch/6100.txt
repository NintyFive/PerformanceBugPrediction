It results in exception being thrown during execution of logger.trace()  which later lead to NoNodeAvailable exception down the road.\n\nThanks,\nIgor.\n\nprotected ImmutableList<DiscoveryNode> validateNewNodes(Set<DiscoveryNode> nodes) {\n            for (Iterator<DiscoveryNode> it = nodes.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {\n                DiscoveryNode node = it.next();\n                if (!transportService.nodeConnected(node)) {\n                    try {\n                        logger.trace(\"connecting to node [{}]\", node);\n                        transportService.connectToNode(node);\n                    } catch (Throwable e) {\n                        it.remove();\n                        logger.debug(\"failed to connect to discovered node [\" + node + \"]\", e);\n                    }\n\nMay  8 11:15:28 9.21.119.107 [dataNode.dataNode] [Ariel Writer#events] org.elasticsearch.client.transport.NoNodeAvailableException: No node available\nMay  8 11:15:28 9.21.119.107 [dataNode.dataNode] [Ariel Writer#events]    at org.elasticsearch.client.transport.TransportClientNodesService.execute(TransportClientNodesService.java:219)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
