use-case a bit more and what type of distance queries you are interested in doing?\r\n\r\nSure, and my apologies if this is the wrong thread for this. My use case is querying for arbitrary shapes (can be points, multipoints, geometrycollection, polygon, etc...) at a certain distance from a point (actually thousands of points, but we handle this with a bool query). Due to geo_distance only working point-to-point, the workaround way to do this used to be to intersect a circle shape with the relevant index containing the arbitrary shapes. However, due to 6.8’s BKD indexing methodology not working with circles and geoshape intersection, I am left with using the deprecated geohash or prefixtree indexing or turning the circles into polygons and intersecting those. Both these workarounds are not good in my opinion, and are really just backwards ways to do a basic distance filter between a point and a shape, which geo_distance currently doesn’t support.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
