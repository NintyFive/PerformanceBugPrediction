Enabling a disabled object means that all sub fields indexed prior to the enablement of the object will be ignored, but not those indexed after the object has been enabled. This can make issues harder to track, and could create all kinds of weird situations, like indices that refuse to reindex with the same mappings, etc. I can't find the issue but I believe the same argument made us disallow updating the date format on `date` fields in the past.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/355306934","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28070#issuecomment-355306934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28070","id":355306934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTMwNjkzNA==","user":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-04T15:11:36Z","updated_at":"2018-01-04T15:11:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We
