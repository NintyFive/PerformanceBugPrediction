I don't think we need caching, and if this turn out to be problematic, we can certainly consider alternatives such as a read-write lock. For now what we have is relatively simple to reason about and doesn't appear to be harmful (everything that happens under a lock here is extremely cheap).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/523946144","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45819#issuecomment-523946144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45819","id":523946144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzk0NjE0NA==","user":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-22T15:05:49Z","updated_at":"2019-08-22T15:05:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Makes sense to me especially in light of `SecurityActionFilter`, thanks for the explanation.
