How you get that from Spring Boot's `ElasticsearchRepository` is a question for the spring boot folks. The other parameters like `rest_total_hits_as_int` and `typed_keys` are kind of implementation details of the high level client. They make Elasticsearch emit data in a way that the high level client prefers.  ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
