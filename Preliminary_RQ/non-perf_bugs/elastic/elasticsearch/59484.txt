It throws a `400` error if the name is missing. However, when using the grant API key action, it is possible to create a key without a name. This is because the `name` field is nested under `api_key` field for the input of grant API key action, i.e.:\r\n```json\r\n{ \r\n    \"...\": \"...\",\r\n    \"api_key\": {\"name\": \"key-1\"}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough the `name` field is still mandatory, the parent `api_key` field is optional. Thus allow keys be created without names.","closed_by":{"login":"ywangd","id":2344308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDQzMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2344308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd","html_url":"https://github.com/ywangd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
