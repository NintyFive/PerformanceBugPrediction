This indeed looks like a bug, both `basic_date||strict_date_optional_time` should use  UTC timezone as default. They in fact do, but the validation logic in 7.2 is incorrect.\r\nThe validation in ES 7.5 is less strict so this  should work.\r\nAlso if you plan on using yyyyMMdd , it would be better to use `uuuuMMdd`. We use strict resolving in 7.5 so it might not work for some scenarios for you.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/617872254","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44640#issuecomment-617872254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44640","id":617872254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzg3MjI1NA==","user":{"login":"pgomulka","id":11137008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTM3MDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11137008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka","html_url":"https://github.com/pgomulka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-22T16:04:13Z","updated_at":"2020-04-22T16:04:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tstilwell I hope my previous comment is sufficient to work around.
