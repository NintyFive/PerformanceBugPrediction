version**: 5.3.2\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: []\r\n\r\n**JVM version**: 1.8.0_121\r\n\r\n**OS version**: Windows 10\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nUsing `toString()` on a `DateHistogramAggregationBuilder` (and most likely other aggregation builders as well) yields the following result:\r\n```\r\n{ \"error\" : \"JsonGenerationException[Can not write a field name, expecting a value]\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected result is something along the lines of:\r\n```\r\n{ \"my_aggr\" : { \"date_histogram\" : { ... } } }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nRun the following class (adding more calls to the builder continues to yield the same result):\r\n```\r\nimport org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.AggregationBuilders;\r\n\r\npublic class Test {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        System.out.println(\r\n
