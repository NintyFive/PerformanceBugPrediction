I have a problem with multiple types.\nIf I specify multiple type with comma, It's getting data from just one specific type.\n\nLet's assume that we have an index which name is \"account_test\"\n\"account\" has 3 types in it which are \"Campaign\", \"Advertiser\", \"Agency\"\n\n\"Campaign\" has one data as below\n\n```\n{\n    \"_index\": \"account_test\",\n    \"_type\": \"Campaign\",\n    \"_id\": \"102399\",\n    \"_score\": 1,\n    \"_source\": {\n    \"ID\": \"CM_12022015\",\n    \"NAME\": \"CM_12022015\",\n    \"Advertiser\": {\n        \"ID\": \"Adv_12022015\",\n        \"NAME\": \"unknown_advertiser\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\"Advertiser\" has one data as below\n\n```\n{\n    \"_index\": \"account_test\",\n    \"_type\": \"Advertiser\",\n    \"_id\": \"52957\",\n    \"_score\": 1,\n    \"_source\": {\n        \"ID\": \"Adv_12022015\",\n        \"NAME\": \"unknown_advertiser\",\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow I want to find these with the keyword \"Adv_12022015\".\n- **No type specified in URL**\n\n```\nhttp://eshost:9200/account_test/_search?q=Campaign.Advertiser.ID:*adv_12022015* OR Advertiser.ID:*adv_12022015*\n// Total : 2\n```\n\nIt is getting both 2 data correctly.\nHowever If I specify types in it, It only gets \"Campaign\" data.\n- **Single type**\n\n```\nhttp://eshost:9200/account_test/Campaign/_search?q=Campaign.Advertiser.ID:*adv_12022015* OR Advertiser.ID:*adv_12022015*\n// Total : 1\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nhttp://eshost:9200/account_test/Advertiser/_search?q=Campaign.Advertiser.ID:*adv_12022015* OR Advertiser.ID:*adv_12022015*\n// Total : 1\n```\n\nIt works correctly. Both query gets data from each specified type.\n- **Multiple types with comma**\n\n```\nhttp://eshost:9200/account_test/Advertiser,Campaign/_search?q=Campaign.Advertiser.ID:*adv_12022015* OR Advertiser.ID:*adv_12022015*\n// Total : 1\n```\n\nHowever If I specify multiple types with comma in url, it gets only data from \"Campaign\".\n\nSingle type is fine, It is only a problem when I use multiple type with comma.\nI think it is similar to the issue [#2218](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2218)\n\nPlease check it out.\nThank you.\n\nInstalled Elastic Search Info\n{\n  \"status\": 200,\n  \"name\": \"node1\",\n  \"cluster_name\": \"es.oas.cluster\",\n  \"version\": {\n    \"number\": \"1.4.2\",\n    \"build_hash\": \"927caff6f05403e936c20bf4529f144f0c89fd8c\",\n    \"build_timestamp\": \"2014-12-16T14:11:12Z\",\n    \"build_snapshot\": false,\n    \"lucene_version\": \"4.10.2\"\n  },\n  \"tagline\": \"You Know, for Search\"\n}\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
