If you delete the checksum marker you are just bringing back your corrupted shard. if you have primaries that are corrupted (btw. they might have been corrupted for a long time already but old ES version didn't check this. What I am wondering about is why you now see this since 1.0.x didn't even write checksums on the lucene level so the on-merge theory is wrong. I also don't see the problem in the logs. ES `1.4.1` now checks old files checksums with the old `Adler32` checksums from ES which can explain your problems but apparently they are only happening on relocation / recovery right? Can you tell if it happened during  a recovery or a relocation? is your primary affected too? if so I don't think it's easy to recover without reindexing to be honest...\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/65940467","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8805#issuecomment-65940467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8805","id":65940467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1OTQwNDY3","user":{"login":"bluelu","id":339893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/339893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu","html_url":"https://github.com/bluelu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-07T15:18:18Z","updated_at":"2014-12-07T15:18:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When the cluster was running before we didn't observe any checksum errors, except for 3 indexes which really had checksum errors (and lucene's checkindex script also detected them).\n\nWe then restarted the cluster, and it turned yellow on those indexes, so all primaries were successfully allocated and the cluster was in YELLOW state.
