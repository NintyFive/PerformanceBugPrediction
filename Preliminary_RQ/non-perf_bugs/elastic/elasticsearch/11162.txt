Runnable code reproducing this issue can be found [here](https://github.com/leourbina/ElasticSearchTests/blob/master/src/test/java/elasticsearch/ElasticSearchTests.java#L128). The relevant portion is the below:\n\nWe setup two `matchAll` queries and index them with some accompanying metadata (`userId`)\n\n``` java\nMatchAllQueryBuilder query1 = QueryBuilders.matchAllQuery();\nMatchAllQueryBuilder query2 = QueryBuilders.matchAllQuery();\n\nclient.prepareIndex(INDEX, PERCOLATOR_TYPE, \"query1\")\n    .setSource(XContentFactory.jsonBuilder()\n        .startObject()\n        .field(\"query\", query1)\n        .field(\"userId\", 1)\n        .endObject())\n    .execute().actionGet();\n\nclient.prepareIndex(INDEX, PERCOLATOR_TYPE, \"query2\")\n    .setSource(XContentFactory.jsonBuilder()\n        .startObject()\n        .field(\"query\", query1)\n        .field(\"userId\", 2)\n        .endObject())\n    .execute().actionGet();\n```\n\nPercolating a document yields both queries without filtering yields both queries, as expected:\n\n``` java\nPercolateResponse result = client.preparePercolate()\n    .setIndices(INDEX)\n    .setDocumentType(type)\n    .setSource(anyDoc)\n    .execute().actionGet();\n```\n\nHowever, adding a term filter by `userId`, yields no results:\n\n``` java\nPercolateResponse filteredResult = client.preparePercolate()\n    .setIndices(INDEX)\n    .setDocumentType(tweet.getType())\n    .setSource(anyDoc)\n    .setPercolateFilter(FilterBuilders.termFilter(\"userId\", 1))\n    .execute().actionGet();\n```\n\nInstead, I'm seeing the following shard failures being returned in the `PercolateResponse`.\n\n```\n[my-index-1][0] failed, reason [BroadcastShardOperationFailedException[[my-index-1][0] ]; nested: PercolateException[failed to percolate]; nested: ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException[Nothing to percolate]; ]\n```\n\nI have verified that _it is_ possible to perform filtering/querying on the percolator directly via the REST api. At this point I'm not sure whether this is a legitimate bug, or whether I'm somehow misusing the Java API (I must admit, the docs relevant docs/javadocs are [pretty light on the subject](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/current/percolate.html)). Any ideas?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
