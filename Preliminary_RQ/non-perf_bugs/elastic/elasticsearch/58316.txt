There is interest in adding the following data stream related information:\r\n* Composable index template name that matches with a data stream\r\n* The ilm policy used for a data stream. I think multiple need to be returned, because if a ilm policy changes the historic backing indices will properly use the old ilm policy?\r\n* The health status of a data stream. If at least one backing index is red or yellow than the data stream should report that too.\r\n* The accumulated used disk space of a data stream. \r\n* The timestamp of the last indexed document.\r\n* (tbd)\r\n\r\nSome of these stats are relatively expensive to compute compared to the information returned from the get data streams api (which reads from cluster state).
