(The `.sample` file is dropped by the FreeBSD package, as per convention)\n\nThis leads to the following startup error, which was initially tricky to diagnose... as logging didn't work :)\n\n`org.elasticsearch.common.settings.SettingsException: Failed to load settings from [file:/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/logging.yml.sample] [...] Caused by: org.elasticsearch.common.jackson.core.JsonParseException: Unexpected character ('#' (code 35)): expected a valid value (number, String, array, object, 'true', 'false' or 'null')`\n\nI feel that walking the tree and using _all_ `logging.*` files will invite a lot of unexpected problems for others in the future too. For instance, think of someone editing the file and keeping the original in `logging.yml.bak`, which now also is parsed as JSON and causes the same startup failure.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62742409","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8040#issuecomment-62742409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8040","id":62742409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzQyNDA5","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-12T16:05:46Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T16:06:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is being addressed in #7457. The plan would be to load only `logging.*.yml`, `logging.*.yaml`, `logging.*.json` and `logging.*.properties`, but keep throwing exception if the parsing of one of the files is problematic.
