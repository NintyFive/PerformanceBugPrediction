Think about it this way, if you run into this you must have deleted the plugin folder, since all of the elasticsearch distributions (tar.gz/zip, rpm, deb) contain an empty folder by default. If you deleted it, you might also have deleted plugins important for the correct functionality of the node you are starting. So I think this should be a hard error.
