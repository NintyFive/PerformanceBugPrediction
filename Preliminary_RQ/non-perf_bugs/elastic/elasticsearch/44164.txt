the failing test is `ShrinkIndexIT.testCreateShrinkWithIndexSort`, see for example https://gradle.com/s/fglguuelmqobe\r\n\r\nMore recently a failure of `ShrinkIndexIT.testShrinkCommitsMergeOnIdle` was seen but with the same error message: https://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+pull-request-1/2405/testReport/junit/org.elasticsearch.action.admin.indices.create/ShrinkIndexIT/testShrinkCommitsMergeOnIdle/\r\n\r\nIn both cases the error message is something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected at least one master-eligible node left in {node_sc1=org.elasticsearch.test.InternalTestCluster$NodeAndClient@2de106c0}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA REPRO command for 7.x is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew :server:integTest --tests
