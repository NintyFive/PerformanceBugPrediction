We decided that it is better to not allow this error-prone option. Note that kibana visualizations and further aggregations on the transform dest index use doc values.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransform follows the logic and syntax of aggregations as much as possible, however this isn't always possible and in some cases it does not make sense, e.g. as transform indexes the data we have to think 1 step further than aggregations, which \"only\" respond to search requests.\r\n\r\nCustom formatted date strings can be created using an ingest pipeline:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT _ingest/pipeline/custom_date\r\n{\r\n  \"description\" : \"Set a custom date\",\r\n  \"processors\" : [\r\n    {\r\n      \"date\" : {\r\n        \"field\" : \"dateTime\",\r\n        \"target_field\" : \"dateTime-custom\",\r\n        \"formats\" : [\"UNIX_MS\"],\r\n        \"output_format\" : \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can specify this pipeline as part of `dest`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"dest\":{\r\n  \"index\":\"hourly_data_aggregations\",\r\n  \"pipeline\": \"custom_date\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my example I wrote a new field, of course you can overwrite the existing field, too. Note, that you must create the destination index yourself with the right mapping.\r\n\r\nI am closing this issue and hope the provided workaround works for you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
