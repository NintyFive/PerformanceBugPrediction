One shard succeeds in adding a `double` field, then the other tries to add an `integer` field, which causes a merge conflict (because the field already exists and is of a different datatype).\n\nIf you were to reindex the integer document, it would be coerced to a double and accepted, but it'd be really hard to add this \"retry\" logic into the mapping code.  I think there are two practical solutions here:\n- map your fields ahead of time, or\n- ensure that fields with the same name contain the same datatype (ie pass `1.0` instead of `1`)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/171636027","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15961#issuecomment-171636027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15961","id":171636027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTYzNjAyNw==","user":{"login":"yzprofile","id":1056285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTYyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1056285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzprofile","html_url":"https://github.com/yzprofile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzprofile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzprofile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzprofile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzprofile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzprofile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzprofile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzprofile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzprofile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzprofile/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-14T12:50:40Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T12:50:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your time to explain, Issue close. \n\nThanks.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
