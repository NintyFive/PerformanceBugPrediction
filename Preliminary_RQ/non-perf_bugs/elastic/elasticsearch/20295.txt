When I use bootstrap.memory_lock: true Elastic keeps running as expected. It seems there is something fishy going on with the deprecation setting not working although I can't pinpoint why that is.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Using ES 2.4.0 set bootstrap.mlockall: true\n2. Set ES_HEAP_SIZE to a big chunk of the total available memory\n3. Generate some load and wait \n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**: Nothing is logged and it's not the OOM killer that was responsible for the process disappearing. Elastic just dies without notice.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ygersie","id":6005868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDU4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6005868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygersie","html_url":"https://github.com/ygersie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygersie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygersie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygersie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygersie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygersie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygersie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygersie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygersie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygersie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
