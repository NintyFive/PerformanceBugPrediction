Then set number_number_of_replicas to 1 and refresh_interval to \"1s\" and add some more documents. The primary and replicas are out of sync, it looks like the replica doesn't have the new documents. See this gist for a repro:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/msimos/869292265208852fbee4\n\nIf you run the match_all query multiple times you'll see the different documents returned. If you use preference=_primary then all documents are returned. If the query hits the replica, then only the first documents are returned when replicas were set to 0. Also using _cat/shards you can see the size difference between the shards.\n\nIt seems you can workaround this by doing sending this in two separate calls:\n\n```\nPUT /index/_settings\n{\n  \"number_of_replicas\": 1\n}\n\nPUT /index/_settings\n{\n  \"refresh_interval\": \"1s\"\n}\n```\n\nAlso seems the ordering matters, that \"number_of_replicas\": 1 is set before \"refresh_interval\": \"1s\". This was on Elasticsearch 1.7.2.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
