know there is a deb package (and an rpm) available on the downloads page, but it would definitely make things considerably easier to install elasticsearch if there were a PPA (or equivalent for RPMs). My current approach is to use a rather [unwieldy puppet module](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/puppet-elasticsearch) to install the latest version. It would be vastly simpler -- for me and others -- if you could just install elasticsearch with the more user-friendly package managers (apt-get, yum, etc). \n\nI admittedly don't know much about preparing a PPA (or equivalent for yum-based package management).
