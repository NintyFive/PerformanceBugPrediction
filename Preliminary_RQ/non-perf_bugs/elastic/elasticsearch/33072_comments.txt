This parameter is also exposed to the msearch API, and the same value will be used for each search request included in the msearch request body. It sounds like that would be something along the lines of what you were looking for when you opened the issue, what do you think?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/481037941","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33072#issuecomment-481037941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33072","id":481037941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTAzNzk0MQ==","user":{"login":"ebernhardson","id":558434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/558434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebernhardson","html_url":"https://github.com/ebernhardson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebernhardson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebernhardson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebernhardson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebernhardson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebernhardson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebernhardson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebernhardson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebernhardson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebernhardson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T22:58:19Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T22:58:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thought about it a bit, this is still indirectly controlling what I would like, but it's significantly better than the previously existing solution. Essentially instead of controlling the concurrent requests per node, i would really like to control the overall number of concurrent requests against all nodes.
