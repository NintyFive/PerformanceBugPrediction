In the service configuration `bin/elasticsearch` is told to fork and to provide a PID file. Both is unnecessary when systemd is available (see http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd-for-admins-3.html). Part of the intention to write systemd in the first place was to move daemonizing / PID handling complexity from start scripts into the init service. So `src/rpm/systemd/elasticsearch.service` can be simplified quite a bit.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/65403891","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8636#issuecomment-65403891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8636","id":65403891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDAzODkx","user":{"login":"t-lo","id":71888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/71888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-lo","html_url":"https://github.com/t-lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-lo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-03T13:07:40Z","updated_at":"2014-12-03T13:07:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Changes are implemented, tested w/ Fedora 21, works as expected.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/112692551","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8636#issuecomment-112692551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8636","id":112692551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjY5MjU1MQ==","user":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-17T07:29:38Z","updated_at":"2015-06-17T07:29:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for reporting and your contribution.\n\nI agree with @t-lo it should be `network-online.target` and it how it is configured now (see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/packaging/common/systemd/elasticsearch.service).
