Basically we need to be able do an aggregation but limit the results of the query based on the value of the aggregation.  For example if I wanted to look at what age bands have an average height greater that 5 feet, my query would look something like this:\n\n```\n \"aggs\": {\n        \"genders\": {\n            \"terms\": {\n                \"field\": \"gender\"\n            },\n            \"aggs\": {\n                \"age_groups\" : {\n                    \"range\" : {\n                        \"field\" : \"age\",\n                        \"ranges\" : [\n                            { \"to\" : 5 },\n                            { \"from\" : 5, \"to\" : 10 },\n                            { \"from\" : 10, \"to\" : 15 },\n                            { \"from\" : 15}\n                        ]\n                    },\n                    \"aggs\" : {\n                        \"avg_height\" : { \n                            \"avg\" : { \"field\" : \"height\" } ,\n                            \"having\" : { \"from\" : 60 }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
