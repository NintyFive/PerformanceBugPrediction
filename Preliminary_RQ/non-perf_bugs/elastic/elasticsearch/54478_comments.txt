However, this particular API does not even need the \"size\" parameter, since there is nothing that would be impacted by it. So I will remove the \"size\" from the cat.thread_pool spec. \r\n\r\nNote - All _cat api's accept the \"size\" param and won't error, but will only get used if the value added to a column has internal type \"SizeValue\". This API is not backed by any \"SizeValue\". (The queueSize is close, but it converts to a long before it returned.)\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nThe default display value for any SizeValue is the human readable version, e.g. 1.3k. The only way to get a \"SizeValue\" to show the raw form e.g. 1312 in a cat API is to use any empty string (a missing `=` value) in the param. A quick look at the code and we don't actually use this \"SizeValue\" for any of the cat APIs, so this is probably a moot point once I remove this remove this one. \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
