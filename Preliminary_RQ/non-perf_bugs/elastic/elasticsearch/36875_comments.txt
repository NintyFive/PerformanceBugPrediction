There is an active community there who will be able to assist you in sorting this out.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, you might want to read up on the [coerce](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/coerce.html) mapping parameter. \r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
