In my mind there are 2 types of scenario the user is going to need to be alerted to:\r\n1. There are indexes in the ERROR step - This isn't to do with a transition between phases but rather something has gone wrong on a specific step in the policy. I think for this one just highlighting that for all the indices using `policy_x` there are N indexes in the ERROR step (and maybe providing a list of those indices) is enough for the user to go digging to the source of the issue (first step would be to run the explain API on that index).\r\n2. There are indexes that are stuck on a particular step in the policy but have not errored - This can be due to a range of things including not being able to move shards in the allocate action because e.g. the disks on the target nodes are past the watermarks. In this instance its hard to see at a glance that there is a problem so maybe having an indication of how many indices for a policy have managed to go from hot->warm, warm->cold etc. would give an indication to the user something is wrong. The thinking being that the user will know how many indexes should transition between each phase per day. We could also just count the number of indices that have completed (got to the phase complete step) for each phase rather than doing this on the transitions themselves.\r\n\r\nThe potential problem with 2 is the assumption that the user knows how many transitions to expect. This works fine with daily indexes as you expect 1 index to be created per day and then its easy to reason about the transitions from there. With rollover this is harder because if the indexing load is spiky you may have 2 indexes created one day and then none for the next 3 days and then 1 more the day after. Reasoning about these kinds of workloads can be a lot harder.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to try to summarise the information we already have per index in the `phase_time`, `action_time` and `step_time` and try to highlight to the user the maximum time an index has been waiting in a step. It may be easier for users to reason about how long they expect actions to take than how many they expect to be done in a certain timeframe and this information may allow the user to spot problems more easily?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/430944065","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34578#issuecomment-430944065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34578","id":430944065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDk0NDA2NQ==","user":{"login":"yaronp68","id":1367657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjc2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1367657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68","html_url":"https://github.com/yaronp68","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaronp68/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-18T09:40:26Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T09:40:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@colings86 I really like the idea to use maximum step_time as an indicator for something going wrong and action_time for how slow an action might have taken (if I got it right)\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/430945399","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34578#issuecomment-430945399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34578","id":430945399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDk0NTM5OQ==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-18T09:44:43Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T09:44:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The main question I have is whether we want to have an index centric view into this (i.e., is my index managed OK?) or an ILM centric view (are all indices under ILM OK).

Not sure if this aggregation should be kept in the UI or available on the API though.

My only concern here is that the expected time to complete a phase is dependant on what actions the phase is doing, how big the index its performing the action on is, and the resources available to the cluster. Maybe having a set time of 2 hours is ok for most cases but it would be annoying for a user to be told something is wrong constantly when its just that the combination of allocate, shrink, and forcemerge on their cluster with their data volume takes over 2 hours.
