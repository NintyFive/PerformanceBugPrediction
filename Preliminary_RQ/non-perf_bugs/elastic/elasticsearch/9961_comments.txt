I am using ES 1.4.4 on Ubuntu 14.04 using the official ES deb package. \nHere is the config file with which I can reproduce the problem : https://gist.github.com/setaou/7a65a242251f897aab35 .\n\nAfter testing on a vanilla install with this config file and a very simple index (the example at https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch#indexing), I discovered that the problem seems to affect more than just translogs. Here is the listing of files after the indexing: https://gist.github.com/setaou/7ca4f2b8abdcae55b8de . I suppose this did not appear on my previous setup because /data/ partitions had a lot more free space than /var/lib, so segments were only stored on /data/.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/162239245","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9961#issuecomment-162239245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9961","id":162239245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjIzOTI0NQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-05T19:26:03Z","updated_at":"2015-12-05T19:26:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm unable to replicate this.
