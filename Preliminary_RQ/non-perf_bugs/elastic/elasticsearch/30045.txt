Using the rollover API, we could more easily specify a reasonable target number of docs that, when exceeded, would cause a new index to be created.\r\n\r\nUsing the rollover API does have the drawback in that it is less efficient to maintain a fixed history duration, so we'd need to decide if we were comfortable with delete-by-query before undertaking this. \n\n","closed_by":{"login":"jakelandis","id":976291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjI5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/976291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis","html_url":"https://github.com/jakelandis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
