The same list is used upon master lost and election start.\n\nIt has been long requested to be able to update this list via an API. That presented a challenge since, unlike other setting changes, this information can not be easily serialized in the cluster state as it needs to be used when the node, for example, is restarted.\n\nAn alternative is for us to develop a plugin that, similarly to the current EC2 discovery plugin, monitors a separate (configurable) file and supplies the list of port/ips stored in it when needed (i.e., when pinging starts).\n\nThe format for the file should be simple and contain one hostname/ip per line (in the same format the current yml file supports).\n","closed_by":{"login":"abeyad","id":1631297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzEyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1631297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad","html_url":"https://github.com/abeyad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
