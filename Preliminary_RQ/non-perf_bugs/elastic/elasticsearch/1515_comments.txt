am not sure that log4j was popular any more. \nie some talk thread found on google\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/4165558/best-practices-for-using-markers-in-slf4j-logback\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/178836/should-new-projects-use-logback-instead-of-log4j\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/178215/log4j-vs-logback\n\nFor me I switch to logback 3 years ago, http://logback.qos.ch/reasonsToSwitch.html\nMainly because logback speaks SLF4J natively (so for performance issue, even I don't do a benchmark to proove it)\nand for some cool feature that I don't have in log4j\nCeki Gülcü, leave log4j project in order to refactor as logback.\nThe project log4j, seams to not have a lot of activity now, and for me is a deprecated project.\n\nBut is not very important the logger implementation that you or me prefer.\nThe point is that in the configuration (slf4j-api + logback + log4j-over-slf4j) I have a bug with your optimisation of logging directly in log4j with sl4f-api, when you call the method  Log4jESLogger.setLevel(Log4jESLogger.java:48.\nthat not available in my configuration.\n\nTo correct this bug,\n-  my preference go to rollback issue a83c45b, is appear to me more logic.\n  But another way, is to \n- find another way to detect log4j implementation\n- or to introduce a new parameter in ES configuration to force the one or another solution (Log4jESLoggerFactory or Slf4jESLoggerFactory)\n\nThis simple bug, is a blocking bug for me in order to introduce ES as search solution in the company framework.\n\nWhat solution do you prefer ?\n\nI could send you a small junit testing to reproduce the bug, if you think that was necessary

is it a blocking bug? You can work around it by setting the logging factory yourself to slf4j in your code. The mentioned change is not going to be rolled back because of the reason I gave you. I would say the problem is in slf4j that is not wrapping log4j properly. \n\nAnd, on the question of logging. I wish slf4j would never have happened, but it has, and people seem to use it, and good for them. logback is not BSD but LGPL, I am not going to rely on it in elasticsearch. Will do my best to help integrate with slf4j, but the ability to set the level is important (and lost with slf4j) since it allows to dynamically set, in runtime, logging level through an
