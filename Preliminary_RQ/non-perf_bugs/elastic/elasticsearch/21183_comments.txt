For example, do you have `JAVA_HOME` set properly?\n\nSince Elastic reserves GitHub for verified bug reports and feature requests, I'm going to close this issue and direct you to the [Elastic Discourse forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) which is provided for support for general end-user questions.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
