If both `user_dictionary` and `user_dictionary_entries` given, then it has to either merge both inputs or use only one of them though, I think simply prioritize one of those inputs would be simpler. This is actually pretty similar to the way the [Synonym Token Filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-synonym-tokenfilter.html) supports already.\r\n\r\nSo the new json format would be:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"index\": {\r\n      \"analysis\": {\r\n        \"tokenizer\": {\r\n          \"kuromoji_user_dict\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"kuromoji_tokenizer\",\r\n            \"mode\": \"extended\",\r\n            \"discard_punctuation\": \"false\",\r\n            \"user_dictionary_entires\": [\r\n              \"東京スカイツリー,東京 スカイツリー,トウキョウ スカイツリー,カスタム名詞\",\r\n              \"...\"\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"analyzer\": {\r\n          \"my_analyzer\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"custom\",\r\n            \"tokenizer\": \"kuromoji_user_dict\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this sounds good to you, I can create a pull request anytime.
