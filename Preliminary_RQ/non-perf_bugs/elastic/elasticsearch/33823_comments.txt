If you define the index settings as follows, the test works fine:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        createIndex(INDEX_NAME,\r\n            Settings.builder()\r\n                .put(\"number_of_shards\", 1)\r\n                .put(\"number_of_replicas\", 0)\r\n                .put(Store.INDEX_STORE_STATS_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SETTING.getKey(), 0)\r\n                .build());\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have further questions, we also have a [community forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/) and usually use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. Thank you!\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
