Currently, the logic is aggressively removing objects where all the fields has been removed, trying to make things as compact as possible. For example, consider the following document:\n\n```\n{\n    obj: { f: 1 }\n}\n```\n\nusing `exclude=['obj.f']`, will return `{}` because the `obj` now becomes empty. However, the same `exclude=['obj.f']` will return `{ obj : { d : 1 }` if the original document is:\n\n```\n{\n    obj: { f: 1, d :1 }\n}\n```\n\nThis causes client code interested in `obj.d` to need to always have to test whether `obj` is there before checking if `obj.d` exists. This can be cumbersome but also is not expected as the `obj.f` was excluded but not `obj`\n\nThis should change and only remove objects if they explicitly match an exclude (like `exclude=['obj']`), maintaining the object structure.\n","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
