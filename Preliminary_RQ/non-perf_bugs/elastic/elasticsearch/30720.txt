In the documentation ([here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/zip-windows.html#windows-service-settings)) says that there are 2 ways of configuring the service (by means of `set` command or system properties). Due to the fact that I don't want to interfere with other applications that may use  `JAVA_HOME` system property I decided to set a CMD `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and install/start the service.\r\n\r\nThe `JAVA_HOME` system property is **NOT** defined since I want to make sure ElasticSearch uses the private JRE.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe service is properly installed and started by using the private JRE pointed by the `JAVA_HOME` CMD environment variable and ignoring the `JAVA_HOME` system property which may point to a non valid JRE.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n The service is properly installed, however it cannot be started.\r\n\r\n`C:\\elasticsearch-6.2.4\\bin>elasticsearch-service.bat start`\r\n`Failed starting 'elasticsearch-service-x64' service`\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Open CMD window at `elasticsearch-6.2.4\\bin`\r\n2. Define `JAVA_HOME` CMD envvar pointing to a private JRE `set JAVA_HOME=C:\\elasticsearch-6.2.4\\jre`\r\n3. Install service `elasticsearch-service.bat install`\r\n4. Start service `>elasticsearch-service.bat start`\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\nelasticsearch-service-x64.2018-05-18.log\r\n\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:28] [info]  [ 6908] Commons Daemon procrun (1.0.15.0 64-bit) started`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:28] [info]  [ 6908] Service elasticsearch-service-x64 name Elasticsearch 6.2.4 (elasticsearch-service-x64)`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:28] [info]  [ 6908] Service 'elasticsearch-service-x64' installed`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:28] [info]  [ 6908] Commons Daemon procrun finished`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [info]  [ 6352] Commons Daemon procrun (1.0.15.0 64-bit) started`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [info]  [ 6352] Starting service 'elasticsearch-service-x64' ...`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [info]  [17032] Commons Daemon procrun (1.0.15.0 64-bit) started`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [info]  [17032] Running 'elasticsearch-service-x64' Service...`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [info]  [10696] Starting service...`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [error] [10696] Failed creating java %JAVA_HOME%\\bin\\server\\jvm.dll`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [error] [10696] The system cannot find the path specified.`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [error] [10696] ServiceStart returned 1`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [error] [10696] The system cannot find the path specified.`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [info]  [17032] Run service finished.`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:39] [info]  [17032] Commons Daemon procrun finished`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:40] [error] [ 6352] Failed to start 'elasticsearch-service-x64' service`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:40] [error] [ 6352] The data area passed to a system call is too small.`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:40] [info]  [ 6352] Start service finished.`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:40] [error] [ 6352] Commons Daemon procrun failed with exit value: 5 (Failed to start service)`\r\n`[2018-05-18 14:15:40] [error] [ 6352] The data area passed to a system call is too small.`\r\n\r\nelasticsearch-service-x64-stderr.2018-05-18.log\r\n\r\n`2018-05-18 14:15:39 Commons Daemon procrun stderr initialized`\r\n`The data area passed to a system call is too small.`\r\n`Failed to start service`\r\n\r\nelasticsearch-service-x64-stdout.2018-05-18.log\r\n\r\n`2018-05-18 14:15:39 Commons Daemon procrun stdout initialized`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
