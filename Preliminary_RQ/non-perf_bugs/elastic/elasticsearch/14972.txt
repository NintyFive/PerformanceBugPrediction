I think we should try to reduce this in general. I know we can improve it, since for example qa/smoke-test-plugins no longer has a hardcoded list and instead just \"includes all plugins\".\n\nThere are a few other places with this redundancy too: the help file for pluginmanager, also one of its tests has the same list of plugins and we should think about those too.\n\nAs far as the bats test goes, one trick i see is that it needs to behave differently if the plugin is just a site plugin.\n","closed_by":{"login":"hub-cap","id":613352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzM1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/613352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap","html_url":"https://github.com/hub-cap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
