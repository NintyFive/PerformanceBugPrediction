The default value is either the bucket span for short bucket spans, or, for longer bucket spans, a sensible fraction of the bucket span. For example: 150s.   When `query_delay` is present, queries run at `query_delay` after the end of each `frequency`.   When `frequency` is shorter than the associated job's `bucket_span`, interim results for the last (partial) bucket are written, and then overwritten by the full bucket results eventually.\r\n\r\nEDIT:  Added relationship to `bucket_span` also\r\n\r\n⬆️ cc @droberts195 let me know if i've got that right ⬆️ ","closed_by":{"login":"szabosteve","id":22324794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzI0Nzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22324794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve","html_url":"https://github.com/szabosteve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
