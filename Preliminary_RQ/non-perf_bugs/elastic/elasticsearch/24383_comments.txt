Although it doesn't yield unique buckets as a response \r\nIt still does the job, however, when it comes to filtering, the task gets complicated. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's assume I've got the following data:\r\n\r\n1 - 2016/01/12 - Peter\r\n2 - 2013/05/22 - Charles\r\n3 - 2005/07/11 - Mary\r\n4 - 1999/11/09 - Jerry\r\n5 - 1997/09/30 - Charles\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were to aggregate this data and filter as following:\r\n\r\n      A) Only the \"Monday's\" and \"Thursday's\"\r\n      B) Regardless the year, month or day\r\n      C) With time zone support\r\n\r\nI'm able to simply run this query:\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"size\": 0,\r\n  \"aggs\": {\r\n    \"groupby\": {\r\n      \"terms\": {\r\n        \"script\": {\r\n          \"inline\": \"ZonedDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.ofEpochMilli(doc['LAST_MODIFIED_DATE'].value), ZoneId.of('+05:00')).getDayOfWeek()\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"bool\": {\r\n      \"filter\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"script\": {\r\n            \"script\": {\r\n              \"inline\": \" (ZonedDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.ofEpochMilli(doc['LAST_MODIFIED_DATE'].value), ZoneId.of('+05:00')).getDayOfWeek() == DayOfWeek.TUESDAY)  || (ZonedDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.ofEpochMilli(doc['LAST_MODIFIED_DATE'].value), ZoneId.of('+05:00')).getDayOfWeek() == DayOfWeek.THURSDAY) \"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no way to achieve this for  \"Quarter\" and \"Week of the Year\" and\"Day Of Month\".
