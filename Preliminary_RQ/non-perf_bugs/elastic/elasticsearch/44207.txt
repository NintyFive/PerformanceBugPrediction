time to time users run into problems where they have a realm setting in their keystore, but not in their yml (e.g. a password for an LDAP bind user,  an SSL key) \r\nThis could be because they failed to remove it from the keystore when they decommission a realm, or because they had a typo of some form, and the realm name in the keystore does not match the realm name in their yml.\r\n\r\nThis will fail in some way, but usually not an obvious way.\r\nIt would be simplest to just enforce that keystore-only realms are invalid, and reject that with a clear error message rather than waiting for something else to fail.","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
