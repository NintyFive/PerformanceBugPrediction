was able to reproduce this via Eclipse only (it seems gradle won't let me pass the same in the command line) by passing `-Duser.timezone=UTC` to the VM starting the test. The way the test does the UTC timezone comparison is a bit different than what the Watcher code does it:\r\n\r\n- the test goes straight to `java.util.TimeZone.getDefault()`\r\n- Watcher code uses `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forTimeZone(null)` which first looks at `user.timezone` system property and, if that one doesn't exist, it takes the timezone from `TimeZone.getDefault()`.\r\n\r\nNot sure how would this scenario reach this stage so that the comparison fails... somehow `user.timezone` must have been set on the box the test ran in which made the test to fail...\r\n\r\n@spinscale @rjernst my investigation above does sound right to you?
