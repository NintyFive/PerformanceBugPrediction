Curator moves on to the next action in its chain, so long as the target index exists, irrespective of whether the reindex was actually complete.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful, and hopefully not just for Curator, to be able to identify Task IDs which were cancelled, even if only for a time (1 hour, 1 day, user determined...).  This metadata might identify cancelled tasks, what time they were cancelled, and if x-pack was installed/active, which user issued the cancellation call.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"untergeek","id":1020383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAzODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1020383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/untergeek","html_url":"https://github.com/untergeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untergeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untergeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untergeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untergeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untergeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untergeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untergeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untergeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untergeek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
