It would be much better if we had it stored as compressed, but in SMILE format, that will be much more storage efficient.\n\nI think it would make sense to create a `CompressedXContent` class, that would store internally the content compressed as bytes (based on a specific content type if needed). Then, we can use it, in SMILE format, to store the mapping. Also, `CompressedXContent` can include helper methods to convert to json and so on (that can make use of the XContentHelper classes).\n\nLast, for very large mappings, we can have a paged bytes instead of a single byte array in the `CompressedXContent` class.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
