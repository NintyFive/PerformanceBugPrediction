But from the point of view of caching the queries, a `bool` with nested `bool` in it has a slight advantage in that individual `bool` queries are cached individually, thus if the same `bool` is \"reused\" in a different query, it can be used from cache.\r\n\r\nThe other approach - a single big `bool` with an array of `filter` statements - will theoretically be the single query to cache. If the `filter`s in it change just slightly in a new \"similar\" query, the big `bool` cached query will not be reused.\r\n\r\nI am still in favor of a more visually pleasant Elasticsearch query translation, though. For users migrating from SQL world to Elasticsearch, the `translate` feature does help, imo, make the migration easier.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/389860838","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30019#issuecomment-389860838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30019","id":389860838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTg2MDgzOA==","user":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-17T13:11:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T13:11:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fixed by #30267","performed_via_github_app":null}]
