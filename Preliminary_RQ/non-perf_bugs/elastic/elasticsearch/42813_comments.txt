I agree that we should use the ES query cache in the searcher that is used for nested sort filter. \r\n\r\n> The problem seems to originate in v5.x. I can submit a PR later today with the proposed fix, but would request a backport to v6.x (ideally, v6.4.x) specifically since that's what we're currently building against (not sure what the procedure is for backported fixes).\r\n\r\nThanks and please open a pr on master first so that we can backport afterward. However we release only patch version in 6x so 6.4.x won't be possible but we can discuss whether we should backport to 6.8.x (the latest version in this major) when the fix is ready.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/499256565","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42813#issuecomment-499256565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42813","id":499256565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTI1NjU2NQ==","user":{"login":"henryptung","id":1700335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDAzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1700335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryptung","html_url":"https://github.com/henryptung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryptung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryptung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryptung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryptung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryptung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryptung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryptung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryptung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryptung/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-05T21:09:18Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T21:38:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jimczi ~~Hey, so there are some delays on my end regarding CLA stuff, but would it be possible for you or an ES dev to make the change instead?
