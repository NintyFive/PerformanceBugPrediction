is possible for a null pointer to happen when using a named query when you also have nested docs (seen on 1.4.3, I can't reproduce on 2.1.1 but given the number of things that have to be in place to reproduce I can't be that confident that it doesn't exist somewhere in the latest version).\n\nA script to reproduce it can be found here: https://gist.github.com/tstibbs/92de2206531ca37e0764\n\nThe last command in the gist is a search request that should result in a null pointer, I see something like the following in the logs:\n\n```\n[2016-01-12 16:51:30,174][DEBUG][action.search.type       ]

Fox] All shards failed for phase: [query_fetch]\n```\n\nI'm not sure if everything in the script is strictly required, but the following three things all seem to be required in order to reproduce it:\n- A large number of (possibly empty) documents – see org.apache.lucene.search.ConstantScoreAutoRewrite:91.\n- Multiple matching docs on the same shard.\n- Multiple matching documents that have nested children – the nested docs cause issues in [MatchedQueriesFetchSubPhase](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/1.4/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/fetch/matchedqueries/MatchedQueriesFetchSubPhase.java#L108) where the filterIterator can be advanced beyond NO_MORE_DOCS (I’m not sure if that’s allowed or not, but the org.apache.lucene.search.DisjunctionScorer.advance method assumes it isn’t).\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
