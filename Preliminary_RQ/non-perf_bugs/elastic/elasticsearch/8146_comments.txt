I think the `ClusterInfoService` should be entirely separated from the internals of shard allocation, its job should only be to gather information and make it available as needed. This makes it a bit easier to use for other purposes in the future where we may need to gather information (and not operation on it at all) at specific intervals.\n\nI think a better way to implement it would be to allow the `ClusterInfoService` to register listeners that are called when new information is gathered, then we could register a standalone handler that was responsible for knowing about the high watermark and kicking off the reroute when necessary.\n\nWhat do you think about this?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/59975764","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8146#issuecomment-59975764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8146","id":59975764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTc1NzY0","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-21T18:35:45Z","updated_at":"2014-10-21T18:35:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yeah I think that is the right way to do it abstraction wise...\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
