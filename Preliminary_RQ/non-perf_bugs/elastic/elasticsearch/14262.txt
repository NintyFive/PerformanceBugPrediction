[Example](https://www.dropbox.com/s/op3kzha6qwjlbpe/Screenshot%202015-10-23%2014.08.17.png?dl=0). This seems to be caused by Kibana including both the field and script property. It is not possible to exclude the field property from Kibana.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity I narrowed this down to a plain simple ES query. Elasticsearch 1.7.3 on a bare CentOS 7.1 box installed using the yum repo. No changes have been made to the ES config.\n\nBe sure to have one document in an index with a numerical field.\n\n```\n$ curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/test\n\n$ curl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/test/1?pretty=true -d '{\n    \"metric\": 100\n}'\n\n{\n  \"_index\" : \"test\",\n  \"_type\" : \"test\",\n  \"_id\" : \"1\",\n  \"_version\" : 1,\n  \"created\" : true\n}\n```\n\nMapping has become a long value, which is fine for percentile agg\n\n```\n$ curl -XGET localhost:9200/test/_mapping?pretty=true\n\n{\n  \"test\" : {\n    \"mappings\" : {\n      \"test\" : {\n        \"properties\" : {\n          \"metric\" : {\n            \"type\" : \"long\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRunning a query with both the field and script properties supplied. Results in a NullPointerException.
