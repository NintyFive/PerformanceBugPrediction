To configure the `synonyms_path` requires a direct control of the Elasticsearch cluster, which is not always possible when using shared hosts, for example.\r\n\r\nThis leaves that we configure the token filter inline using the `synonyms` option instead, which the docs suggest [(docs)][1] could increase the cluster size unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nIn this feature request, I'm requesting a third option, `synonyms_url` to be defined, which should load the synonyms file from the `url`, instead of filesystem. This would allow us to configure this even when we can't copy the synonyms file in `config` directory.\r\n\r\nI am willing to contribute this feature, if it is considered relevant. I think the patch would be in `analysis/Analysis.java` [(file)][2].\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-synonym-tokenfilter.html\r\n[2]: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/analysis/Analysis.java#L235","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
