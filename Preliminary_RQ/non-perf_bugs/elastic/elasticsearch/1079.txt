By default, a node can be elected to become master in a cluster unless `node.master` is set to `false`.\n\nAdd `zen.discovery.minimum_master_nodes` setting, controlling how many total master nodes (a node can be explicitly set to be, or not to be, a master node) should be in the cluster a specific node \"sees\". Below this number, the relevant node will get back into trying to form a cluster with enough master nodes. A cluster will not be formed if a node does not see `minimum_master_node` or above.\n\nFor example, in a 5 node cluster, one can set the `minimum_master_nodes` to 3, meaning that if a network disconnection happens of a node (or 2), then they will not form their own cluster, but instead, get back into trying to join the bigger cluster.\n\nThis can also help in a cluster where there are specific master nodes (lets say 3), and the rest are just data nodes (non master). Setting then the `minimum_master_nodes` to 2 can help with the master nodes not forming their own cluster, and the data nodes making sure they are connected to at least 2 master nodes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
