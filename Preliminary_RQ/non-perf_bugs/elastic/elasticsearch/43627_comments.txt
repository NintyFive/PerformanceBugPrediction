In addition to the one you linked, there is also https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker/issues/75. While we understand the desire, we believe production should be tied to a specific version of Elasticsearch due to the many concerns in how upgrades must be handled. Transitively, any testing of a product against Elasticsearch should likewise test a specific version since that version would then presumably be deployed to production.\r\n\r\nGive that our stance has not changed, I hope you don't mind that I close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/526370748","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43627#issuecomment-526370748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43627","id":526370748,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjM3MDc0OA==","user":{"login":"teohhanhui","id":548843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODg0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/548843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui","html_url":"https://github.com/teohhanhui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T21:32:31Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T21:32:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rjernst That argument makes no sense.
