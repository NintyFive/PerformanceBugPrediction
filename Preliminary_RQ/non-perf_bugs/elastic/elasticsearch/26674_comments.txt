is \"interesting\" since we recently moved some mappers including `scaled_float` to a module in order to avoid introducing dependencies between the mapping API and specific implementations while this bug would require such a dependency to be fixed.\r\n\r\nFor the record, this bug only exists in multi-type setups so it can't affect 6.0+ indices, which disallow the use of multiple types.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could fix it without a compile-time dependency on `ScaledFloatFieldMapper` by adding a case to the switch statement that would do something like that:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n            case \"scaled_float\": // this is the only added line, below is handling for double, which scaled_float can share\r\n            case \"double\":\r\n                builder = context.root().findTemplateBuilder(context, currentFieldName, \"double\", XContentFieldType.DOUBLE);\r\n                break;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way it should at least work in the case that the field is defined in templates.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/360140552","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26674#issuecomment-360140552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26674","id":360140552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDE0MDU1Mg==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-24T13:50:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T13:50:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
