Also, I wonder why good defaults are not set, or even where there is a discussion about these settings.\r\n\r\nHeap size is up to your use case, stack size is configured by default now assuming a 64-bit platform. You can change these in the [jvm.options file](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/setting-system-settings.html#jvm-options) and the [docs cover the case of setting the heap size](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/heap-size.html).\r\n\r\nBeyond this, Elastic provides a [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) for asking general questions and instead prefers to use GitHub only for verified bug reports and feature requests. There's an active community there that should be able to help get an answer to any follow up questions.

Elasticsearch works fine when running from the console. However, running from a service was failing.  I have to use Elasticsearch 2.4.1 with a private JRE not a system JRE.

One error that led me to a solution was the following:\r\n\r\n> Exception in thread \"main\" tion: path.home is not configured\" in the stderr log file. \r\n\r\nI debugged the service.bat execution and noticed a line where it was setting the %ES_PARAMS% variable. For some reason, none of the -D options set in this variable was showing in the Java options of  the Windows service.
