If you have a question or an unconfirmed bug , please\r\nvisit the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).  Please also\r\ncheck your OS is [supported](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#show_os).\r\nIf it is not, the issue is likely to be closed.\r\n\r\nFor security vulnerabilities please only send reports to security@elastic.co.\r\nSee https://www.elastic.co/community/security for more information.\r\n\r\nPlease fill in the following details to help us reproduce the bug:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): 7.7.0\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: [`repository-azure`, `repository-s3`]\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`): ESS\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system): ESS Azure\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nExecuting `GET /_nodes/stats?level=shards` responds with\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"root_cause\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n        \"reason\": \"Values less than -1 bytes are not supported: -8192b\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"type\": \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n    \"reason\": \"Values less than -1 bytes are not supported: -8192b\",\r\n    \"suppressed\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"illegal_state_exception\",\r\n        \"reason\": \"Failed to close the XContentBuilder\",\r\n        \"caused_by\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"i_o_exception\",\r\n          \"reason\": \"Unclosed object or array found\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"status\": 400\r\n}\r\n```\r\nExpect it to return 200 and node stats.
