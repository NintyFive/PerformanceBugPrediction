BWC on a java API level is difficult topic and if the changes are minor like this one or required we prefer a compile error over a compiler warning. Not everybody agrees with this but I personally like it much better if your compiler fails than a ignored deprecation warning. This is different for things like the JDK where you really don't know which one you are running on but with ES upgrades are explicit and fixes are straight forward.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
