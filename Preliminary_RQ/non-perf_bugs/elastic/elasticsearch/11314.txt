When the master node receives the command it queues cluster state update task and acknowledges the receipt of the command to the data node. \n\nThe update snapshot shard status tasks have relatively low priority, so during cluster instability they tend to get stuck at the end of the queue. If the master node gets restarted before processing these tasks the information about the shards can be lost and the new master assumes that they are still in process while the data node thinks that these shards are already done. \n\nThis might be the root cause of #9924 and #10564\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
