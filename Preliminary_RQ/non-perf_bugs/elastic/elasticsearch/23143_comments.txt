For errors, we already have an `errors: true`. Rally needed a slightly more subtle flag indicating that one of the replicas have failed. My idea was to merge all the _shards headers from the shard level bulk into a single shard header at the top of the bulk response. Rally can then look at those numbers and if total != successful it can report something didn't go as planned (if relevant).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/279736099","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23143#issuecomment-279736099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23143","id":279736099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTczNjA5OQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-14T15:19:07Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T15:19:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bleskes but would this be generally useful outside Rally?
