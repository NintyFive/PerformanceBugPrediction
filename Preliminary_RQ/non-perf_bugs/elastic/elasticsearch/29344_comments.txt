You could use a `multi_match` query and set the `type` to `phrase` but I agree that it would be nice to re-enable the support for `zero_terms_query` option in a simple `match_phrase` query. Would you like to work on a pull request for this issue @JFogh ? Otherwise I'll mark the issue with an adoptme tag.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/379661663","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29344#issuecomment-379661663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29344","id":379661663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTY2MTY2Mw==","user":{"login":"JFogh","id":38031312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDMxMzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/38031312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFogh","html_url":"https://github.com/JFogh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFogh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFogh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFogh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFogh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFogh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFogh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFogh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFogh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFogh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-09T07:34:53Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T07:34:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jimczi I do not think I will have time to look into it, in the near future - so maybe the \"adoptme\"-tag would be fine.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/379673996","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29344#issuecomment-379673996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29344","id":379673996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTY3Mzk5Ng==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-09T08:25:08Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T08:25:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok thanks @JFogh ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/382880262","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29344#issuecomment-382880262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29344","id":382880262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Mjg4MDI2Mg==","user":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-19T21:04:28Z","updated_at":"2018-04-19T21:04:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This functionality was added in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/29598.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
