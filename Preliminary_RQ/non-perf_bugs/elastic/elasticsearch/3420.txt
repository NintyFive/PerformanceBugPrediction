This can become even a bigger issue if percolate queries with the same id exist in different indices.\n\nFor this reason the response needs to be enhanced to include the concrete index per match:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"matches\" : [\n      {\n         \"id\" : \"1\",\n         \"_index\" : \"my-index1\"\n      },\n      ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe current format will still be supported by setting `percolate_format=ids` parameter in the query string. Useful in the case percolation is only executed on just one index.\n\nThis issue will also add support for specifying multiple indices in the percolate request:\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XGET 'localhost:9200/my-index1,my-index2/my-type/_percolate' -d '...'\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
