However, this is not a persistent task, only a node-specific task.  If the node running that task is shut down before the deletion completes then the job is left in a partially deleted state.\r\n\r\nOne option to fix this would be to make the deletion task a persistent task.  However, this is a huge amount of development work.\r\n\r\nA simpler alternative could be to have the nightly maintenance action check for jobs in the `deleting` state that don't have a corresponding deletion task, and start a new deletion task for them.","closed_by":{"login":"przemekwitek","id":19312454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzEyNDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19312454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek","html_url":"https://github.com/przemekwitek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/przemekwitek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
