We don't currently have any infrastructure in place to make sure that Elasticsearch behaves well if this happens. A node that cannot write to disk may be poisonous to the rest of the cluster:\r\n\r\n- a readonly master-eligible node repeatedly leaves and rejoins the cluster, and may trigger elections by offering a vote that it cannot give\r\n- a readonly data node may be assigned shards (e.g. due to rebalancing) which will then immediately fail (cf #18417). Any shards that are already assigned to the node may also eventually fail too (e.g. when syncing retention leases triggers some IO).\r\n\r\nThis issue is to improve Elasticsearch's behaviour when a node becomes readonly:\r\n\r\n- [x] verify that the data paths are writeable before joining a cluster\r\n- [x] verify that the data paths are writeable before offering a pre-vote\r\n- [x] periodically verify that data paths are writeable, and leave the cluster if they are not","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
