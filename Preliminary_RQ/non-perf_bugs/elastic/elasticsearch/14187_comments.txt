@lucidfrontier45 \n\nI am using ES 2.2/2.1 because that is only version compatible with Spark. Please correct me if i am wrong.\nNow the problem in my architecture is, for some of the data sources I am using ES in Flume sink so i installed ES 2.0 and use your custom sink. But for some of the data sources I have to use Spark as Flume sink because I have to do some data processing and then read the data from Spark to ES. Now in this case I can only use ES 2.2/2.1 (compatibility issues).\n\nSince no custom Flume sink of ES 2.2 is available. Is it possible to use ES 2.0 with Spark 1.6?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
