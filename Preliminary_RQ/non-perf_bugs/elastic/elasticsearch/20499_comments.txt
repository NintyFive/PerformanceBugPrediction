But when having thousands of customers with separate clusters in different time zones you will run into issues like this because someone messed up somewhere. That someone could easily do that same mistake on all nodes in the cluster, which will stop the entire cluster. Really bad if the cluster is a vital service. The issue does not appear when the file is created, it is discovered at a reboot/restart at a later time, possibly by someone without Elasticsearch knowledge, making trouble shooting harder. Responding to the issue by not starting the service on a trivial matter like an unknown file, which can easily be ignored, is really bad practice in my opinion. Much better to start the service and add some kind of warning to the cluster health status so that the problem can be investigated and fixed while the system is up and running fully.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/247344266","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20499#issuecomment-247344266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20499","id":247344266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzM0NDI2Ng==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-15T14:28:13Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T14:28:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hmanner I have a completely different opinion on this.
