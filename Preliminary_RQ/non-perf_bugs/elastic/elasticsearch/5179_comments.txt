It's caused when running a `histogram` or `date_histogram` on unmapped fields and then adding a sub-aggregation to them.\n\nIn the example above, even though you created a default mapping, you didn't actually index anything and no concrete mappings were created on the index. \n\nIn any case... I'll fix it soon...\n\nThx for reporting!\n\nps, you can remove the `\"index\" : \"not_analyzed\"` from the `timestamp` field... this setting only applies to `string` types\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/35702918","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5179#issuecomment-35702918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5179","id":35702918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzAyOTE4","user":{"login":"bsmid","id":2103074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDMwNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2103074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmid","html_url":"https://github.com/bsmid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-21T06:36:30Z","updated_at":"2014-02-21T06:36:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thx for fixing @uboness !\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
