This will save space for users that do not care or need the weighted centroid, and decouple the calculation such that it can be used as a subaggregation. This allows the weighted centroid to be calculated based on attributes besides just geolocation (e.g., weights based on population density or median household income)\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
