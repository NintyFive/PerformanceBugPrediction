Here is the test scenario:\n\nCreate an index with a type with all `custom.*` fields not analysed:\n\n```\nPUT /myindex\nPUT /myindex/mytype/_mapping\n{\n    \"mytype\": {\n        \"dynamic\" : false,\n        \"properties\" : {\n            \"custom\": {\n                \"dynamic\": true, \"type\": \"object\", \"include_in_all\": false\n            }\n        },\n        \"dynamic_templates\": [ {\n            \"custom_fields\": {\n                \"path_match\": \"custom.*\",\n                \"mapping\": {\n                    \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"\n                }\n            }\n        }]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen register two queries one matching docs with `color:red` and the other `color:blue`\n\n```\nPUT /myindex/.percolator/redperco\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"query_string\": {\n           \"query\": \"color:red\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nPUT /myindex/.percolator/blueperco\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"query_string\": {\n           \"query\": \"color:blue\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen percolate. Note that we did not insert any document in the index. It will be the first time it sees the `custom.color` field.\n\n```\nPOST /myindex/mytype/_percolate\n{\n    \"doc\" : {\n        \"custom\": {\n            \"color\": \"blue\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe get no match when it should find one.\n\nInteresting notes:\n- if you use the fully qualified field name `custom.color` in the queries it works\n- if you re-put the mapping and re-register the queries it works\n- if you index the same document before registering the queries it works\n\nTests run on OSX 10.9.2.\nElasticsearch Info:\n\n```\n{\n   \"status\": 200,\n   \"name\": \"Silver Fox\",\n   \"version\": {\n      \"number\": \"1.1.0\",\n      \"build_hash\": \"2181e113dea80b4a9e31e58e9686658a2d46e363\",\n      \"build_timestamp\": \"2014-03-25T15:59:51Z\",\n      \"build_snapshot\": false,\n      \"lucene_version\": \"4.7\"\n   },\n   \"tagline\": \"You Know, for Search\"\n}\n```\n\nThanks,\nEmmanuel\n","closed_by":{"login":"egueidan","id":1777027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzcwMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1777027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egueidan","html_url":"https://github.com/egueidan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egueidan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egueidan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egueidan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egueidan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egueidan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egueidan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egueidan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egueidan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egueidan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
