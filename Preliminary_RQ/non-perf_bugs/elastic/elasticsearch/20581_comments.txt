The `path_hierarchy` tokenizer should be used at indexing time but at query time you need to define another analyzer that would use your char filters and a _keyword_ tokenizer:\n\n```\n\"analyzer\": {\n          \"pathName_query\": {\n            \"filter\": \"lowercase\",\n            \"char_filter\": [\n              \"path\",\n              \"drop_leading_slash\",\n              \"drop_trailing_slash\"\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"custom\",\n            \"tokenizer\": \"keyword\"\n          },\n        },\n```\n\nThe `keyword` tokenizer is mandatory since you want to match only one term, for instance the query: \"http://www.animalfactguide.com/category/animal-news/page/\" will match the term \"www.animalfactguide.com/category/animal-news/page/6\" and that's all you want.\n That's how the path_hierarchy tokenizer is meant to be used; extra work at indexing time in order to speed up queries.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/248857759","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20581#issuecomment-248857759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20581","id":248857759,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODg1Nzc1OQ==","user":{"login":"vaughnd","id":715490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTQ5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/715490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaughnd","html_url":"https://github.com/vaughnd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaughnd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaughnd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaughnd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaughnd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaughnd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaughnd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaughnd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaughnd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vaughnd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-22T09:51:35Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T09:51:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ahh, thanks Jim!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
