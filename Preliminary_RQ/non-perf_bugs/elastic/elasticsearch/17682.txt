Each time we convert those to a named writeable we create new methods in StreamInput and StreamOutput to write those objects. The methods are really simple, like:\n\n``` java\n    public SuggestionBuilder<?> readSuggestion() throws IOException {\n        return readNamedWriteable(SuggestionBuilder.class);\n    }\n```\n\nSo, why do we make these methods rather than just use `readNamedWriteable` directly? I mean, now `readNamedWriteable` is protected so we **can't**. But why not just make it public?\n\nThe argument for keeping it protected is that it forces us to be intentional about each new named writable. You can't make a new type of NamedWriteable in a plugin because you'd have to modify StreamInput and StreamOutput.\n\nThe argument for making it public is that we can drop all of the `readFooBar` methods and StreamInput and StreamOutput no longer need to know about all of the classes that they are reading.\n\nSo let's discuss! Regardless of the outcome this issue will be closed by a PR - either one that makes the methods public or one that adds some javadoc summarizing the outcome of the conversation.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
