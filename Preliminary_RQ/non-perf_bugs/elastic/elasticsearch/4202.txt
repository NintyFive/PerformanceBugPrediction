This only occurs using an index alias, with the index name it works. This is the resulting exception in 0.90.7:\n\n```\nElasticSearchIllegalArgumentException: index/alias [parentid-testalias] provided with routing value [abc,2] that resolved to several routing values, rejecting operation\n    at org.elasticsearch.cluster.metadata.MetaData.resolveIndexRouting(MetaData.java:338)\n    at org.elasticsearch.action.index.IndexRequest.process(IndexRequest.java:557)\n    ...\n```\n\nHere is some code to reproduce the problem:\n\n```\nClient client = new TransportClient().addTransportAddress(new InetSocketTransportAddress(\"localhost\", 9300));\n\nString indexName = \"parentid-test\";\nString indexAlias = \"parentid-testalias\";\nif (client.admin().indices().exists(new IndicesExistsRequest(indexName)).actionGet().isExists()) {\n    client.admin().indices().delete(new DeleteIndexRequest(indexName)).actionGet();\n}\nCreateIndexRequest createIndexRequest = new CreateIndexRequest(indexName);\ncreateIndexRequest.mapping(\"chld\", \"{\\\"chld\\\":{\\\"_parent\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"prnt\\\"}}}\");\nclient.admin().indices().create(createIndexRequest).actionGet();\nclient.admin().indices().prepareAliases().addAlias(indexName, indexAlias).execute().actionGet();\n\nclient.prepareIndex(indexName, \"prnt\", \"abc,1\").setSource(\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"parent abc,1\\\"}\").execute().actionGet();\nclient.prepareIndex(indexName, \"chld\", \"def,1\").setParent(\"abc,1\").setSource(\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"child def,1\\\"}\").execute().actionGet();\n\nclient.prepareIndex(indexAlias, \"prnt\", \"abc,2\").setSource(\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"parent abc,2\\\"}\").execute().actionGet();\n// this causes the exception - indexAlias and comma in parent id\nclient.prepareIndex(indexAlias, \"chld\", \"def,2\").setParent(\"abc,2\").setSource(\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"child def,2\\\"}\").execute().actionGet();\n\nclient.close();\n```\n\nhttp://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-aliases.html tells me that this is intended behavior: \"...search routing may contain several values separated by comma. Index routing can contain only a single value.\"\n\nSo, if this is how it should be, then I would suggest to add some documentation on invalid characters in IDs, as I didn't find anything regarding this. Any suggestions?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
