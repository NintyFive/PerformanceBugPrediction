This meta issue aims to summarize the functionality we would like to add to the aggregations framework to allow different types of computation to be performed during the reduce phase of aggregations.\n\nThis set of new aggregations are the highest priority, given their utility in a wide range of scenarios:\n- [x] https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/9293 Aggregation to calculate the derivative on a histogram aggregation\n- [x] https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/10898 Derivative Aggregation x-axis units normalisation\n- [x] https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/10002 Aggregation to calculate multiple types of moving averages on a histogram aggregation \n- [x] https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/10000 Aggregation to calculate the bucket which has the maximum value in a given aggregation\n- [x] https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/9999 Aggregation to calculate the bucket which has the minimum value in a given aggregation\n\nAt the moment, the remainder of the list is largely explorative, to see which ideas/functionality makes sense and have community interest.
