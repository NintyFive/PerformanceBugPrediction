Click on the edit button and replace the `1.6` in the url with `master` and github will walk you through making a pull request. I hope.

Right now its doing all the highlighting on site search on wikipedia and is working fine. It had some interesting bugs at times but it gets lots of exercise so we found them and squashed them. Its newer than the other hihglighters and not as widely used so there are certainly some rough edges that we have yet to find though.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/118638895","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12013#issuecomment-118638895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12013","id":118638895,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODYzODg5NQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-05T17:14:22Z","updated_at":"2015-07-05T17:14:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Ping @clintongormley - that link isn't working properly.
