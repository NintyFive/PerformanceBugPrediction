When a slow log entry is attempted to be logged I get the following unhelpful errors:\n\n```\nlog4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (index.search.slowlog.query).\nlog4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.\nlog4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.\nlog4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (index.search.slowlog.query).\nlog4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.\nlog4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.\n```\n\n For our handling of slow logs, the above lines don't really make sense, but it appears to trip users up, see #7461.  \n\nIt doesn't look like we do any syntax checking or warn when a user adds logging configuration that could break our abstraction.
