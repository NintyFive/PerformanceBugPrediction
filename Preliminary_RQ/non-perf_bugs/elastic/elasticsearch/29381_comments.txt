It would be a new concept to have an alias point to something that is not locally present, it would mean storing aliases differently in the cluster state. Not saying it's not possible, but it's quite a change compared to how aliases are currently handled.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, when we implemented Cross Cluster Search we consciously went for addressing the hard problem, namely search across multiple clusters, which couldn't be handled on the client side. \r\nFor this reason we only added the cross-cluster execution to the search API only.  I don't think we want to add support for remote calls to external clusters in other API, especially to solve problems like mapping an alias to an index, which can be easily done on the client side.\r\n\r\nAlso we didn't want to abstract remote calls away, rather have users consciously query remote clusters by adding their name as part of the index. Creating an alias to a remote index would mean that users don't know anymore whether they are querying a remote index or not, which seems dangerous to me.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
