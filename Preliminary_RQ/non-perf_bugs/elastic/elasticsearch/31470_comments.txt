There are a number of technical challenges there that we not yet ready to complicate plugins with.\r\n\r\nUpdating the installed plugins via the cli is not feasible, currently, because we do not maintain any information about where the plugin was installed from. To elasticsearch, plugins are all the same: subdirectories in the plugins directory. This would be a large change (needing to keep additional metadata about the plugin, and would also only work with official plugins). Similar to rpm/deb packages for plugins, we are not yet ready to bear this burden, as the need for it has not come up often enough.\r\n\r\nFinally, in regards to loosening the version checks: this has been discussed many times since the strict checking was first added in Elasticsearch 2.0. It is something we very much want to do, but will not do it until there is a stable and separate plugin API. Currently, the plugin api relies heavily on internal classes that may change at any time, in any version (including bug fix versions). Before 2.0, these types of changes could cause subtle bugs or horrible upgrade problems.  We are working towards a stable plugin api, but it is a very long process that involves cleanly separating out each plugin api, once at a time.\r\n\r\nGiven that none of these are immediate priorities, I am going to close this issue. Note that the stable plugin api is something a number of as have been slowly working towards, but given the complexities involved, I don't see this happening for quite a while.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/422846252","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31470#issuecomment-422846252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31470","id":422846252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjg0NjI1Mg==","user":{"login":"stof","id":439401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTQwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/439401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof","html_url":"https://github.com/stof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-19T15:25:40Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T15:25:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In the meantime, I created a script that I can run to easily reinstall the plugins I need (tested only with core plugins): https://gist.github.com/stof/9fc74662a4a50a6c1e67a996c7debb2c","performed_via_github_app":null}]
