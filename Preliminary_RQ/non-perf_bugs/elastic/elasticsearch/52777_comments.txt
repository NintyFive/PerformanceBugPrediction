Currently numeric fields are indexed only in BKD trees and docValues, and for these data structures `index_options` are not applicable.  Not sure, why `geo_point` or `ranges` use `positions` as the default value, as `index_options` are not applicable to them either. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
