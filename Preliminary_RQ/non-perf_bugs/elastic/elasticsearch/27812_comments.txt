Also note that version 1.7.5 has been \"End of Life\" for quite a while now and is unsupported. If you are installing the Elastic stack I would suggest you install a recent, supported version. You can find instructions on installing the components of the Elastic stack at https://www.elastic.co/downloads.\r\n\r\nGiven this is not an issue with Elasticsearch I am going to close this. I would advise you to ask questions like this on the forums `https://discuss.elastic.co`.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
