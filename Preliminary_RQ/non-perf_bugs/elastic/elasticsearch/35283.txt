Sorry if this is already supported or I missed something obvious. I'm pretty new to Elasticsearch. I looked at [the docs here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html) and I didn't see it mentioned.\r\n\r\nI find administration a lot simpler when I can configure services that aren't supposed to be exposed publicly to listen on unix domain sockets instead of TCP ports.\r\n\r\nBenefits include:\r\n- Security is easier because access can be restricted simply by setting file permissions.\r\n- I have read that performance is better.\r\n- Probably others I haven't thought of.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a common need in the Elastic community.
