to: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/9910\n\nIf you use JSON string as the query and set it by calling `setSource()` method, before executing the query if you call `requestBuilder.toString()` and then execute the query, you will get incorrect response, because `toString()` modified the internal state of `SearchRequestBuilder` object.\n\nTry this code:\n\n```\n@GrabResolver(name='maven', root='http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/')\n@Grab(group='org.elasticsearch', module='elasticsearch', version='1.4.4')\nimport org.elasticsearch.common.settings.Settings\nimport org.elasticsearch.common.settings.ImmutableSettings\nimport org.elasticsearch.common.transport.InetSocketTransportAddress\nimport org.elasticsearch.client.Client\nimport org.elasticsearch.client.transport.TransportClient\nimport org.elasticsearch.action.index.IndexRequestBuilder\nimport org.elasticsearch.action.index.IndexResponse\nimport org.elasticsearch.action.search.SearchRequestBuilder\nimport org.elasticsearch.action.search.SearchResponse\n\nSettings settings = ImmutableSettings.settingsBuilder().put(\"cluster.name\", \"elasticsearch\").build();\nClient client = new TransportClient(settings).addTransportAddress(new InetSocketTransportAddress(\"localhost\", 9300));\n\n[1,2,3,4].each() {\n    String body = \"\"\"{\"name\":\"Hello world ${it}\"}\"\"\"\n    IndexRequestBuilder indexRequestBuilder = new IndexRequestBuilder(client, \"twitter\")\n            .setType(\"data\")\n            .setId(it.toString())\n            .setSource(body)\n            .setRefresh(true)\n    IndexResponse indexResponse = indexRequestBuilder.execute().actionGet()\n}\n\nString jsonQuery = \"\"\"{\"query\":{\"filtered\":{\"filter\":{\"term\":{\"_id\":\"1\"}}}}}\"\"\"\nSearchRequestBuilder requestBuilder = client.prepareSearch(\"twitter\")\n            .setTypes(\"data\")\n            .setSource(jsonQuery)\n\n// This is the bug\nprintln requestBuilder.toString()\n\nSearchResponse response = requestBuilder.execute().actionGet()\nprintln response.toString()\n```\n\nThe expected response is one document with `id=1`, however, the actual response is all documents inside the index.\n\nBut if you remove the bug line, the response will be correct.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
