Some of its complaints are legit, others not so much.\n\nFor instance, take Apache Derby. The Derby build contains three jars (ignoring tools), all of which have some overlapping classes with the others but none of which are a strict superset of any other. (Like a Venn diagram, I guess.) We use two of these in our desktop application and three of them in the server application.\n\nThe JarHell check chokes on these, making it impossible to use both Derby and Elasticsearch in the same application.\n\nI found a ticket over at Derby about extracting a \"core\" jar with common code, but even though that ticket was created a decade ago, it doesn't look like any work has begun. For completeness, I will file it here as well, as I notice that there are exceptions for some other libraries (e.g. log4j), so I guess adding exceptions for individual libraries does not appear to be out of the question.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
