Multi-fields are equivalent to a copy field, they take the input of their parent and index it with the associated type. \r\nYour script tries to add a field inside a leaf field (`item.name`), that's why you get the IAE, you cannot change a string into an object automatically. \r\nSo the solution if you add a new multi-field is to simply reindex the document, you don't need to change the `_source`, the multi-field will be populated when documents are reindexed (using reindex or a simple update).\r\nI hope you don't mind if I close this issue, please use the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch/6) if you have further questions on the topic since we reserve github for bugs and feature requests.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
