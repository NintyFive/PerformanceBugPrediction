In general field aliases are supported in ES-SQL (and are regarded in the same way `_field_caps` regards them - normal fields), but there are some scenarios where these don't work.\r\n\r\nFor the following mapping:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"doc\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"foo_alias\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"alias\",\r\n          \"path\": \"parent.foo\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"parent\": {\r\n          \"properties\": {\r\n            \"foo\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"keyword\",\r\n              \"ignore_above\": 1024\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"nested.foo_alias\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"alias\",\r\n          \"path\": \"parent.foo\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"nested\": {\r\n          \"properties\": {\r\n            \"foo_alias\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"alias\",\r\n              \"path\": \"parent.foo\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth `nested.foo_alias` and `nested`->`foo_alias` alias fields will fail in ES-SQL. The reason is that when index resolution happens, when SQL tries to add `foo_alias` to the `nested` field, this doesn't exist and an exception will be thrown \r\n\r\n```\r\nServer error [Server encountered an error [Cannot find field nested; this is likely a bug].
