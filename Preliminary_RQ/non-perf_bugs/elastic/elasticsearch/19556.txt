up discussion at https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/18690#issuecomment-234505083\n\nReading the best practices [recommended by AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/java-sdk/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html), we should use `DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain` instead of providing the detail of the chain ourselves.\n\nFor now, we read credentials (if not provided in `elasticsearch.yml`) using:\n\n``` java\ncredentials = new AWSCredentialsProviderChain(\n   new SystemPropertiesCredentialsProvider(),\n   new EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider(),\n   new InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider()\n);\n```\n\nWhich means that we read from:\n- Environment Variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (RECOMMENDED since they are recognized by all the AWS SDKs and CLI except for .NET), or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` (only recognized by Java SDK)\n- Java System Properties - `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`\n- Instance profile credentials delivered through the Amazon EC2 metadata service\n\nUsing instead:\n\n``` java\ncredentials = new DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain();\n```\n\nWill give us two new more methods out of the box:\n\n> - Credential profiles file at the default location (`~/.aws/credentials`) shared by all AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI\n> - Credentials delivered through the Amazon EC2 container service if `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` environment variable is set and security manager has permission to access the variable\n\nCherry on the cake: as soon as AWS SDK will propose a new implementation, we will benefit from it without any modification (just updating the SDK).\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
