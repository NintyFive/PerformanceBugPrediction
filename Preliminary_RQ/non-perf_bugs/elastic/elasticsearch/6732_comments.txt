I'd like to make an argument for this being a more severe issue than meets the eye.\n\nIn my experience, if you add a _corrupt_ setting to an index -- e.g., an `analyzer` which references a `char_filter` that doesn't exist, perhaps because you spelled it wrong -- then you've put that index into a corrupt state and ElasticSearch won't allocate the shards when you try to re-open that index.\n\nNot being able to modify the setting means that you need to reindex everything with brand new settings in order to recover your index. If you happen to run into this issue when targeting `_all` indexes, things get a lot worse.\n\n_A temporary workaround, specifically in the case of analyzers: if you switch the `type` from `custom` to `standard` then ElasticSearch seems to ignore all of its settings, and thus your spelling mistake looses its ability to corrupt the index, but there's still a hacky, pointless analyzer in your settings._\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/55166534","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6732#issuecomment-55166534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6732","id":55166534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTY2NTM0","user":{"login":"robusto","id":1924707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjQ3MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1924707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robusto","html_url":"https://github.com/robusto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robusto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robusto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robusto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robusto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robusto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robusto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robusto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robusto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robusto/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-10T19:07:32Z","updated_at":"2014-09-10T19:07:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@georgi0u Thanks for that workaround.
