It would populate that new field with the highest estimate it had ever made of how much memory it would need to do the next analysis step, _even if as a result of making that estimate it decided not to do that analysis step_ and instead put the job into the `hard_limit` state.\r\n\r\n@edsavage at some point (it's not mega urgent) please could you do a more in depth assessment of how we could feed back this extra statistic from the `autodetect` process into the `model_size_stats`?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
