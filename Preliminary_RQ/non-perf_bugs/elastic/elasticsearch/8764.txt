Note that orientation is with respect to the map/coordinate system - left = cw, right = ccw  \n\nThe following provides an example where the order parameter specifies explicit dateline crossing and will result in https://gist.github.com/nknize/d122b243dc63dcba8474.  Using 'left' will result in https://gist.github.com/anonymous/82b50b74a7b6d170bfc6    Note that in the following example all holes will be converted to clockwise (left) order for OGC compliance (see #8762).  \n\n``` java\n\"geometry\": {\n        \"type\": \"Polygon\",\n        \"orientation\": \"right\"\n        \"coordinates\": [\n          [ [178, 42], [178, 39], [-178, 39], [-178, 42], [178, 42] ]\n      }\n```\n\nAbsent this parameter functionality will work as described (and implemented) in #8762\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
