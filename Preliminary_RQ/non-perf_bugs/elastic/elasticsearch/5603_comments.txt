I'm assuming that, in the meantime, you've figured out how to handle this (ie the results are returned in the same order as the queries).  Given that nobody else has shown interest in this particular issue, I think this extra functionality is not that useful, and I'm going to close the ticket.  If you still feel strongly about this, reopen and we can discuss further.\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
