working with histogram aggregation but there is something strange with keys.\nFor instance (cf : http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html):\n\nIf I use this request :\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"aggs\" : {\n        \"prices\" : {\n            \"histogram\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"price\",\n                \"interval\" : 50\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI obtain something like this :\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"aggregations\": {\n        \"prices\" : {\n            \"buckets\": [\n                {\n                    \"key_as_string\" : \"0\",\n                    \"key\": 0,\n                    \"doc_count\": 2\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key_as_string\" : \"50\",\n                    \"key\": 50,\n                    \"doc_count\": 4\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key_as_string\" : \"150\",\n                    \"key\": 150,\n                    \"doc_count\": 3\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nInstead of :\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"aggregations\": {\n        \"prices\" : {\n            \"buckets\": [\n                {\n                    \"key\": 0,\n                    \"doc_count\": 2\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\": 50,\n                    \"doc_count\": 4\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\": 150,\n                    \"doc_count\": 3\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou could say, it's not important but it generates json ~1/3 bigger...\nIs there a mean to disable this ???\n\nMoreover, in Elasticsearch Java API, it could be fine to have a method to request the response as a hash instead keyed by the buckets keys (cf :http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html#_response_format)\n\nThanks!!!\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
