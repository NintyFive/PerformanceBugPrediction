The next is written in the latest documentation : \n\nExpired documents will be automatically deleted regularly. You can dynamically set the indices.ttl.interval to fit your needs. The default value is 60s . \nThe deletion orders are processed by bulk. You can set indices.ttl.bulk_size to fit your needs. The default value is 10000.  \n\n---\n\nKnowing this, we modified the indices.ttl.interval to 30s and indices.ttl.bulk_size to 3. After, we sent some  (2000) logs into our index with _ttl : 1m . \nAfter a while, we noticed that more logs have been deleted as expected. So all logs were deleted within 30s after one minute elapsed but there only 3 logs should have been deleted.\nIs this normal ? We thought that only 3 logs will be deleted. How is the deletion of logs implemented on the elasticsearch ? Could you give me more information on the deletion of logs ?\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
