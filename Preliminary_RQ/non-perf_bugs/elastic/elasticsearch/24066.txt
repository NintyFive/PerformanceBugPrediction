I created the snapshot repo and was able to take snapshots of individual small indices. When I try to take the snapshot on the entire indices set, the snapshot process gets stuck on a couple of shards in a particular index. I had to stop the Elastic Search servers and restart them to clear the stuck snapshot. \r\nAfter restarting, when I tried taking the snapshot, it again got stuck in the same shards. It has been stuck for past 15 hours.\r\n\r\nPlease see below to see the stuck shards '3' & '4'\r\n\r\n \"2\": {\r\n                     \"stage\": \"DONE\",\r\n                     \"stats\": {\r\n                        \"number_of_files\": 207,\r\n                        \"processed_files\": 207,\r\n                        \"total_size_in_bytes\": 50471623283,\r\n                        \"processed_size_in_bytes\": 50471623283,\r\n                        \"start_time_in_millis\": 1491948418067,\r\n                        \"time_in_millis\": 2135013\r\n                     }\r\n                  },\r\n                  \"3\": {\r\n                     \"stage\": \"STARTED\",\r\n                     \"stats\": {\r\n                        \"number_of_files\": 204,\r\n                        \"processed_files\": 190,\r\n                        \"total_size_in_bytes\": 43726103499,\r\n                        \"processed_size_in_bytes\": 32915497923,\r\n                        \"start_time_in_millis\": 1491948498451,\r\n                        \"time_in_millis\": 0\r\n                     },\r\n                     \"node\": \"ohMx7BUXRfyym0YaTlpreQ\"\r\n                  },\r\n                  \"4\": {\r\n                     \"stage\": \"STARTED\",\r\n                     \"stats\": {\r\n                        \"number_of_files\": 211,\r\n                        \"processed_files\": 187,\r\n                        \"total_size_in_bytes\": 51847398788,\r\n                        \"processed_size_in_bytes\": 40983724276,\r\n                        \"start_time_in_millis\": 1491948421440,\r\n                        \"time_in_millis\": 0\r\n                     },\r\n                     \"node\": \"inro3uspRw68FigfTxxu3Q\"\r\n\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the feature**:\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"abeyad","id":1631297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzEyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1631297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad","html_url":"https://github.com/abeyad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abeyad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
