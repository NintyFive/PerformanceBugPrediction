The actual command in the documentation looks like this:\n\n```\n./bin/elasticsearch -Djava.io.tmpdir=/path/to/temp/dir\n```\n\nSince the `-D` option isn't available, the output when running the command is:\n\n```\nelasticsearch@host:/elasticsearch$ ./bin/elasticsearch -Djava.io.tmpdir=/path/to/temp/dir\nstarts elasticsearch\n\nOption                Description                                              \n------                -----------                                              \n-E <KeyValuePair>     Configure a setting                                      \n-V, --version         Prints elasticsearch version information and exits       \n-d, --daemonize       Starts Elasticsearch in the background                   \n-h, --help            show help                                                \n-p, --pidfile <Path>  Creates a pid file in the specified path on start        \n-q, --quiet           Turns off standard ouput/error streams logging in console\n-s, --silent          show minimal output                                      \n-v, --verbose         show verbose output                                      \nERROR: D is not a recognized option\n```\n\nUpdating the docs to no longer advise on using the `-D` option when starting elasticsearch would in my opinion solve this problem. Other ways of specifying Java options are mentioned in the documentation.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Start elasticsearch with the command `elasticsearch -Djava.io.tmpdir=/path/to/temp/dir`\n2. Elasticsearch responds with an error message regarding the `-D` option\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
