But the documents that go to the shards without replicas allocated (there is no quorum) just have to wait for the general timeout to expire which makes it hard on the client side to manage the indexing process.\n\nSetting `timeout=1ms` on the indexing request will potentially interfere with a normal, slower indexing process and could timeout sooner for nothing.\n","closed_by":{"login":"astefan","id":893749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/893749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan","html_url":"https://github.com/astefan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
