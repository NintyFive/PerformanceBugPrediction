It stop responding to Kibana.  When I tried curl localhost:9200/_nodes/_local on node, it just hangs.   Eventually (30+ minutes, I went to get coffee, do something else), I control-c it :-}.\n\nI posted part of the logs above (those are the common errors I was seeing).  I'd have to scrub it before putting entire log in public.\n\nAll API calls were failing, e.g. they all timed out or hang....   I ended up having to bounce tribe node each time, and it would be (maybe) useable for a bit before getting into a bad state again due to downstream cluster mis-behaving/sad.\n\nThese problems are due to one or more clusters.   No specific ones, although some clusters tend to \"experience\" more issues than others.   Due to internal policy, I do not have administrative control over all clusters.   But I do own the tribe nodes and am responsible for aggregating data from all clusters.\n\nSo I am caught between a rock and a very hard place.   I need tribe nodes to be highly resistant to misbehaving downstream clusters/nodes.   If a downstream clusters/nodes have issues, tribe should be able to skip/drop from list and check back later to see if that particular cluster or node has recovered.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/99696826","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9865#issuecomment-99696826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9865","id":99696826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5Njk2ODI2","user":{"login":"pickypg","id":1501235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1501235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg","html_url":"https://github.com/pickypg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-07T03:13:48Z","updated_at":"2015-05-07T03:13:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Well, in that case, let's figure out how to get us those logs.
