I would consider this a bug in Painless because this error message is probably the *worst* one I've seen so far, and the error should never get as far compilation in this case.  I'll need to investigate further, but as a guess this happens because ```it``` is of the def type, and we assume any type can be assigned to a def when a void actually cannot be under any circumstance.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/347692938","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27210#issuecomment-347692938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27210","id":347692938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzY5MjkzOA==","user":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-28T22:59:03Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T22:59:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is fixed and backported all the way back to 5.6.5.
