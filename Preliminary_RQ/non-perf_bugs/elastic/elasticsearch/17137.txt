If I use dynamic template to create index, the index name will be exactly same as the one I used to write data. Therefore, I have to use index name to write data other than an alias. It's conflict with official recommendation and i can't perform a reindex if need.\nThis problem will be solved if there exists an api like:\n-PUT /_template/example\n{\n    \"template\": \"test-*-write\",\n    \"template_pattern\": \"{index}-write\"\n    \"order\": 1,\n    \"aliases\": {\n      \"{index}-write\": {},\n      \"{index}-read\"; {},\n    }\n}\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
