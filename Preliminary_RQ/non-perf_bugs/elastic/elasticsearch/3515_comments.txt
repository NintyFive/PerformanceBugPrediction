This is a very rare race-condition that happens during node startup. There is a small chance that the clusterstate is still `empty` and that can cause this problem. I will fix that by asking the discovery service or cluster service for the local node instead of going through the cluster state which will be initialized correctly.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
