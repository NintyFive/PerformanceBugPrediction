Sorry about that. it looks like `inFilter` and was just an alias for `termsFilters` and `inQuery` was just an alias for `termsQuery`. So in 2.0 there is just `termsQuery` and you should just use it if you want that \"in any of these terms\" behavior.\n\nI'm going to close this because this bug report should be enough of a trail for people to follow to successfully migrate.

If you want AND then I think the normal way to get that now is with a `bool` query with many `term` queries in the `must` clause.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that the optimizations that the `terms` query does for OR aren't all that useful if you don't have a fair number of terms. So if you have less than 16 terms it is rewritten internally into a `bool` query with many `term` queries in the `should` clause.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
