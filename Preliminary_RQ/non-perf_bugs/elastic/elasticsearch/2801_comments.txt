challenge here is that the required logic for the search is that if the \"missing\" part of the \"OR\" filter is satisfied then the normal \"geo_distance\" filter parsing logic should ignore any of the usual (and sensible) error reporting it has around requiring valid field names.\n\nThere are possibly 2 fixes we could make to ES to make this work:\n\n1) Add an \"ignore_missing\" property to the geo_distance filter in which case it will not complain noisily about the absent field and match nothing\n2) Introduce e a generic wrapper filter e.g. an extension to the \"exists\" filter which only attempts to parse a nested \"filter\" clause if the required field name exists on the index.\n\nWhat we can't do is make the geo_distance filter parser know about the sibling \"missing\" clause in this example as this violates our design principle of composable, extensible filters not needing to have intimate knowledge about the implementations of parents/children/siblings etc in the query tree\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/52204073","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2801#issuecomment-52204073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2801","id":52204073,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjA0MDcz","user":{"login":"owainb","id":8225554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8225554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/owainb","html_url":"https://github.com/owainb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owainb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owainb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owainb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owainb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owainb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owainb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owainb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owainb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owainb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-14T16:06:44Z","updated_at":"2014-08-14T16:06:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm
