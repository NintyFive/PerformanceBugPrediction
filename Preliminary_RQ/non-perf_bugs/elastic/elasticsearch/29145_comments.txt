provides a [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) for asking general questions and instead prefers to use GitHub only for verified bug reports and feature requests. If you post there, someone will try to help you. I should remark though, you should provide a full reproduction for this, something that another member of the community can run on their machine that reproduces the issue exactly. You have not done that here (you haven't told us what Docker image you're using, how you're customizing that image, etc., and you haven't told us what command you're running to start the container; these are table stakes for an effective bug report in terms of being able to get you meaningful help quickly). Maybe in the course of writing up the reproduction, you will find where you have entered `fals` instead of `false`.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
