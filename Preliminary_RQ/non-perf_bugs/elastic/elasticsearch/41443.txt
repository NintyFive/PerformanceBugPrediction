However, the RestClient is not an interface.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to make RestClient an interface to support use cases where people provide their own implementation. Something like this would be enough:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRestClient {\r\n    public Response performRequest(Request request) throws IOException;\r\n    public void performRequestAsync(Request request, ResponseListener responseListener);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhat do you think ?\r\nIf you guys are ok with this, let me know, I can provide a pull request\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSt√©phane\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hub-cap","id":613352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzM1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/613352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap","html_url":"https://github.com/hub-cap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hub-cap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
