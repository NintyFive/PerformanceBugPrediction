Sorry for this!\r\n\r\nHowever in this particular case, you could potentially just reduce the logging for the `org.elasticsearch.monitor.fs` to `INFO` level and you would be good to go as the above message is on `DEBUG` level.\r\n\r\nI will close this issue and would like to ask you to open a new topic in the [Elasticsearch discussion forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) for further topics.
