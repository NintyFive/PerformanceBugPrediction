the new vector field (#33022), there is concern that users are going to be confused with `dense_vector`/`sparse_vector` on the one hand and `feature_vector` on the other hand, which share similar names even though they have nothing in common.\r\n\r\nIn the search meeting, we discussed renaming `feature_vector` to `feature_map` instead, which still nicely conveys the information that this is a multivalued version of the `feature` field but without introducing confusion with the `dense_vector` and `sparse_vector` fields.\r\n\r\nWe agreed to create an issue with the `discuss` label to get this idea validated by a wider audience in Fixit Thursday/Friday.\r\n\r\nNone of these fields are released yet so there is no concern around backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
