Original issue content below._\r\n\r\nSupport MFA (Multifactor Authentication) using the RequestedAuthnContext attribute on the SP side (Kibana). This is for Shibboleth, which we are using for federated IdM in the Omnisoc initiative (LINK REDACTED). The federation is InCommon, a higher ed federation.\r\n\r\nI have used Shibboleth on the SP side in ES 6.1 to do MFA, but it's really just an overlay on ES. There's shibd running, which is the SP, and I can add RequestedAuthnContext there within /etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml as authnContextClassRef=\"LINK REDACTED\" in the <SSO ...> entity.\r\nShould be able to do something similar in the ES SAML implementation.\r\n\r\nI do have SAML working in a dev ELK with ES 6.2.2.","closed_by":{"login":"jkakavas","id":10281256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgxMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10281256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas","html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
