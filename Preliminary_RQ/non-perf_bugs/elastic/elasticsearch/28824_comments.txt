Can you give more detail on how to make this happen, ideally so we can run the instructions on a clean installation?\r\n\r\nHowever I note that the actual and desired time are 26 hours apart, which could be explained by confusing UTC+13 and UTC-13, or by confusing local time with UTC somewhere. The time stamps in the OP do not all have timezones attached. Note that IANA timezone `Etc/GMT-13` coincides with New Zealand's time zone at the moment, not `Etc/GMT+13`, although if that's the problem then I recommend using `Pacific/Auckland` instead to correctly handle DST.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/368433021","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28824#issuecomment-368433021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28824","id":368433021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODQzMzAyMQ==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-26T09:04:04Z","updated_at":"2018-02-26T09:04:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/cc @elastic/es-core-infra","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/368598510","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28824#issuecomment-368598510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28824","id":368598510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODU5ODUxMA==","user":{"login":"cj-nza","id":36836140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODM2MTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/36836140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-nza","html_url":"https://github.com/cj-nza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-nza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-nza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-nza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-nza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-nza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-nza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-nza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-nza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-nza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-26T18:22:57Z","updated_at":"2018-02-26T18:22:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks -

I'm going to close this issue, but if the investigation with Filebeat results in a reproduction that involves just Elasticsearch and not Filebeat then please re-open this. Please link to this issue from the issue in the Beats repository so it's easier to follow the thread.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
