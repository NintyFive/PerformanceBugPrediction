Execution is different, since gradle uses exceptions to signal build failure, but does not distinguish unknown exceptions from a normal build failure. If there was a way to default both stacktrace and debug, it would be extremely noisy, so from that alone I dont think we would want this, but there is also the fact there is simply no way to enable these by default. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
