But same behavior on producution system. \r\n**Plugins installed**: []\r\n\r\n**JVM version** : 1.8.0_112\r\n\r\n**OS version**  : OSx, Linux \r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\nWhen Im trying to aggregate 7d buckets with summing - first bucket take wrong date (closes thursday as I suppose).  \r\nExample. For dates  \"2017-12-01\" -  \"2017-12-07\" in filter and extended_bounds expected first bucket is 2017-12-01. But actual is 2017-11-30 (thursday again).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\nMy query is \r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"size\": 0,\r\n      \"query\": {\r\n        \"bool\": {\r\n          \"must\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"range\": {\r\n                \"doc.dateExecute\": {\r\n                  \"from\": \"2017-12-01\",\r\n                  \"to\": \"2017-12-07\",\r\n                  \"include_lower\": true,\r\n                  \"include_upper\": true,\r\n                  \"boost\": 1.0\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          ],\r\n          \"disable_coord\": false,\r\n          \"adjust_pure_negative\": true,\r\n          \"boost\": 1.0,\r\n          \"_name\": \"onDates\"\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"aggregations\": {\r\n        \"time\": {\r\n          \"date_histogram\": {\r\n            \"field\": \"doc.dateExecute\",\r\n\r\n            \"interval\": \"7d\",\r\n            \"offset\": 0,\r\n            \"order\": {\r\n              \"_key\": \"asc\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"keyed\": false,\r\n            \"min_doc_count\": 0,\r\n            \"extended_bounds\": {\r\n              \"min\": \"2017-12-01\",\r\n              \"max\": \"2017-12-07\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n And the response is \r\n \r\n    {\r\n      \"took\": 10,\r\n      \"timed_out\": false,\r\n      \"_shards\": {\r\n        \"total\": 230,\r\n        \"successful\": 230,\r\n        \"failed\": 0\r\n      },\r\n      \"hits\": {\r\n        \"total\": 0,\r\n        \"max_score\": 0,\r\n        \"hits\": []\r\n      },\r\n      \"aggregations\": {\r\n        \"time\": {\r\n          \"buckets\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"key_as_string\": \"2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n              \"key\": 1512000000000,\r\n              \"doc_count\": 0\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              \"key_as_string\": \"2017-12-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\r\n              \"key\": 1512604800000,\r\n              \"doc_count\": 0\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\nJust to be clear: other date periods works as expected. 1day, YEAR, Month, week, etc. But with n-days I have that behavior.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
