Especially for the `/_search` endpoint, it would be very useful to have a JSON spec for things like `query` and `aggregations`, with all the different aggregations and their parameter types.  This would allow for generating type-safe API clients in other languages.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I have a toy project [`elastic-ts`](https://github.com/jacobwgillespie/elastic-ts) that was created by reading the HTML documentation online and porting that by hand to TypeScript types, for instance:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jacobwgillespie/elastic-ts/blob/master/src/types/aggregations.ts\r\n\r\nObviously this is not a sustainable way to maintain such a library, so it would cool if there was a programatic way to read things like the aggregations and query schemas.  As far as I can tell, there's no way to do this today short from reading the Java source and looking for instances of `ObjectParser`.","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
