Out of interest, why don't you use the official JS client for Elasticsearch? http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html\n\nEither way, this is something you should be asking in a user forum (either elasticsearch or node) rather than on this github issues list, which is for bug reports and feature requests.\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/71830829","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9456#issuecomment-71830829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9456","id":71830829,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODMwODI5","user":{"login":"ben-walters","id":2077780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzc3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2077780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-walters","html_url":"https://github.com/ben-walters","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-walters/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-walters/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-walters/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-walters/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-walters/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-walters/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-walters/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-walters/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-walters/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-28T12:58:33Z","updated_at":"2015-01-28T12:58:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for that.
