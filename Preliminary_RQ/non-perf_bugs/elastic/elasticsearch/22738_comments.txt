That is emphatically not going to work, the plugin API between 2.x and 5.x is different, classes that existed in 2.x are not necessarily still going to be present in 5.x (and this class is indeed not). You will need to modify the source code to compile with 5.x, and then assemble an entirely new JAR.\r\n\r\nIf you have additional questions, please open a topic on the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co); Elastic reserves GitHub for verified bug reports and feature requests.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
