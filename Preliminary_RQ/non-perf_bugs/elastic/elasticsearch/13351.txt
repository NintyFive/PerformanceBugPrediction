We cannot do this currently for a [lon,lat] to the surface of a geo_shape object (distance \"N\").  There's a bit of a workaround for the geo_distance filter: you can create a circle of a specified radius M and check for an \"intersects\" relation.  However, there are some cases where this does not work (e.g. if M > (N + [span of geo_shape]) it's now \"within\").  \n\nA few examples:\n- A vehicle is supposed to follow an indexed LineString / MultiLineString path and we want to find when it has deviated from the path by more than 100 meters [filter]\n- Find the nearest landmark (geo-shape) to my present location [sort] \n","closed_by":{"login":"iverase","id":29038686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDM4Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/29038686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase","html_url":"https://github.com/iverase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
