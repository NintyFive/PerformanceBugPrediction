As @softwaredoug already said, this is probably cause by the way you have set up tokanization or your analysis chain. In general, your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co.  We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature  requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug  report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this  question in the forum instead. Many thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
