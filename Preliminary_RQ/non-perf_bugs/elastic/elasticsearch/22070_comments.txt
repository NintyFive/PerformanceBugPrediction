Also, the mechanism for storing templates has changed in 5.0 - they're now stored in the cluster state instead of in the .scripts index.  If the author of the plugin (or you) can identify that the issue is on our side, and can point to the issue in the master branch, then we'll be happy to take a look at it.\r\n\r\nthanks","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/266387003","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22070#issuecomment-266387003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22070","id":266387003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjM4NzAwMw==","user":{"login":"DrunkenInfant","id":1150225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTAyMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1150225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrunkenInfant","html_url":"https://github.com/DrunkenInfant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrunkenInfant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrunkenInfant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrunkenInfant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrunkenInfant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrunkenInfant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrunkenInfant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrunkenInfant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrunkenInfant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DrunkenInfant/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-12T09:57:59Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T09:57:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for a quick reply @clintongormley !\r\n\r\nFor now I've found a workaround using https://github.com/codelibs/elasticsearch-sstmpl and storing the template using the `/_scripts/handlebars` endpoint.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would still like to know why the `/my_index/my_type/_search/template` is different to the `/_search/template/my_template_id` with regards to plugins and languages.
