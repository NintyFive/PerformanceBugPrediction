We should have levers to control how much memory is allocated to this cache. This could be a percentage based on a configured total memory and explicit control only for this cache should be provided for clients who use nested documents a lot.\r\n\r\nThe following shows a dump of memory from a node which has this filter cache.\r\n![bitsetfiltercache](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15054021/36822701-fa8a939a-1cbe-11e8-9df2-5a812e754eb5.png)\r\n\r\nA related issue is filed in the forum but no feature action has been taken on the same.
