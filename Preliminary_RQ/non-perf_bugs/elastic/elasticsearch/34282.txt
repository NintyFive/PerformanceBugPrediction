But it looks to me like the failure is caused by this series of events:\r\n1. `DirectCandidateGenerator#thresholdFrequency` spits out a frequency that is bigger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This looks to be possible using the default configuration for common words like \"the\" when the corpus is a couple of million documents and each document is large, like, say, as big as a wikipedia page.\r\n2. We call `DirectSpellChecker#setThresholdFrequency` with that number. The JVM helpfully casts the `long` returned by step 1 into a `float`, losing precision but keeping the magnitude of the number largely intact.\r\n3. Lucene attempts to validate that the `float` is either less than 0 or a whole number. The \"is it a whole number\" check looks like `thresholdFrequency != (int) thresholdFrequency`. That will consider floats that don't fit into `int`s as not whole numbers. Most of the time, anyway.\r\n\r\nThere is a work around: set `\"suggest_mode\": \"always\"`. We'll skip the math and just pick 0 for the frequency. Which is both less than one and whole number so Lucene is quite happy with it.\r\n\r\nIt looks like we should either clamp the value to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` in Elasticsearch or Lucene should use something else to check for fractional numbers.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
