Debugging shows that weights appear to be dropped when [query rescore builder is rewritten](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/rescore/QueryRescorerBuilder.java#L244). \r\n\r\nYou can see in the code: \r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public QueryRescorerBuilder rewrite(QueryRewriteContext ctx) throws IOException {\r\n        QueryBuilder rewrite = queryBuilder.rewrite(ctx);\r\n        if (rewrite == queryBuilder) {\r\n            return this;\r\n        }\r\n        return new QueryRescorerBuilder(rewrite);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat various rescore settings are not carried through to the rewritten QueryRescoreBuilder. Only the rewritten query builder is carried through, not the weights that are also part of this. IE I would expect something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public QueryRescorerBuilder rewrite(QueryRewriteContext ctx) throws IOException {\r\n        QueryBuilder rewrite = queryBuilder.rewrite(ctx);\r\n        if (rewrite == queryBuilder) {\r\n            return this;\r\n        }\r\n        return new QueryRescorerBuilder(rewrite)\r\n                           .setRescoreQueryWeight(rescoreQueryWeight) \r\n                           . (additional settings carried through )\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nSee this [integration test](https://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank/blob/es6_1/src/test/java/com/o19s/es/ltr/query/StoredLtrQueryIT.java#L58)\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
