As the list of watches grows it would be nice to have a way to organize the watches so that they're easier to find.  \r\n\r\nWe currently use watches to alert on events from the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n- Using metricbeat for monitoring our servers, processes, and Windows services\r\n\r\n- Using heartbeat for monitoring server / service / URL up time\r\n\r\n- Using filebeat to gather logs and alert on the absence of the logs altogether as well as error level events and keyword events\r\n\r\n- Using winlogbeat to gather security and application logs and alert on server / database login events and other application error events\r\n\r\nFor our team this would allow us to break out the watches into a structure like the following:\r\n\r\n- Server Health\r\n\r\n- Application Health\r\n\r\n- Elasticsearch Cluster Health\r\n\r\n- User Specific watches","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
