To work around this we have to sign the rpm after the fact with some cryptic rpm command where I feel not happy with since it modifies the actual already build package that comes out of our mvn build. This means all the `.asc .md5 .sha1`we produce in the build are useless and broken. \nWe don't have tests for this package that run on a regular basis neither do we tests it on release.  This should either be fully tested like our tar and gz file and the signing must work out of the box or this format must go away. I don't care how many people would like to have it or not, it's untested and I rather ship nothing than an untested package.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
