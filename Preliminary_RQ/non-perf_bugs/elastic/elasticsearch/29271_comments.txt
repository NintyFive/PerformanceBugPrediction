This is handy for time based data, roll over APIs, versioned indices etc. The filters in the aliases are meant as a convenience (instead of adding them to each search) mostly for a multi-tenancy scenario where the data from multiple users is put into one index and come really handy together with a routing value. Alias are not meant as a full security feature (the security use cases are way more complicated). \r\n\r\nI'm going to close this as won't fix. I suggest you implement this on the client side.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
