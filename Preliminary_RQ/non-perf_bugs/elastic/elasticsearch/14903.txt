However, the problem is that it can cause it to use too much heap for it is loaded for all nested fields (regardless of whether these fields are being used). To prevent this from happening, a common configuration workaround is to set `index.load_fixed_bitset_filters_eagerly: false` in the yml of the nodes and restart them to prevent the nodes from running OOM when attempting to eagerly load the fixedbitsets. \n\nAt this point, I have seen enough occurrences of this in the field which necessitates the setting of `index.load_fixed_bitset_filters_eagerly: false` to prevent the nodes from running out of memory.  It may make sense to start documenting this setting unless there is a better solution we are already planning :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
