It returns documents that match the suggestion query. In your example the document matches both `Cloud Computing` and `Cloud Services` but it is returned only once. As such, results of the suggester are hits that respect the options set in the query. In your example you disabled `_source` so the suggester hits are returned with an empty _source.\r\n\r\nI hope you don't mind if I close this issue, we reserve github for verified bugs and feature request.\r\nI or someone else from the community will be happy to help you configure your suggest field in the forum: https://discuss.elastic.co/t","performed_via_github_app":null}]
