There's no real benefit in having this as there's no speedup due to very high bandwidth.  Additionally, it doesn't even speed up switch throughput as switches aren't involved.\n\nIt would be ideal to disable compression when talking to the local host and would avoid wasted compression/decompression for next to no benefit.  \n\n```\n        at java.util.zip.Deflater.deflateBytes(Native Method)\n        at java.util.zip.Deflater.deflate(Deflater.java:444)\n        - locked <0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX> (a java.util.zip.ZStreamRef)\n        at java.util.zip.Deflater.deflate(Deflater.java:366)\n        at java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.deflate(DeflaterOutputStream.java:251)\n        at java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.write(DeflaterOutputStream.java:211)\n        at java.io.BufferedOutputStream.flushBuffer(BufferedOutputStream.java:82)\n        at java.io.BufferedOutputStream.write(BufferedOutputStream.java:126)\n        - locked <0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX> (a java.io.BufferedOutputStream)\n        at org.elasticsearch.common.io.stream.OutputStreamStreamOutput.writeBytes(OutputStreamStreamOutput.java:42)\n        at org.elasticsearch.common.io.stream.StreamOutput.write(StreamOutput.java:299)\n        at org.jboss.netty.buffer.HeapChannelBuffer.getBytes(HeapChannelBuffer.java:111)\n        at org.elasticsearch.common.bytes.ChannelBufferBytesReference.writeTo(ChannelBufferBytesReference.java:64)\n        at org.elasticsearch.common.io.stream.StreamOutput.writeBytesReference(StreamOutput.java:127)\n        at org.elasticsearch.action.index.IndexRequest.writeTo(IndexRequest.java:732)\n        at org.elasticsearch.action.bulk.BulkRequest.writeTo(BulkRequest.java:546)\n        at org.elasticsearch.transport.netty.NettyTransport.sendRequest(NettyTransport.java:863)\n        at org.elasticsearch.transport.TransportService.sendRequest(TransportService.java:329)\n        at org.elasticsearch.action.TransportActionNodeProxy.execute(TransportActionNodeProxy.java:51)\n        at org.elasticsearch.client.transport.support.TransportProxyClient$1.doWithNode(TransportProxyClient.java:58)\n        at org.elasticsearch.client.transport.TransportClientNodesService.execute(TransportClientNodesService.java:212)\n        at org.elasticsearch.client.transport.support.TransportProxyClient.execute(TransportProxyClient.java:55)\n        at org.elasticsearch.client.transport.TransportClient.doExecute(TransportClient.java:288)\n        at org.elasticsearch.client.support.AbstractClient.execute(AbstractClient.java:359)\n        at org.elasticsearch.action.ActionRequestBuilder.execute(ActionRequestBuilder.java:86)\n        at org.elasticsearch.action.ActionRequestBuilder.execute(ActionRequestBuilder.java:56)\n\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"burtonator","id":45447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/45447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/burtonator","html_url":"https://github.com/burtonator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burtonator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burtonator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burtonator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burtonator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burtonator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burtonator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burtonator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burtonator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burtonator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
