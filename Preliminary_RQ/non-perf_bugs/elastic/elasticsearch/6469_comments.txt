I assume this one is different due to the asymmetric nature of the network partition. But in essence it is the same as you have two masters in your cluster (correct?).\n\n> The cluster is stuck in this state, even when every node could reach every other node (verified with curl on the es http port and binary port).\n\nOnce a cluster has formed, ES will verify the all the nodes of the cluster are active (via pinging) but it will not consistently look for new nodes. The assumption is that if a new node comes up, it will actively join the cluster. The down side is that if you end up with two stable \"sub\" cluster - they will not discover each other.\n\n> Some of these nodes give an NPE for the _status endpoint:\n> {\"error\":\"NullPointerException[null]\",\"status\":500}\n\nDo you have a stack trace in your ES logs?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/46162727","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6469#issuecomment-46162727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6469","id":46162727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTYyNzI3","user":{"login":"magnhaug","id":477436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzQzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/477436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magnhaug","html_url":"https://github.com/magnhaug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magnhaug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magnhaug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magnhaug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magnhaug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magnhaug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magnhaug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magnhaug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magnhaug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magnhaug/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-16T10:26:34Z","updated_at":"2014-06-16T10:26:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, the issue looks similar to #2488, it might be wise to use this as another test case on the improved_zen branch.\nAs far as I remember, we saw two master nodes in the two different clusters.
