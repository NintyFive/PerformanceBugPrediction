There are lots of times when you want to break the standards and we need to account for that.\r\n2. We have a ton of code that wouldn't comply with the standard and it is difficult with tools like checkstyle don't [support](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/3242) properly ratcheting down failures.
