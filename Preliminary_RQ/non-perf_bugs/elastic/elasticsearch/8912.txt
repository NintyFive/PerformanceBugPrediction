I've honestly never been in a situation where I needed it.  I've always used the strategy from the [old blog post](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/changing-mapping-with-zero-downtime/) about changing mappings with no downtime when I needed to reshard.  This has the advantage of letting me change the mapping and analysis configuration which is much more common for me.\n\nI totally won't be offended if you close this with \"yup, still not something we want to do.\"  I'll just reply with a link here rather than repeating myself the next time someone asks.  Not that it's all _that_ frequent.
