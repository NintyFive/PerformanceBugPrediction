This doesn't necessarily be in the document itself, e.g. a child document would be useful as well. I often use the percolator to categorize incoming data. This data is given by external services and is messy, though fixable by simple \"search and clean\". We use the percolator to register (sometimes user-created) queries that map those entries to our internal values.\n\nCurrently, this works like this:\n- Percolate the document\n- Write the result to the `categories` field\n- Index the document\n\nAllowing this within the percolation step itself would vastly reduce our network overhead in this case and (if bulk percolation happens) also allow us to do bulk actions in one step.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/21241897","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3173#issuecomment-21241897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3173","id":21241897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjQxODk3","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-19T10:12:08Z","updated_at":"2013-07-19T10:12:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So It is like a percolate post write operation?
