I would really wish, that arbitrary chars would still be allowed. My current workaround is to do the hex encoding manually. My aggregation names are computed dynamically and are displayed on the frontend, so avoiding non-alpha-numerics is not an option for me.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/47882813","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5253#issuecomment-47882813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5253","id":47882813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODgyODEz","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-03T09:01:18Z","updated_at":"2014-07-03T09:01:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Opened issue #6702 to address the above comment\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
