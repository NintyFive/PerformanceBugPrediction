However, there are occasions when none of these is available to a user.  For example, when using DC/OS elastic package.  It would be great to be able to set them via the APIs.  Further, to be able to specify all repository settings dynamically would be very desirable as we can bypass a cluster restart for the settings to take effect.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
