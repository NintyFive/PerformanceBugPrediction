I have to achieve bi-directional searching between the document.\n\nFor example, lets consider LinkedIn job relevancy. I want to search for Candidate->Job and Job->Candidate. Both the document set's exists in Elasticsearch i.e, candidate and job.\n\nI want to apply a \"Minimum_should_match\" for skills query.i.e., atleast 2 of the 3 jobs skills should match for a Candidate. I managed to achieve this using \"should\" and \"minimum_should_match\" for Job->Candidate but failed to replicate the same for Candidate->Job.\n\nIs this possible with scripting for minimum_should_match? Didn't find any examples for this.\n\nKindly help..!\n\nNote:- Scoring is not an option. As we already have a separate scoring algo in place.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
