We decided though to move it to the `elasticsearch` repo for a few reasons, if memory serves. First of all we wanted to make sure that the REST spec and tests stayed up-to-date with the actual elasticsearch code and the `elasticsearch` repo felt like a more natural location for it. Also, REST spec and tests evolve in the different `elasticsearch` repo branches, and we found ourselves needing to have exactly the same branches on the separate repo that we had. Last but not least, I think we weren't too happy with git submodules and some of their limitations and things are working better without for us.\n\nI don't think we want to go back at this point, I hope that is not a blocker for you. If you do wish do checkout only that directory out of the elasticsearch repo, there should be a couple of ways to do it with git though.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/84588721","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10201#issuecomment-84588721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10201","id":84588721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NTg4NzIx","user":{"login":"timschlechter","id":2721613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjE2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2721613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timschlechter","html_url":"https://github.com/timschlechter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timschlechter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timschlechter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timschlechter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timschlechter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timschlechter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timschlechter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timschlechter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timschlechter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timschlechter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-22T11:25:42Z","updated_at":"2015-03-22T11:25:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Keeping submodules in sync whith the main repo is indeed a painfull excersize, and one might ask why use submodules when main repo and submodule evolve at the same pace. So I totally understand the choices you made.\n\nIt's not a blocker for me, it just makes it a bit more convinient for other projects which want to use the spec files directly. But as said it's not a blocker for me, and I can't imagin it would be a blocker for anyone.\n\nThanks for the info, I'll close this one.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
