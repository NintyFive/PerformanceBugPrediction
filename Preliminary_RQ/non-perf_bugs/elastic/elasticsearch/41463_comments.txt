I had suspected that might be the case, and I appreciate this is probably stretching the snapshot/restore system a bit beyond its original intent.  I think I can live with snapshot deletion failures for now, though if this fruit ever moves down a few branches, it would definitely be great to have a bit more flexibility.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
