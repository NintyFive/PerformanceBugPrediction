The one you describe is O(n^2) which is fine for small n but not good if the history list gets big. Collecting to a Set would probably be faster then. In any case, we could do the set construction for you if we detect that it'd be more efficient.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/305229584","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24980#issuecomment-305229584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24980","id":305229584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTIyOTU4NA==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T15:46:16Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T15:46:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We should not have set operations on lists, that is trappy.
