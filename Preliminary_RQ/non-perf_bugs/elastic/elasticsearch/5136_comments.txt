Reading the `/etc/init.d/elasticsearch` you can very well just configure your custom JAVA_HOME (that variable is not touched or changed if it already is configured). The following worked for me (just downloaded some arbitrary jdk to test)\n\n```\nexport JAVA_HOME=/tmp/openjdk-1.7.0-u40-unofficial-linux-i586-image/bin/java\n/etc/init.d/elasticsearch start\n# ps auxw | grep elasticsearch\nelasticsearch      25401  4.2 22.5 1230532 114368 ?      Sl   07:50   0:02 /tmp/openjdk-1.7.0-u40-unofficial-linux-i586-image/bin/java .... [and way more here]\n```\n\nCan you give some more information what is not working as expected in your case?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/35247637","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5136#issuecomment-35247637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5136","id":35247637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjQ3NjM3","user":{"login":"kevinstembridge","id":1237181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzcxODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1237181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinstembridge","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinstembridge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinstembridge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinstembridge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinstembridge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinstembridge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinstembridge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinstembridge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinstembridge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinstembridge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinstembridge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-17T11:10:11Z","updated_at":"2014-02-17T11:10:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for checking this out for me.
