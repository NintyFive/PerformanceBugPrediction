If I had to guess its because Elasticsearch is moving files around to balance the cluster. Depending on your version it could be doing some silly things like moving files to a machine that doesn't have enough disk space for them. You can check (cat recovery)[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cat-recovery.html] to see what is moving around right now.\n\n> Why disk usage are different on different nodes ?\n\nElasticsearch balances the total number of shards and doesn't balance the total disk usage across nodes. It uses hard limits on disk usage to push shards off of nodes that go over the limits but that is all it does with shard size.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/336711080","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14891#issuecomment-336711080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14891","id":336711080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjcxMTA4MA==","user":{"login":"gorefbitim","id":12482494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDgyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12482494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorefbitim","html_url":"https://github.com/gorefbitim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorefbitim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorefbitim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorefbitim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorefbitim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorefbitim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorefbitim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorefbitim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorefbitim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorefbitim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-15T13:19:09Z","updated_at":"2017-10-15T13:19:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I know it's a while, but had the same problem - disk space went down with almost no new data.
