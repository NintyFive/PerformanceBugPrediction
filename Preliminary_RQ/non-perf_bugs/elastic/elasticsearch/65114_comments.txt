Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Please provide additional information like what kind of query you are issuing exactly, what the documents look like you are expecting to match and what the actual results look like when opening an issue there. Many Thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
