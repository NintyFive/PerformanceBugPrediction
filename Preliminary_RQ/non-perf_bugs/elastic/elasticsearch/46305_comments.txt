Unfortunately, I don't think that kind of feature is something we can implement in any kind of efficient way. That would require synchronizing the throughput across all the nodes via some mechanism which would require frequent communication between the nodes to give accurate rate limiting since all the nodes would have to constantly acquire permission (and then wait for those permissions) for writing data before doing any writes?\r\n\r\nThis kind of throttling is probably better handled via the shared file system setup instead. I don't see a way for ES to provide it in an efficient manner given that multiple ES nodes write to the shared FS simultaneously but maybe I'm misunderstanding the feature request?\r\n\r\nFor now I'll close here since it seems impossible to address this feature request, but please feel free to reopen if I missed anything.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/527812882","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46305#issuecomment-527812882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46305","id":527812882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzgxMjg4Mg==","user":{"login":"hulkk","id":24830359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODMwMzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/24830359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hulkk","html_url":"https://github.com/hulkk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hulkk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hulkk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hulkk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hulkk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hulkk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hulkk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hulkk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hulkk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hulkk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T09:05:44Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T09:05:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Could this repository setting be improved in a way that it could be updated dynamically?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/527838085","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46305#issuecomment-527838085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46305","id":527838085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzgzODA4NQ==","user":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T10:15:09Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T10:15:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think that's something we could do probably.
