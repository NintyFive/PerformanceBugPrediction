If the service user is different and doesn't have access this might explain why when you run elasticsearch.bat the share is readable.\r\n\r\nYeah, I considered this. Tried all possible ways to by changing the accounts in `Logon` tab. Din't work.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/567564991","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50117#issuecomment-567564991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/50117","id":567564991,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzU2NDk5MQ==","user":{"login":"justviswa","id":52745572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzQ1NTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/52745572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justviswa","html_url":"https://github.com/justviswa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justviswa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justviswa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justviswa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justviswa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justviswa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justviswa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justviswa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justviswa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justviswa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-19T16:36:10Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T16:43:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"**Final Update (and Solution):** Am posting 'why this issue occurred & how I fixed it' here so that it will be helpful for others.\r\n\r\nAs I already said, if we gave a network share (**which requires credentials**, for instance assume cross-domain share) in `path.repo` of elasticsearch.yml, elasticsearch service doesn't start even if we are connected to it using `net use` command. \r\n\r\nThis happened because service runs entirely in a different context i.e., it runs using System account (ntauthority/system) isolated from the currently logged on user (More info [here](https://serverfault.com/questions/177139/windows-service-cant-access-network-share)). \r\n\r\nSo we need to run the `net use` command in the context of service (or system account), so I followed this link [here](https://davidhamann.de/2018/08/17/running-script-as-local-system-windows/) to do this. And finally the elasticsearch service got started. \r\n\r\n@rjernst You mentioned you were not able to reproduce this. Did you try giving a network share which **requires credentials**? And were you running the service using \"Local System Account\" as Logon? If so, this might be the reason. \r\n\r\n**Details Soln:** (Temporary one, searching for better options)\r\n1. Download PSTools\r\n2. Execute `psexec -i -s cmd.exe`\r\n3. Now execute `net use` command in the command prompt opened. Try starting the service, it works.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
