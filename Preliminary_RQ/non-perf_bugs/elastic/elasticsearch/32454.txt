After unpacking the deb and running the pre-install script. It printed the java error to the screen, but `dpkg` is suppressing the output. So, you have to understand debs pretty well to figure it out. \r\n\r\nAnd, I know you did put this in the instructions. And, I can see why you would not give a hard requirement since there are a bunch of different Java's you can install. And, I mostly blame Debian/Ubuntu for not printing the error. But, I think there will be other people that will just fly by the top part of the instructions. Since, it is quite common to have to add repositories I mostly just copy / paste the commands. \r\n\r\nOr add `java -version && ...` on the last part of the command chain and you get a good error. \r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dliappis","id":1754575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTQ1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1754575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis","html_url":"https://github.com/dliappis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
