are working towards using Metricbeat to collect Elasticsearch monitoring information instead of Elasticsearch collecting this internally (as has traditionally been the case).\r\n\r\nOne of the pieces of monitoring information that is collected is a cluster's license. This information is indexed in `type: cluster_stats` documents in `.monitoring-es-*` indices, under the `license` field.\r\n\r\nWhen using internal collection the `ClusterStatsCollector` generates this license field in the monitoring doc by calling `license.toInnerXContent()`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/cd8dd04103ec0bb8fcbbc6e39e9c8a679175b29a/x-pack/plugin/monitoring/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/monitoring/collector/cluster/ClusterStatsMonitoringDoc.java#L143\r\n\r\nThis method adds `expiry_date` and `expiry_date_in_millis` fields:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/cd8dd04103ec0bb8fcbbc6e39e9c8a679175b29a/x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/license/License.java#L404\r\n\r\nAs such, these two fields get indexed under the `license` field in `.monitoring-es-*` docs with `type: cluster_stats`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when using Metricbeat collection, Metricbeat calls the `GET _license` API. This API currently doesn't expose the `expiry_date` and `expiry_date_in_millis` fields. As a result Metricbeat cannot collect these fields and index them into `.monitoring-es-*` documents of `type: cluster_stats`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ycombinator","id":51061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/51061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator","html_url":"https://github.com/ycombinator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
