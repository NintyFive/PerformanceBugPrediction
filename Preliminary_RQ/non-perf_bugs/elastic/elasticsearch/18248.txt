When the user searches, it jumps to the most relevant fragment rather than the first one (like CTRL+F). And there is a sidebar which lists all search results within the document ordered by relevance. When the user clicks a result, the viewer jumps to that fragment.\n##### Problem\n\nSome documents are 100s of pages long therefore a search can return 1000s of results. In order to get all results within a document currently, I can either set `number_of_fragments` to zero or a very large number. The problem with setting to zero is that I lose all scoring information. The problem with setting a very large number is that it is inefficient.\n##### Solution\n\nI think search highlight pagination would solve the problem.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
