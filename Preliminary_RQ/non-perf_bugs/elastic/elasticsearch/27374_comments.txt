Doc values is columnar storage, fetching values of X different fields requires to perform a seek in each column, which is going to be slow. On the other hand, `_source` guarantees at most one disk seek, regardless of the number of fields to fetch.\r\n\r\nI believe you already configured `index.codec: best_compression`?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/390937915","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27374#issuecomment-390937915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27374","id":390937915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDkzNzkxNQ==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-22T10:12:16Z","updated_at":"2018-05-22T10:12:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ping @elastic/es-search-aggs  .

We also want to have consistency in our APIs so adding this feature to the `get` API only would introduce a discrepancy. For these reasons I am going to close this issue, we can revisit in the future if updates are implemented differently. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
