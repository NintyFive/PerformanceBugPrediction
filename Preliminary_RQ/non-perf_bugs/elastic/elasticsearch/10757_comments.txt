The `keyed` parameter is not available in the Java API as it would have no affect. Regardless of whether `keyed` is set to `true` or `false` the same object would be returned and those methods would still be available. The purpose of the `keyed` method is to allow clients which deal directly with the JSON response to specify the structure of the JSON. The Java API does not deal with the JSON response but directly with the response objects created in the aggregation.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/97413273","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10757#issuecomment-97413273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10757","id":97413273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3NDEzMjcz","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-29T12:35:13Z","updated_at":"2015-04-29T12:35:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @colings86 - closing\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
