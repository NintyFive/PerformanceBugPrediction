the Java API, If one sets the content of a search request through `SearchRequestBuilder#setSource` methods and then calls `toString` to see the result, not only the content of the request is not returned as it wasn't set through `sourceBuilder()`,  the content of the request gets also reset due to the `internalBuilder()` call in `toString`.\n\nHere is a small failing test that demontrates it:\n\n```\nSearchRequestBuilder searchRequestBuilder = new SearchRequestBuilder(client()).setSource(\"{\\n\" +\n                \"            \\\"query\\\" : {\\n\" +\n                \"

searchRequestBuilder.request().source().toUtf8();\nsearchRequestBuilder.toString();\nString postToString = searchRequestBuilder.request().source().toUtf8();\nassertThat(preToString,
