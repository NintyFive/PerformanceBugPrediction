The MLT query is designed to be efficient when a few ids are passed, it would be the same with a query. If the query matches a lot of documents, we'd need to extract the term vectors for each document and merge them into the global statistics for the query. \r\nAccessing the term vectors of a few documents is acceptable but this doesn't scale if we apply the logic to a live query.
