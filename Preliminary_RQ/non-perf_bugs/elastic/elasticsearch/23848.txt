packaging tries to provide a way for users to customize the user/group for Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nIt works okay for Sys V init (although installation does spew some errors that it turns out can be ignored).\r\n\r\nIt does not work at all for systemd, it requires some customization after installation.\r\n\r\nWe do not test either configuration.\r\n\r\nI think permitting custom user/groups here is unnecessary complexity to our packaging, and we should remove this.\r\n\r\nI think that for users that want custom user/groups, they should use an archive distribution, or use a configuration management solution like Ansible/Chef (e.g., our Ansible role permits customizing the user/group for both [Sys V init](https://github.com/elastic/ansible-elasticsearch/blob/771dac0829381033c7faaf4bf149c5bc1bc19891/templates/init/debian/elasticsearch.j2#L37-L39) and

ability to customize the user/group through the packaging.\r\n\r\nRelates #21231, relates
