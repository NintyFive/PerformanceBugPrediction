was recently working through the Enrich documentation to share an explanation of how things work, and found that there was no singular page that explained the flow at a high level.\r\n\r\nIssues I felt:\r\n\r\n- [enriching data](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ingest-enriching-data.html) jumps straight into a list of steps of API calls\r\n- an explanation of the structure of an enrich policy is mainly located within the [put-enrich-policy-api](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/put-enrich-policy-api.html) docs, which is not the most friendly place to be introduced to new terminology and ideas.\r\n\r\nExpected structure from my point of view:\r\n\r\n- the Enriching Data documentation should link to or contain a high-level description of how policies and processors/pipelines interact without getting lost in API call details\r\n- May be useful to think of SEO when choosing wording and titles for the enrich documentation since I find it very difficult to find. The enrich REST APIs seem to be the easiest thing to stumble upon, so maybe a quick win would be a link back to the Enriching Data docs for more context.\r\n- Have match and geo-match examples be treated similarly. Right now it seems the match policy example is being used in the initial flow docs, while the geo-match is hidden within the put-policy-api. Having the example within the put-enrich-policy-API be brought up a level and have dedicated page ([geo-match example](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/put-enrich-policy-api.html#put-enrich-policy-api-example)) might help with browsing for info.\r\n\r\nThese are just some thoughts I had that would make the docs feel easier to browse for me, feel free to disagree!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
