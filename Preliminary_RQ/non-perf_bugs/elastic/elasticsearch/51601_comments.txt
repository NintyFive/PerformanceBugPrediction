Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/580170238","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51601#issuecomment-580170238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/51601","id":580170238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDE3MDIzOA==","user":{"login":"ashwani2797","id":20392218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzkyMjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20392218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwani2797","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwani2797","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwani2797/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwani2797/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwani2797/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwani2797/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwani2797/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwani2797/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwani2797/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwani2797/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwani2797/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-30T09:44:03Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T09:44:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"sure.
