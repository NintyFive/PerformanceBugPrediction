The reason seems to lie in default Kibana and search routing config.\r\n\r\n* Kibana looks to use a preference key for routing searches based on a session ID. It also uses _msearch for dashboards to bulk up requests.\r\n* All primaries were on one data node and the replicas on the other (not uncommon after a restart)\r\n\r\nWhen elasticsearch gets a request to route on a `preference` setting that is a session ID it looks to select a choice of primary vs replica by [hashing the preference string only](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/routing/OperationRouting.java#L181). If each shard of an index presents their list of primaries and replicas in the same order (and I haven't confirmed this is the case!) then this routing algo will pick the same node for all searches given the same session key which is what the user was seeing.\r\n\r\nIf we hashed the preference key AND the shard number we would randomize the choice of primary vs replica and hence node choice for each shard. This would spread load more evenly.","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
