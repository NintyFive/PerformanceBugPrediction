I personally feel we're starting to have a bit of a proliferation of processors with semi-overlapping goals. I'd much rather have a single processor that handles setting values. Now we have 2:\n- one is to set single values on scalar **and** array fields, but if they don't exist it actually adds the value\n- another one to add values to existing scalars and turn them into arrays, or add values to existing arrays, but if the field doesn't exist it adds the values into a single value array.\n\nthat ^ I find a bit messy and confusing.
