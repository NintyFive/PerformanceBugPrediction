Throughout the code, requests to the config index have their refresh policy set to `IMMEDIATE`. This is problematic. When an action is performed that causes multiple refreshes to the index (e.g. deleting mutliple jobs/datafeeds), the refreshes are throttled and long delays (~10s) have been observed.\r\n\r\nThis is also probably the reason behind #30300.\r\n\r\nFuthermore, requests that are not a result of a user action need not have a refresh. For example, when the established model memory is updated during runtime. Refreshing on those is delaying the job for no reason.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid these delays, but also make sure single requests are responsive we need to:\r\n\r\n- Use `WAIT_FOR` for requests that are a result of a user action\r\n- Use `NONE` for internal requests\r\n- Reduce the `refresh_interval` to a value that is responsive without putting pressure on the index (e.g. `100ms`)? Note the config index is a low volume index so it should be able to handle quick refreshing.","closed_by":{"login":"dimitris-athanasiou","id":9351617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTE2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9351617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitris-athanasiou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
