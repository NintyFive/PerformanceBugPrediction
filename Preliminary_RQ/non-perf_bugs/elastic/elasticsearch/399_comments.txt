Assuming a box with 16 Gb RAM and two cores, which will lead to Nodes 0 and 1 created by the NUMA system. We don't want swapping and we disable it, but if node 0 exhausted off free memory, node 1 hasn't, and a process scheduled on node 0 needs something, wouldn't this lead to a crash?\n\nWe are deploying to a NUMA system (unix OS) with ES_HEAP_SIZE=50% of RAM, bootstrapp.mlockall = true, file descriptors = 64000, ulimit -l unlimited and sometimes the box crashes. \n\nTrying now to get more details from logs, maybe check if the OOM killer logged something and If I found more I will come back with details.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
