The fact it has a broadcast address like that (which looks totally bogus), means that if the user configures 0.0.0.0, we will fail. I can fix the logic to deal with it in several ways (the interface is not marked up, we can not do the check explicitly for a wildcard address) but if anyone understands this I'd love to know why this docker interface looks like that.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
