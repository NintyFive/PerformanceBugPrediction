Data needs to be part of the cluster/index state in order to be persisted.  So now we need to write this to disk every time  document is indexed.\n\nElasticsearch already has a bunch of caching built in.  Most of the time you can just run your queries/aggs and rely on Elasticsearch to do the caching for you.  In the small number of cases where you want external caching, you could use a simple max agg on a timestamp field to check whether the external cache should be purged.  Enable result caching on the max agg and even that check becomes very light.\n\nI think existing functionality is a better answer than adding an index timestamp.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/145038308","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13830#issuecomment-145038308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13830","id":145038308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTAzODMwOA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-02T14:29:30Z","updated_at":"2015-10-02T14:29:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It just occurred to me that this could be implemented in a much simpler lighter way: most recent refresh time.
