For 7.6 the syntax is `dotProduct(params.query_embed,  'my_vector')`","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/589099762","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45243#issuecomment-589099762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45243","id":589099762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4OTA5OTc2Mg==","user":{"login":"csenol","id":158265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODI2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/158265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csenol","html_url":"https://github.com/csenol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csenol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csenol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csenol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csenol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csenol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csenol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csenol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csenol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csenol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-20T15:11:35Z","updated_at":"2020-02-21T08:48:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes I was using it in sort.\r\n```\r\n { \"query\" : {\"exists\" : { \"field\" : \"my_vector\" }},\r\n    \"sort\" : {\r\n        \"_script\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"number\",\r\n            \"script\" : {\r\n                \"lang\": \"painless\",\r\n                \"source\": \"dotProduct(params.query_embed, doc['my_vector'])\",\r\n                \"params\" : {\r\n                    \"query_embed\" : [1,2,3]\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n            \"order\" : \"asc\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the release notes of [7.5.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/release-notes-7.5.0.html)\r\n\r\n>Ranking\r\nAdd vector functions to the Sort Script Context #45244 (issue: #45243)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean then?
