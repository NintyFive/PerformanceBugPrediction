Previously we had a `key` value that was a long and a formatted 'key_as_string' - now we just have a single `key` value with an ugly encoding as can be seen in this screenshot:\n![sense - a json aware

IPV6 I expect and consequently the shift to StringTerms for the buckets.\nI'm not sure how much of a problem the ugly `key` is is but I will add back a friendlier \"key_as_string\" addition for readable IP addresses.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/214476578","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17705#issuecomment-214476578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17705","id":214476578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDQ3NjU3OA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T18:47:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T18:47:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jpountz
