That solution allows us to be sure that there is an index template (so we don't accidentally get default mappings) and allows applications that manage index templates to manage whether auto-creation should be allowed or not, rather than having a cluster-level setting.\r\n\r\nRegarding this proposal, my biggest concern is overloading hidden indices with too much meaning. Currently, the hidden/visible status of an index only impacts wildcard resolution (at wildcard expansion time and at index template matching time, though in different ways), and I think keeping it that way would probably be for the best. That said, I'm potentially open to expanding the definition if we would gain a large enough benefit from doing so.\r\n\r\nI guess my core question is this: What would doing this get us that https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20640 doesn't?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/664603835","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56369#issuecomment-664603835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56369","id":664603835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NDYwMzgzNQ==","user":{"login":"gwbrown","id":1522844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjI4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1522844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/gwbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwbrown/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-27T19:51:35Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T19:51:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We discussed this in today's Fix-It meeting. The conclusion we reached was that this approach has only minor benefits over the approach of a flag on an index template as in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20640, and allowing auto-creation based on the hidden-ness of an index mixes together two separate ideas that we would rather keep separate. Especially since hidden-ness is determined by an index setting that may be changed at any time.
