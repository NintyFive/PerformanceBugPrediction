I guess locking/unlocking the resources index should not be exposed via api, otherwise anybody can use it and do whatever they can? \n\nI don't think this is any different than locking APIs like creating indexes or updating mappings. The \"resources\" api should be able to have a block on modifications. This is the same as e.g. blocking other metadata actions (and yes I view this as metadata, even though the underlying impl would be in a special index. I'm not sure what indexes scripts are classified as today).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/293495094","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10959#issuecomment-293495094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10959","id":293495094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzQ5NTA5NA==","user":{"login":"tsullivan","id":908371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/908371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsullivan","html_url":"https://github.com/tsullivan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsullivan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsullivan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsullivan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsullivan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsullivan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsullivan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsullivan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsullivan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsullivan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-12T07:19:46Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T07:19:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would this possibly alleviate the current pain point requirement to close and re-open the index to re-read the synonym database?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/338242083","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10959#issuecomment-338242083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10959","id":338242083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODI0MjA4Mw==","user":{"login":"garyui","id":11842618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODQyNjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11842618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyui","html_url":"https://github.com/garyui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyui/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-20T15:36:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T15:36:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I agree - closing and reopening the index , or restarting each node in the cluster, one by one, is very painful.
