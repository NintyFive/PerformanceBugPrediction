Using it, and using the special purpose zen discovery that was built to handle it, auto discovery of nodes can be implemented just using the cloud APIs.\n\nThis menas that no multicast is required, no elastic IPs, and no special gossip routers. All nodes are created equal!.\n\nHere is a sample configuration:\n\n```\ncloud:\n    account: <Account ID Here>\n    key: <Private Key Here>\n    compute:\n        type: ec2 / cloudservers\n\ndiscovery:\n    type: cloud\n```\n\nThe discovery by default has a `discovery.cloud.ports` range setting that is set to `9300-9302`. These are the default transport ports used by elasticsearch (its `9300`, but if its taken, the next one will be used). Make sure to enable communication between nodes in the cloud (internally, not externally) on at least port `9300` (usually, a single node per VM is enough).       \n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
