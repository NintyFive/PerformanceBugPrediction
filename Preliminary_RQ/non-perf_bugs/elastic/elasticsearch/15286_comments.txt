The transport client is just a client (it does not create a node, so no script service).\n\nI would guess that you are missing groovy in your classpath, which would cause the 2.1 code to skip registering groovy as a script language. Most likely you were using a shaded jar in 1.6, which we no longer have in 2.x, meaning you must include dependencies yourself when using ES as a client.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/162838382","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15286#issuecomment-162838382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15286","id":162838382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjgzODM4Mg==","user":{"login":"dimitris-athanasiou","id":9351617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTE2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9351617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitris-athanasiou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T10:07:37Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T10:07:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the explanation!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
