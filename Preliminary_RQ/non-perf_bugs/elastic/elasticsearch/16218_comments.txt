This is indeed suboptimal and not expected behaviour.\n\nSimple reproduction:\n\n```\nPUT index\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"parent\" : {\n    },\n    \"child\" : {\n      \"_parent\": {\n        \"type\": \"parent\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT /index/parent/1\n{ \n}\n\nPUT /index/child/1?parent=1\n{ \n}\n\nGET /index/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"has_child\": {\n      \"type\": \"child\",\n      \"query\": {\n        \"match_all\": {}\n      },\n      \"inner_hits\" : {}\n    }\n  },\n  \"inner_hits\" : {\n    \"my-inner-hits\" : {\n      \"type\" : {\n        \"child\" : {\n\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTwo inner hits are expected here, but instead only the top level inner hit is returned.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
