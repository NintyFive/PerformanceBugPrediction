It works from the datatype of a field to determine the kind of inputs that are accepted not the other way around. If you want to dynamically detect numbers inside strings you can activate the [numeric detection](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/dynamic-field-mapping.html#numeric-detection) (disabled by default) in the dynamic field mapping.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
