I\"d like to be able to define the index names the template works for as a regex and not a wildcard, and to be able to use capture groups from the regex inside the template definition. So, in my example, you can assign a template to catch specific format of index names, and automatically create a child type where the parent is derived from the captured index name.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/47657301","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3312#issuecomment-47657301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3312","id":47657301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjU3MzAx","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-01T13:44:22Z","updated_at":"2014-07-01T13:44:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i'm -1 on this.  It just introduces a level of complexity that i'm uncomfortable with, plus it is not bwc.  Currently we allow simple patterns (ie shell globbing). We can't support those and regexes in the same place without having some flag... ie more complexity.\n\nElasticsearch should support common use cases simply, and allow more complex stuff to be done via the app.  I don't think the API should be bent to support corner cases, as it makes it more complex (and likely buggier) for everybody.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
