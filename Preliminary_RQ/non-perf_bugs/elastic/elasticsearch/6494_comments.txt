If wildcards are used, then they should match the full path, not the short version.  Additional thought: it would be nice to allow `*` to match just one step in the path, and `**` to match across dots, so, given fields:\n- `name.first`\n- `name.first.raw`\n- `name.last`\n- `name.last.raw`\n\nThis pattern `name.*` would match only `name.first` and `name.last`, while `name.**` would match all four fields.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68391467","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6494#issuecomment-68391467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6494","id":68391467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzkxNDY3","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-30T19:57:46Z","updated_at":"2014-12-30T19:57:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing in favour of #8870\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
