The expected behavior should give exact matches higher score than fuzzy matches.  \n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Create the search index with the provided index settings ([index.txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/459299/index.txt))\n2. Insert the documents with the following values for the field \"username\": user100, user1000, user1001, user1002, user1003, user1004 \n3. Execute the multi_match query ([query.txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/459300/query.txt))\n4. The first few results are \"user1000\", \"user1001\", \"user1002\" etc. instead \"user100\"\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**: /\n\nThis issue is a duplicate of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3125.
