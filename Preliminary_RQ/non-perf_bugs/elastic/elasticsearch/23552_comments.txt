This comes from the thing we are using to track our slow journey to 100% CONSOLE snippets. It's rules are:\r\n0. If something is marked `NOTCONSOLE` it doesn't have to be converted no matter the rules below.\r\n1. If the language is `sh` and the snippet contains `curl` then it must be converted.\r\n2. If the language is `js` and the snippet isn't marked as `CONSOLE` then it must be converted.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the snippets in that doc are either `js` or have `curl` in them.
