As part of this, new algorithms have been added including BM25.  Also as part of the changes, it is now possible to define a Similarity per field, giving even greater control over scoring.\n### Configuring Similarity per Field\n\nDefining the Similarity for a field is done via the `similarity` mapping property, as this example shows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"book\" : {\n    \"properties\" : {\n      \"title\" : { \"type\" : \"string\", \"similarity\" : \"BM25\" }\n    }\n} \n```\n\nThe following Similarties are configured out-of -box:\n- `default` - The Default TF/IDF algorithm used by Lucene in previous versions\n- `BM25` - The BM25 algorithm.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25 for more details\n\nAdditionally, functionality for configuring the following Similarities is provided:\n- `DFR`\n- `IB`\n### Configuring Similarity Properties\n\nMost existing or custom Similarities have configuration options which can be configured.  This is done via index settings as shown below:\n\n```\n\"similarity\" : {\n  \"my_similarity : {\n    \"type\" : \"DFR\",\n    \"basic_model\" : \"g\",\n    \"after_effect\" : \"l\",\n    \"normalization\" : \"h2\",\n    \"normalization.h2.c\" : \"3.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere we configure the DFRSimilarity so it can be referenced as `my_similarity` in mappings.\n### Default and Base Similarities\n\nBy default, ElasticSearch will use whatever Similarity is configured as `default`.  However, the Similarity functions `queryNorm()` and `coord()` are not per-field.  Consequently, for expert users wanting to change the implementation used for these two methods, while not changing the `default`, it is possible to configure a Similarity with the name `base`.  This Similarity will then be used for the two methods.\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrismale","id":1080664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1080664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale","html_url":"https://github.com/chrismale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
