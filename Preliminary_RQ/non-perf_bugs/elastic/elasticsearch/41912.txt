My VPS was running an old Java version, so I downloaded OpenJDK 11 and set the following to both my .bash_profile and .bashrc:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport JDK_HOME=/path/to/jdk\r\nexport JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk\r\nexport PATH=/path/to/jdk/bin:$PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow when I run `java -version` from my SSH console, I get version 11. So far so good. But when I run `./bin/elasticsearch` as per [the install instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/zip-targz.html), I get the following two lines and then my console crashes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Option UseConcMarkSweepGC was deprecated in version 9.0 and will likely be removed in a future release.\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: UseAVX=2 is not supported on this CPU, setting it to UseAVX=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can find no logs anywhere or any clue as to why it crashes. I suspect that maybe Elasticsearch  is trying to write files somewhere my VPS is forbidding, because before I figured out what versions I needed, I tried installing the latest Elasticsearch (which comes bundled with the latest OpenJDK and is not supported on Ubuntu 14.04) and got the same warnings and crash.\r\n\r\nAnyone has a clue on what may be going on or how to find out?? Any help is appreciated, thanks!","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
