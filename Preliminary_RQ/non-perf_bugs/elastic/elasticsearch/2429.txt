For example, when the query is just \"i\" or even something more complex like \"i AND you\", stopword analysis will leave a clause without any terms.  \n\nIn this situation, both Lucene and ElasticSearch view the clause as an empty-set of terms which matches nothing.  However users often would prefer the clause to instead be a MatchAll Query, matching every document.  \n\nCurrently `MatchQuery` has hardcoded behaviour that uses `MatchNoDocsQuery` in this situation.  Instead we should allow users to provide a flag as part of a `match` query that gives them control over what to do when there is an empty-set clause.\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrismale","id":1080664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1080664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale","html_url":"https://github.com/chrismale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
