Also I believe it is only pluggable for the \"plain\" highlighter.  I think you have two options:\n1.  Submit a patch to Elasticsearch that adds a your fragmenter.\n2.  Submit a patch to Elasticsearch that allows you to plug new fragmenter into the plain highlighter and then implement your fragmenter as a plugin.\n3.  Submit a patch to the [experimental highlighter plugin](https://github.com/wikimedia/search-highlighter) that implements your fragmenter there.\n\nI'm partial to number 3 because I maintain that plugin.  Despite the name its really quite stable.  We served eight and a half million searches with it yesterday.  I chose the name to reflect that I'd release it more frequently the Elasticsearch or Lucene.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/295268780","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6810#issuecomment-295268780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6810","id":295268780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTI2ODc4MA==","user":{"login":"aanchal9","id":13236637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjM2NjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13236637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aanchal9","html_url":"https://github.com/aanchal9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aanchal9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aanchal9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aanchal9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aanchal9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aanchal9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aanchal9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aanchal9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aanchal9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aanchal9/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-19T13:24:06Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T13:24:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is it still an issue?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/295272302","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6810#issuecomment-295272302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6810","id":295272302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTI3MjMwMg==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-19T13:35:14Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T13:35:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We're moving away from the `plain` highlighter and plan to deprecate it in favor of the `unified` highlighter.
