If you reverse the order (or just remove applying testclusters as it is applied by esplugin), you only get the latter error, for which there are workarounds described #49813 and #49956. I'm addressing that in #50249.\r\n\r\n> These types of problems occur very frequently. It'd be really nice if you had a simple plugin that is not part of the ES build but rather invoked as a forked GradleBuild task (with a local pseudo-maven repository for example).\r\n\r\nWe sort of had this, but the way it was setup was causing spurious failures for unrelated reasons that were very difficult to debug. We want to add them back in some fashion. The general idea is to use the `plugins/examples` build files and tweak them to use a locally build maven repo, thus they should trigger all the \"external\" code. I'm going to close this issue as the problem of compiling in 7.5 is addressed by the linked PRs.
