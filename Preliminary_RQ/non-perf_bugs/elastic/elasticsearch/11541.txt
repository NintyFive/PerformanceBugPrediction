I noticed this because on upgrading the install of elasticsearch on www.gov.uk searches including the word \"news\" started returning results containing only the word \"new\".\n\nThe changes between porter2 and porter are relatively small in terms of the number of words affected, but include changes to fix some pretty common problems like this based on observation of probems with the algorithm in 20 years of production systems.  In general the problems fixed are problems with over-stemming words - conflating too many different forms together.  I know that a lot of people end up using the \"light_english\" (an alias for \"kstem\") stemmer, which stems a lot less strongly, and I suspect part of the reason for that is that they've been using the \"porter\" stemmer initially instead of the \"english\" stemmer.\n\nI'd encourage you to consider returning to \"porter2\" the default algorithm when people ask for english (perhaps at elasticsearch 2.0 for compatibility reasons), because it really is quite noticeably better for result quality.  We made \"porter2\" the algorithm returned when snowball is asked for an english stemmer for this reason.\n\nMartin Porter's opinion last time I talked to him about this (and also my opinion) is that the \"porter\" algorithm is significantly worse than the \"porter2\" algorithm.  The only reason we kept the \"porter\" algorithm in snowball is that a lot of academic evaluations have historically been done using the \"porter\" stemmer, and it's convenient for them to be able to use the same algorithm for new tests for accurate comparison of results.  I would never deliberately use \"porter\" in a production system.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rboulton","id":73564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/73564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rboulton","html_url":"https://github.com/rboulton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rboulton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rboulton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rboulton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rboulton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rboulton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rboulton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rboulton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rboulton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rboulton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
