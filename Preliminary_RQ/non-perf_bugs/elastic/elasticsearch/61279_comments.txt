I am pretty sure this was caused by [this VLong/ZLong issue](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/54911/files#diff-e6deefb95c3fa58ba7be8b2b36cb766dR122). We couldn't really figure out a clean way to deal with it back then. Fixing it would require quite a bit of version archeology to figure out when we introduced the bug, fixed the bug and switched to the new version of serialization. Considering a low impact and complicated change, I would propose close/won't fix it, unless it starts popping up more. @polyfractal what do you think?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/689074732","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/61279#issuecomment-689074732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/61279","id":689074732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4OTA3NDczMg==","user":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-08T19:01:18Z","updated_at":"2020-09-08T19:01:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hmm, yeah, I'm inclined to mark as close/won't fix.
