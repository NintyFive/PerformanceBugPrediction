The node info API shows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            \"generic\": {\r\n               \"type\": \"cached\",\r\n               \"keep_alive\": \"30s\",\r\n               \"queue_size\": -1\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe confusing part is that the default for the `cached` thread pool *type* is 5 minutes but the only thread pool that can use that thread pool type is the `generic` pool which overrides it to 30 seconds. I have removed that confusing part now from the docs.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
