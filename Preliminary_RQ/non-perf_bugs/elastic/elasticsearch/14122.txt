The fault and update domain specifications in Azure are in the form of numbers (eg. 0, 1, 2, 3, etc..):\n\nCurrently, using force awareness, we will have to specify:\n\n```\n    \"cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes\":\"updateDomain,faultDomain\",\n    \"cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force.updateDomain.values\": \"0,1,2,3,4\"\n    \"cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force.faultDomain.values\": \"0,1\"\n```\n\nIt will be helpful to provide a way for the force awareness settings to handle numeric values.   In this case, it will be nice to be able to just list the maximum number of fault and update domains. That way, when nodes come and go, we will always have the maximum list â€“ even when we add nodes after the deployment which might use update domains not used yet in that deployment.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
