this, however, it would be good to check the release notes for the versions you are skipping to make sure there aren't any breaking changes that will impact you, in particular, if you're upgrading to 1.4.2, you should check the [1.4.0-beta1 release notes](http://www.elasticsearch.org/downloads/1-4-0-beta1/) which lists the breaking changes between 1.3.x and 1.4.x (it is a small list)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/69555086","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9249#issuecomment-69555086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9249","id":69555086,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTU1MDg2","user":{"login":"dobariya","id":10497122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk3MTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10497122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya","html_url":"https://github.com/dobariya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dobariya/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-12T11:04:18Z","updated_at":"2015-01-12T11:04:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
