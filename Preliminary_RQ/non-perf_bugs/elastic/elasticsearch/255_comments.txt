These two metrics can be used to identify the weight of a shard, probably biasing the search volume. \n\nPerhaps the shard sizes could also contribute.\n\nIn my current clustered setup, the load is not symmetrical. I believe that this is because shard allocation is not smart enough to know where to put each shard to avoid hot spotting. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/388098","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/255#issuecomment-388098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/255","id":388098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODA5OA==","user":{"login":"ppearcy","id":307414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzQxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/307414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy","html_url":"https://github.com/ppearcy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-09-03T23:11:37Z","updated_at":"2010-09-03T23:11:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This ticket should be superseded by:\nhttp://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues#issue/353\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
