The plugins script doesn't read nor validate such settings but if you start Elasticsearch with that setting it will fail. I'm closing this as not a bug. However, do you see documentation for 5.x that indicates this is a valid setting? If so, we will need to correct the docs. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
