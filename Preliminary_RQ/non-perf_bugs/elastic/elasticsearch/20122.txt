The issue is to represent the merit of instead requiring the `lang` option always. I will offer up some initial benefits that I can see with this:\n- consistency - for Stored Scripts (previously Indexed Scripts) and file based scripts the language is required in some form or another (URL path, filename, etc.). But it is not for inline scripts. I'm not sure if there is a historical reason for this or not.\n- expectation - if it is required then a user will know what to expect when their script is run; for simple scripts it is possible the syntax may work in multiple languages but is that desirable? When an engineer is writing a script they probably know what language they are writing for so why not have this be explicit? Especially as a script may evolve in the future as application requirements change\n- language changes - thinking forward as languages change if there are certain items that are not backwards compatible then it would give the option for a user to control this as they convert/migrate their scripts. For example `painless` and the `painless-v2`\n\nJust some initial options/rationale in regards to why I had mentioned it on the [original PR](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/20017#issuecomment-241640776) of where the topic came up.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
