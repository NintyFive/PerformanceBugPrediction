This would solve the following problem.\r\n\r\n1. We are currently using shared indices for our customers. We would like to have ability to have premium customers isolated from free customers. Since we are using a custom plugin for a custom search, the search performance depends on the disk IO performance. We don't want high disk queues for premium customers.  Also since we are on cloud storage which is subject to throttling, we would want to isolate the premium customer from getting throttled. \r\n\r\n2. We can move to HDD for non premium customers vs SSD for premium ones. also hot and cold indices can be handled in this manner.\r\n\r\n3. Selective disk encryption for sensitive data: We have sensitive data which we would like to be encrypted. Since encryption is prone to slowness, it would make sense to have encrypt only selective disks and not all of them.","closed_by":{"login":"rkalhans","id":5341933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDE5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5341933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans","html_url":"https://github.com/rkalhans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkalhans/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
