However, if keystore is reloaded dynamically, the errors are not reported. \r\n\r\nThis is a problem in the Cloud, because a user may add a value to keystore, and then, possibly months later the cluster would start bootlooping after an unrelated change. \r\n\r\nMaking the behavior consistent in either of two ways would solve the problem: either make reload API fail and return an error if settings are invalid, or allow startup process to continue even if a key is not recognized. \r\n\r\nMy preference would be the latter option: I think there are valid use cases when a user would want to add values to keystore before configuring the rest of functionality. \r\nFor example, a domain admin might add ldap secrets to the cluster, without having to coordinate with the cluster owner to configure rest of the settings. \r\n\r\n/cc @tvernum ","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
