you don't mind I would like to work on this and will submit a pull request in the upcoming days.\r\n\r\n@tlrx  Please tell me if I got this right: `type` in case of an analyzer can be any of those listed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/b04faa059b50bfd8c55a5704c5bca432439ec85d/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/indices/analysis/AnalysisModule.java#L242\r\nplus any of the additional analyzers coming from the installed plugins.\r\n\r\nSo, when customizing analyzers there are two options:\r\n\r\n- if `type` is in the list of built-in analyzers (`standard`, `keyword`, etc) then the new analyzer will be the built-in + your settings changed\r\n- if `type` is custom - you can define your own chain of character filters/tokenizer/token filter (basically DIY analyzer from the building pieces available).\r\n\r\nIf this is correct, I will work on how to integrate this information into the documentation page and will submit a pull request.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
