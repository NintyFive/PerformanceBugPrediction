I access some parts of the docs in the client side without parsing due to heavy client-side filtering and joining requirement) and preparing a switch to the Java REST client from the transport one, I thought either CBOR or SMILE may benefit my case at least due to more efficient encoding of the binary chunks.\r\n\r\nAlso recently I got across a project involving client-side processing of huge buckets of aggregation results, and am thinking the binary formats may be beneficial in those cases in terms of performance.\r\n\r\nIf CBOR/SMILE are to be deprecated for removal soon, please communicate the fact clearly as soon as possible.
