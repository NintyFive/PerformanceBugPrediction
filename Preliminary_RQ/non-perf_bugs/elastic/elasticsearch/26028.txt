to [the documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/5.6/java-rest-high-document-bulk.html#java-rest-high-document-bulk-processor), you \"only\" need to write the following code to create a Rest Bulk Processor:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        ThreadPool threadPool = new ThreadPool(Settings.EMPTY);\r\n        BulkProcessor.Listener listener = new BulkProcessor.Listener() {\r\n            @Override public void beforeBulk(long executionId, BulkRequest request) { }\r\n            @Override public void afterBulk(long executionId, BulkRequest request, BulkResponse response) { }\r\n            @Override public void afterBulk(long executionId, BulkRequest request, Throwable failure) { }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        bulkProcessorDoc = new BulkProcessor.Builder(client.getHlClient()::bulkAsync, listener, threadPool).build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is actually failing with empty settings as the `ThreadPool` class [is waiting for a `node.name` setting](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/threadpool/ThreadPool.java#L166):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        assert Node.NODE_NAME_SETTING.exists(settings);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think we should either remove the need for the node name when configuring a Client ThreadPool or to document that this is needed for now:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        ThreadPool threadPool = new ThreadPool(Settings.builder().put(Node.NODE_NAME_SETTING.getKey(), \"high-level-client\").build());\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder though if the High Level Rest Client itself should not provide OOTB a default ThreadPool with a name like `high-level-client`.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
