Shard stays in initializing state and following does not clear the condition.\n\n1) Attempts to reassign ( Message below)\n2) Reboots of nodes with shard having issue resident\n3) Change of replicas from 4 to 2\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Run a cluster and fill up the disk on some node\n2. Have other indices with continuous writes\n3. wait until shards start showing unassigned\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n\n2016-04-19 22:32:35] {\"error\":{\"root_cause\":[{\"type\":\"illegal_argument_exception\",\"reason\":\"[move_allocation] can't move [logstash-feeder-df-2016.04][1], shard is not started (state = INITIALIZING]\"}],\"type\":\"illegal_argument_exception\",\"reason\":\"[move_allocation] can't move [logstash-feeder-df-2016.04][1], shard is not started (state = INITIALIZING]\"},\"status\":400}\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
