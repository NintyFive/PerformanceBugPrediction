I downloaded the [zip packaging](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-1-7-5). The line that you point out does not appear in the batch files. I do not think there is a bug here, I think that you have a bad package, I'm not sure where from. Feel free to open a topic on the [Elastic Discourse forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) if you need additional help troubleshooting. Please note that you'll have to give more detail instructions on reproducing.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
