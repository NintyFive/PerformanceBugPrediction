Iâ€™m currently using a data generator to provide an expected result in ElasticSearch, I should be getting a record every minute in ElasticSearch, but sometimes the documents don't get indexed at all. I've excluded the possibility that this might be caused by Logstash since I briefly replaced it with Kafka Connect and behaved the same way. Kafka is returning the event since I can consume it with a different process. Logstash has no filtering whatsoever and it should just send data to ES. \r\n\r\nI've increased the `thread_pool.writes.queue_size` and the behavior still persists. The logs are not showing anything. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
