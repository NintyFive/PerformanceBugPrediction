I'd like to replace it with `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager` (from AWS SDK v1.11.211) which takes care of uploading objects using one or multiple requests, potentially by executing them concurrently.\r\n\r\nWith the security manager enabled and all the legacy code in the S3 plugin the change is not that simple but I'd like to do it soon. I think we can expect less GCs, less allocations, less connections issues and upload should be faster too. That's also the opportunity to prepare the field for AWS SDK v2.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
