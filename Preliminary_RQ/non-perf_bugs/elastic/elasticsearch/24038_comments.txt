If you're sending 150 MB down the pipe and you haven't increased this setting, then Elasticsearch is going to close the connection.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, Elastic provides a [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co) for asking general questions and instead prefers to use GitHub only for verified bug reports and feature requests. There's an active community there that should be able to help get an answer to additional question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/337879737","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24038#issuecomment-337879737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24038","id":337879737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzg3OTczNw==","user":{"login":"asafm","id":989425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTQyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/989425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asafm","html_url":"https://github.com/asafm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asafm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asafm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asafm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asafm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asafm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asafm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asafm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asafm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asafm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-19T11:28:18Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T11:28:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Happened to me too, so it's good that it was here :)\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
