What happens here is that \"event\" is interpreted as a type, and our field resolution resolves it to the root of the json object. And since elasticsearch does not index objects (only actual fields), when you search on an object, it internally translates `\"exists\": \"my_object\"` to `\"exists\": \"my_object.*\"` in order to match fields. So in your case elasticsearch searches for documents that have a field that starts with `.`, and none of them does.\n\nThis will hopefully be fixed when #8872 is fixed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
