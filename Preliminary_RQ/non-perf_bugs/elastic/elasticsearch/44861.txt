Both elasticsearch seem to run correctly when I used a browser to access them. For reference, I used docker run -d --name elasticsearch --net tasotest -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" elasticsearch:7.2.0 to run elasticsearch.\r\nI expect the function to run correctly\r\n\r\nHowever, I instead receive the error \"Exiting: Couldn't connect to any of the configured Elasticsearch hosts. Errors: [Error connection to Elasticsearch http://localhost:9200: Get http://localhost:9200: dial tcp [::1]:9200: connect: cannot assign requested address].\" After searching for the solution online, I decided to modify the elasticsearch.yml file in the image so that host is set to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0.. I then learned that it is not possible to edit an image pulled from the docker hub. How do I repair this issue?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n 1. Pull Filebeat image\r\n 2. Pull Kibana image\r\n 3. Pull estaticsearch image\r\n 4. docker run -d --name kibana --net tasotest -p 5601:5601 kibana:7.2.0\r\n 5. docker run -d --name elasticsearch --net tasotest -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" elasticsearch:7.2.0\r\n 6. docker run docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:7.2.0 setup -E setup.kibana.host=localhost:5601 -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=[\"localhost:9200\"]\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"andyb-elastic","id":29205940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjA1OTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29205940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic","html_url":"https://github.com/andyb-elastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
