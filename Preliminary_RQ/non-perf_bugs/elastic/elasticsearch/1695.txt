discussed in the mailing list, here is a feature request.\n\nI would like to be able to define an alias for an index while I'm creating the index.\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/twitter/ -d ' \n{ \n  \"settings\": { \n    \"number_of_shards\": 3, \n    \"number_of_replicas\": 2 \n  }, \n  \"alias\": [ \n    \"myalias\" \n    ] \n} \n'\n```\n\nIt would be nice to have in the Java API also :\n\n``` java\nCreateIndexRequestBuilder cirb = client.admin().indices().prepareCreate(index);\ncirb.setSettings(source);\n// New method here\ncirb.setAlias(\"myalias\");\ncirb.execute().actionGet();\n```\n\nHere is the signature expected for setAlias method : `setAlias(String... alias)`\n\nDiscussion here :
