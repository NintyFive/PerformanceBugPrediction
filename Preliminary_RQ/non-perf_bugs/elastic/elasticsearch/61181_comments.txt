If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. The discussion forums are better suited to these sorts of conversations around solution design.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the forums that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
