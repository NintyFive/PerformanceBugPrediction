version**: elasticsearch-6.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT\n\n**Plugins installed**: ingest-geoip\n\nThe Ingest Simulate process overwrites existing properties in the source document if they are named the same as a property that ingest uses internally.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\nMaking the following simulate request:\n\n```\nPOST _ingest/pipeline/_simulate?verbose=true\n{\n  \"pipeline\": {\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"processors\": [\n      {\n        \"set\": {\n          \"tag\": \"set_1\",\n          \"field\": \"foo\",\n          \"value\": \"bar\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n
