Say I have a file abc.docx and it contains the word \"shark\" in it. If I search for \"sha\", it returns the file abc.docx. However, if I search for \"shar\", it does not return that file i.e it seems to process only 3 character search strings while doing content search. I checked this in the latest version(1.5.0) and version 1.4.3 as well and it din't work either. This seems to be working in Elasticsearch 1.4.2.
