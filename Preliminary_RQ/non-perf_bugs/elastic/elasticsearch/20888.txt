Apart from the fact that requiring static code blocks for extension points is far from ideal, there is no mechanism that prevents code from registering custom cluster state parts after a node has started (i'm not sure what the behaviour is when this happens).\n\nInstead we should have a `ClusterStatePlugin` interface that plugins can implements that allows registering custom cluster state, metadata and or index metadata. The interface should have 3 default methods that allows to register the 3 different custom cluster state parts that exist today.\n\nAlso as far as I know there is nothing that registers custom index metadata, so I wonder if we can remove that.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
