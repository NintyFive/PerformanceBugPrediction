This issue implements what has been requested and discussed in #10869, #23546.\r\n\r\nI opened separate pull request (m31collision/elasticsearch#1) in forked repo, please, have a look. Of cource, it is not ready for pulling here and it is implemented for 2.3 version only because we use mainly this version on our prods. It is not used on prod yet, only tests.\r\n\r\nIt has durty code without tests, but I need to know - is it acceptable for you for further development? It seems to me this implementation has no shortcomings mentioned in those issues.\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
