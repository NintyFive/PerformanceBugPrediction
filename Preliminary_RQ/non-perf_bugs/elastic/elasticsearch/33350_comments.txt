I think the problem is that it takes some time for the indices to restore themselves from the snapshot. The restore is async and is not completed when the call to `_snapshot/ot_repo/curator-20180827215825/_restore` comes back. Until the recovery is completed, no data is available for search causing the exceptions you see.\r\n\r\nYou can monitor its progress by calling `GET _recovery?active_only=true`. If want the restore call to wait for the recovery to completed you can add a `wait_for_completion=true` query string parameter, but it can take a long time.\r\n\r\nIf this ends up being something else, please open a thread on our [discuss forums](http://discuss.elastic.co)  so we can figure out there what's going on and open an issue if needed.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
