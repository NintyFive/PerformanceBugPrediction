Now we can make sense of this situation. Sadly, I think that you've been led astray by documentation that needs improvement.\n\nIf you have a remote cluster, your client node needs to be configured to talk to that cluster. This means that at a minimum, you have configure the discovery layer so that the client node can reach the cluster, and the client node needs to be bound to a network device that can reach the cluster (e.g., if the cluster is on a remote machine, you can't bind the client node to its loopback device). If you're using simple unicast zen discovery (the default), you can just specify a hosts list (it's enough to specify the master-eligible nodes, and I consider this a best practice). In my case, I will start a single node cluster on my workstation:\n\n```\n$ ES_JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms4g -Xmx4g\" ~/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-5.0.0-alpha5/bin/elasticsearch -E network.host=_eno1_ -E discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes=1\n```\n\nI'm binding to one of this machine's ethernet devices named `eno1` which has IP address 192.168.1.179.\n\nOn my laptop, I will start a client node (as you're trying to do) pointing to this node:\n\n```\n$ ES_JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms4g -Xmx4g\" ~/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-5.0.0-alpha5/bin/elasticsearch -E node.data=false -E node.master=false -E discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts=192.168.1.179 -E network.host=_en0_ -E discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes=1\n```\n\nI'm binding to this machine's wireless device named `en0` which has IP address 192.168.1.92.\n\nNow on my laptop I edit the `kibana.yml` to point to this client node:\n\n```\nelasticsearch.url: \"http://192.168.1.92:9200\"\n```\n\nand start Kibana and have success:\n\n```\n14:17:49 [jason:~] $ ~/kibana/kibana-5.0.0-alpha5-darwin-x86_64/bin/kibana\n  log   [14:17:56.329] [info][status][plugin:kibana@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready\n  log   [14:17:56.363] [info][status][plugin:elasticsearch@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from uninitialized to yellow - Waiting for Elasticsearch\n  log   [14:17:56.389] [info][status][plugin:console@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready\n  log   [14:17:56.400] [info][status][plugin:kbn_doc_views@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready\n  log   [14:17:56.402] [info][status][plugin:kbn_vislib_vis_types@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready\n  log   [14:17:56.406] [info][status][plugin:markdown_vis@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready\n  log   [14:17:56.418] [info][status][plugin:metric_vis@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready\n  log   [14:17:56.421] [info][status][plugin:spy_modes@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready\n  log   [14:17:56.423] [info][status][plugin:status_page@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready\n  log   [14:17:56.426] [info][status][plugin:table_vis@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from uninitialized to green - Ready\n  log   [14:17:56.438] [info][listening] Server running at http://0.0.0.0:5601\n  log   [14:17:56.439] [info][status][ui settings] Status changed from uninitialized to yellow - Elasticsearch plugin is yellow\n  log   [14:18:01.432] [info][status][plugin:elasticsearch@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from yellow to yellow - No existing Kibana index found\n  log   [14:18:02.047] [info][status][plugin:elasticsearch@5.0.0-alpha5] Status changed from yellow to green - Kibana index ready\n  log   [14:18:02.047] [info][status][ui settings] Status changed from yellow to green - Ready\n```\n\nand on my workstation:\n\n```\n[2016-08-12 14:16:31,783][INFO ][cluster.service          ] [lbWdifM] added {{rLXgiug}{rLXgiugpT2Cq9NRPHT-hfA}{pDuDqfgDRoSH8eoG_aSu8A}{192.168.1.92}{192.168.1.92:9300},}, reason: zen-disco-node-join[{rLXgiug}{rLXgiugpT2Cq9NRPHT-hfA}{pDuDqfgDRoSH8eoG_aSu8A}{192.168.1.92}{192.168.1.92:9300}]\n[2016-08-12 14:18:01,614][INFO ][cluster.metadata         ] [lbWdifM] [.kibana] creating index, cause [api], templates [], shards [1]/[1], mappings [server, config]\n[2016-08-12 14:18:04,558][INFO ][cluster.metadata         ] [lbWdifM] [.kibana/w8Uhj1BWTeKNkI2wtX5YBw] create_mapping [index-pattern]\n```\n\nshowing that the `.kibana` index was created through the client via Kibana.\n\nI hope this helps.
