I had documents taking literally days to return form the extract phrases logic. I have a test that reproduces the problem and a possible fix. The reason for this is that the FVH never tries to early terminate if a phrase is already way beyond the slop coming from the phrase query. If there is a document with lot of occurrences or two or more terms in the phrase this literally tries to match all possible combinations of the terms in the doc. I don't think we can fix this FVH without rewriting it since this alg is freaking crazy and somehow `n!` of all the positions etc. I am not even sure what the Big-O of this is but I have a patch that tires to prevent this thing from going totally nuts.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
