The primary in network-1 continues to have the same `term` value (10 in this example)\n5) The connection between the networks is re-established.\n\nIn this case we need a strategy for reconciling the differences in the indexes, if there were change operations in both the networks. Does a strategy like that exist today? So far it seems like this situation is preventable by using min_master_nodes. However in case min_master_nodes is not set appropriately, some default strategy should come into effect I would think.\n\nAn example strategy could be:\n1) Keep logs of write operations in both networks for a configurable amount of time. If the networks' connectivity is restored within this time period: (a) Drop all nodes in network-2 to read-only replica status (b) Attempt to reconcile the differences, and use network-1's state if the differences are not reconcilable. (c) Remove read-only status\nIf the connectivity isn't restored within that time, when connection is restored, all indices in network-2 that have competing primaries in network-1 will lose their shards, and replicas are created from network-1.\n\nAnother interesting situation (scenario-2) to consider:\n1) Continuing with the scenario described above until (4) ...\n2) network-1 has another split, creating network-1 and network-1a. Network-1a gives `term` value of 11 to the new primary in that network.\n4) network-1 completely fails, and connectivity between network-1a and network-2 are restored. Now we may have a scenario where the subsequent change operations might not fail but still lead to different indexes in the replicas, with some operations failing some of the time, creating a messy situation.\n\nThis would happen if there is no reconciliation strategy in effect.\n\nI do see that the sequence numbering method will keep shards that have connectivity to both the networks, in integral state, in the case of scenario-1. In the case of scenario-2, it is possible that the same shard gets operations with same `term` values from multiple primaries, and that again could create faulty index in that replica.\n\nI am still trying to understand Elasticsearch's cluster behavior.

I rather enjoy all these discussions and your comments.\n\n> The current strategy, which seq# will keep enforcing but in easier/faster way, is that all replicas are \"reset\" to be an exact copy of the primary currently chosen by the master.\n\n## \n\n> The situation will be resolved when the network restores and the left over primary and replica sync\n\nI would like to clearly understand the reset/sync scenarios. What triggers reset/sync?\n\nI can think of a couple of \"normal\" operation scenarios\n1) I would think that whenever a node joins a network, the master would initiate a sync/reset. \n2) If a replica fails for a request, I suppose the primary should keep attempting a sync/reset, otherwise the replica might keep diverging, and at some point the master has to decommission that replica, otherwise the reads would be inconsistent.\n\nIn the case of split brain, with multi-network replicas (assuming min master nodes is set), primary-1 has been assuming that this replica R (on this third node, say N-3) has been failing (because of its allegiance to primary-2 ) but still is in the network. Hence it would attempt sync/reset. How does this protocol work? Should master-1 attempt to decommission R at some point, going by assumption (2)?\n\nThis problem will occur in a loop if R is decommissioned but another replica is installed on N-3 in its place, by the same protocol. There will be contention on N-3 for \"reset\"-ing replica shards by both the masters.\n\nI suppose one way to resolve this is by letting a node choose a master if there are multiple masters. If we did this, then whenever a node loses its master, it would choose the other master, and there will be a sync/reset and all is well.\n\nHowever if the node chooses its master, the other master will lose quorum, and hence cease to exist, which is a good resolution for this issue in my opinion.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/193683857","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10708#issuecomment-193683857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10708","id":193683857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzY4Mzg1Nw==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-08T09:19:28Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T09:19:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The two issues you mention indeed trigger a primary/replica sync.
