Since key validation is a relatively expensive operation, especially when a key is not yet cached, this could lead to GET thread pool saturation. Once the pool is saturated, API key creation fails with a 401 error, which is misleading.\r\n\r\nTwo issues could possibly be improved:\r\n* Move API key validation outside of the GET thread pool\r\n* Change the 401 error to a more appropriate error, e.g. 429.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywangd","id":2344308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDQzMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2344308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd","html_url":"https://github.com/ywangd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywangd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
