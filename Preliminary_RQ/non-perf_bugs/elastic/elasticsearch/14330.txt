Referring  to issue #9726 where in @clintongormley mentioned that if one of the shard takes a longer time to respond, the search context gets expired on other shards which results in this exception. The reason for slower shard could be gc running on that particular node.\n\nFirstly ours is not a scan and scroll request and this is a normal search request. \nWe have a 3 node cluster and the exception stack trace was found on the master node where first SearchContextMissingException exception we got was for the master node itself and then within same second we got another exception for the 3rd node.\n\nThe master node printed this exception for 15-20 times and after that logs vanished. Somewhere nearly 12 hours the master got shut down with other nodes in the cluster reporting error \"reason: zen-disco-master_failed\".\n\nThe logs are currently in the debug mode and none of the node reported any kind of garbage collection. \nIts been nearly 2 years since we are using ES in production. This issue of node shutting down is very frequent in past one month.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
