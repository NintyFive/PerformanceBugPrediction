We don't have any rules regarding arabic characters as it seems that it's not part of the standard unicode segmentation rules that the tokenizer uses (it can split on some eastern language):\r\nhttp://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/\r\nYou could use the `type_table` option of the `word_delimiter_graph` but that would mean mapping all possible arabic characters.\r\nI don't have a good solution for this so the best would be to ask on the Lucene mailing list or to open an issue in Lucene's jira directly. The `word_delimiter_graph` (as the `standard` tokenizer) is defined in Lucene so it's better to ask there.
