(a 200 response is expected for the bulk API - you have to check the responses to the individual items to know whether they succeeded or not).\n\nI suggest checking the successful responses to see what index they went to.\n\nEither way, 1.4.1 is very old and we won't be doing any further releases of that branch.  If you do find something that looks like a bug, please could you try to confirm this in a more recent version.\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
