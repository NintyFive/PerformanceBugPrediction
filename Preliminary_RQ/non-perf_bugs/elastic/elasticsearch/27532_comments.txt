The Headers you are mentioning are to be interpreted by a browser which should not interact directly with Elasticsearch. These returned resources are not to be interpreted by a browser, but by a JSON parser which does not care about the HTTP Headers.\r\n\r\nYou might want to take this to the https://github.com/elastic/kibana repo. Kibana is serving ES results in a form consumable by a browser.\r\nHowever these Headers should not be present on every resource served by Kibana, if any. You should argue why a certain path is vulnerable if the Header is missing. We have throughly tested Kibana for XSS and CSRF. A generic tool warning is unlikely to arouse interest.\r\n\r\nAlso, if security is your concern you should consider upgrading the stack. The versions you have mentioned have exceeded *end of life* and any security bugs that we find have not been backported for quite a while now...","performed_via_github_app":null}]
