I understand what has been deprecated, my question is more around the docs themselves. There is no reference to a Java API in either of the `analysis-synonym-tokenfilter` or `analysis-synonym-graph-tokenfilter` so I am having a hard time understanding why we are putting this notice to users on these pages. Regardless, I will prepare a PR with a notice regarding the deprecation.\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed that both `elasticsearch/analysis/common/WordDelimiterTokenFilterFactory.java` and `elasticsearch/analysis/common/CommonAnalysisPlugin.java` use `WordDelimiterFilter` rather than `WordDelimiterGraphFilter`. Should I open a separate issue to change these usages to `WordDelimiterGraphFilter`?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/426006934","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24665#issuecomment-426006934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24665","id":426006934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjAwNjkzNA==","user":{"login":"lcawl","id":26471269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDcxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26471269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl","html_url":"https://github.com/lcawl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcawl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-01T18:09:36Z","updated_at":"2018-10-01T18:09:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@j-haj If you haven't already started the documentation PR, I can do it. \r\n\r\nWith respect to your second comment, it looks like there's already an issue here: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29061","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/538508807","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24665#issuecomment-538508807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24665","id":538508807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzODUwODgwNw==","user":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-04T18:21:13Z","updated_at":"2019-10-04T18:21:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"[docs issue triage]\r\n\r\nLeaving open as this is still relevant.\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n\r\n- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-word-delimiter-tokenfilter.html\r\n- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-word-delimiter-graph-tokenfilter.html","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/624342963","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24665#issuecomment-624342963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24665","id":624342963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDM0Mjk2Mw==","user":{"login":"debadair","id":362578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjU3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/362578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair","html_url":"https://github.com/debadair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-05T22:37:21Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T12:46:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this, as @jrodewig's  change adds the notice that word-delimiter-tokenfilter is deprecated in Lucene.
