So when we get to parsing the second clause of the query, the `movie` mapping is first checked, and it finds there is a mapping for `genre.name`, which has a simple name of just `name`, and that matches the field of the second clause.  The query actually ends up being `+genre.name:foo +genre.name:foo`.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/58515071","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8030#issuecomment-58515071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8030","id":58515071,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTE1MDcx","user":{"login":"caseywebdev","id":1181237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODEyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1181237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseywebdev","html_url":"https://github.com/caseywebdev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseywebdev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseywebdev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseywebdev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseywebdev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseywebdev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseywebdev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseywebdev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseywebdev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseywebdev/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-09T14:13:13Z","updated_at":"2014-10-09T14:13:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rjernst can you think of any workarounds other than renaming the type or property name?
