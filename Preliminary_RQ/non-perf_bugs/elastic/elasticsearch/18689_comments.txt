The reason for the error message is because the plugin script passes something like `-Edefault.path.conf=/Users/jason/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-5.0.0-alpha3/config` to the `org.elasticsearch.plugins.PluginCli` Java class as a program argument. When you specify a command, this argument will trickle down to the appropriate sub-command. However, since you have not, `org.elasticsearch.plugins.PluginCli` itself is attempting to parse, but this command-line argument does not mean anything to the top-level class. I'm afraid there is not an issue here, but please let us know if you think otherwise?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/223126773","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18689#issuecomment-223126773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18689","id":223126773,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzEyNjc3Mw==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T21:14:14Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T21:14:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is a bug IMO.
