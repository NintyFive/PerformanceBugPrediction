Since you have a central store to describe your documents, it would be nice if you could add metadata that helps the application use that data as well.  Otherwise they have to store it in a similar schema in another system for that purpose.  \n\nBy adding more data into the mappings, you can write more dynamic clients that can consume the index without having to have so much knowledge about every field but can read it from the schema as needed.\n\nI'm not too caught up on this one, was just thinking out loud.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
