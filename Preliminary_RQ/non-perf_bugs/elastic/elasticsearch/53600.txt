To prevent a dependency on [Value Source Refactor](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42949) from further delaying the release of `geo_shape` doc values and aggregation support, a temporary solution of registering geo aggregations in the X-Pack spatial plugin is suggested by using the module framework. Much like the approach to [overriding doc_values parameter](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53263), the `SearchModule` class will register geo_ aggregation implementations through a thin OSS `geo` module that provides the base classes necessary to implement Basic+ functionality in the X-Pack `spatial` module (when the appropriate license level is available). In this manner, the OSS implementations will only be registered absent a Basic+ license. \r\n\r\nThis approach allows the geo_shape doc value feature to move forward independent of any additional work to the aggregation framework paving the way to potentially release the feature earlier than anticipated.    \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"iverase","id":29038686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDM4Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/29038686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase","html_url":"https://github.com/iverase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iverase/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
