In your example, the `disabled` mapping implicitly has type `object`. You can see that the `enabled` parameter is not supported for other mapping types like `boolean` by trying out the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT test\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"_doc\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"field\": {\r\n          \"type\": “boolean”,\r\n          \"enabled\": true\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returns the error `\"Failed to parse mapping [_doc]: Mapping definition for [field] has unsupported parameters:  [enabled : false]”`.\r\n\r\nWhen an object field is disabled, it is possible to add non-object data to it because the field parsing is skipped entirely. This is why you are able to pass longs to the `disabled` field in the example.\r\n\r\nI opened to #40989 update the documentation -- maybe you’d be able to take a look to see if it helps clarify these points? I also tried to improve the wording around \"only to the mapping type and to object fields\".\r\n\r\n> It is possible but thinking this through Elasticsearch should throw an error given that am I doing an aggregation over enabled: false field (disabled).\r\n\r\nIn general, elasticsearch will not throw an error if a user attempts to query or aggregate on an object field, and instead treats it as an 'unmapped' field. I think the current behavior around using disabled fields in searches is consistent with that, and that we wouldn't want to throw an error just in the case that `enabled: false`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/481201165","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37941#issuecomment-481201165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37941","id":481201165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTIwMTE2NQ==","user":{"login":"bphenriques","id":4727729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjc3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4727729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphenriques","html_url":"https://github.com/bphenriques","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphenriques/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphenriques/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphenriques/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphenriques/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphenriques/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphenriques/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphenriques/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphenriques/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphenriques/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-09T10:47:51Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T10:47:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey @jtibshirani !
