there,\n\nwe have successfully been using integer representations of javascript Date objects for the \"seed\" property of the \"random_function\" scoring function, i.e. output of the following function:\n\n```\nfunction seedval(max_age) \n{\n    var ma = max_age || 60000;\n    return Math.ceil(+new Date() / ma) * ma;\n}\n```\n\nwhich results in numbers like:\n\n> 1414573200000\n\nyesterday a colleague built and installed ES from source using the 1.x branch and stumbled upon the following error (it was definitely referring to the value set for \"random_score.seed\"!)\n\n```\nJsonParseException[Numeric value (1414573200000) out of range of int\n```\n\n> NB: I am not looking for a fix as such (we decided to simply divide our generated seed values by 1000 thereby solving our immediate problem) \n\nI am creating this issue because it just might be something that you would consider to be a regression, I have no idea which of the following might be true ... so by all means close this issue if you consider it to be irrelevant :) \n1. we are running ES as a 32bit process (not the case AFAICT)\n2. this is an intentional change/fix\n3. this is an unintentional change/bug - possibly related to upgrading (or introducing?) the Jackson lib, from which the parse error seems to originate.\n\nhope this is of some use, thanks for reading!\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
