We try to use this space to report issues or propose feature requests.\n\nThat said, you'll basically need to reindex your data. You can scan and scroll your data and reindex in another index. If you were using aliases (which is a good practice BTW), just switch the alias to the new index and your users won't see the difference.\nThen remove the old index.\n\nClosing.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
