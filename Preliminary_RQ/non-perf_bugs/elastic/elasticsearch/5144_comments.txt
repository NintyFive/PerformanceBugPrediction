If I understand correctly, it would force all 4 nodes to stop working at all - means: no service at all. This wouldn't cover the case, that two nodes are taken down for maintenance work. And what if there a three DCs (each with 2 nodes) - a setting of minimum_master_nodes=5 would only allow one node to fail before ES stops working.\n\nIMHO there should be a regular job inside ES, that checks the existence of other nodes (either via unicast or via multicast) and triggers (re-)discovery if necessary - the split brain situation must be resolved.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/35293698","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5144#issuecomment-35293698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5144","id":35293698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjkzNjk4","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-17T15:36:35Z","updated_at":"2014-02-17T15:36:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Exactly. Cluster will stop working until network connection is up again.\nWhat do you expect? Which part of the cluster should hold the master in case of network outage?\n\nCross Data center replication is not supported yet and you should consider:\n- use the great snapshot and restore feature to snapshot from a DC and restore in the other one\n- index in both DC (so two distinct clusters) from a client level\n- use Tribe node feature to search or index on multiple clusters\n\nI think we should move this conversation to the mailing list.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
