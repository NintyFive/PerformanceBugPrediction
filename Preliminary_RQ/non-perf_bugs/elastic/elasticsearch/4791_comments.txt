The functionality that you describe is quite dangerous.  Elasticsearch uses the version numbers for its own internal tracking. If you force the version numbers not to change, you're very likely to lose data.\n\nReally the only options are to retry on conflict, to set a high external version number, or to just reindex the document ignoring version numbers.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
