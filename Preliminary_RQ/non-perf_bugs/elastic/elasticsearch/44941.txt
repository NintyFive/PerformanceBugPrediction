Is it possible to have an API endpoint that returns a CSV response -- similar to the one calcuated by Kibana ? \r\n\r\nI think the logic for converting  ES-JSONs to CSV is already available in Kibana, maybe the same logic could be implemented in ES, thereby allowing us to directly get CSV output for different queries/aggregations made on ES. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering my issue/request, and for the wonderful search engine of yours :)","closed_by":{"login":"eskibars","id":2246002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDYwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2246002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars","html_url":"https://github.com/eskibars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
