We use github for feature requests and confirmed bug reports. Regarding limits in `rollup` search, this API can be used for aggregations only so you cannot retrieve `top_hits` (the `size` is always set to 0). For `sql` there is an open issue about `offset` [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31549).\r\nAs such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
