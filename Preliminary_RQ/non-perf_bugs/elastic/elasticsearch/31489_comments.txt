would love to have this, but it is technically difficult given the current settings code.  When launching the keystore cli, we do not load plugins, yet plugins can have secure settings. In order to validate which settings are allowed (and their type, eg string vs file), we would need to load this information from all plugins. But we do not want to actually load plugins. A long time ago @s1monw was working on a prototype for separating constructing the plugin class (where we could get the setting objects from), and and initialization of the plugin, but I don't know where that was left off.
