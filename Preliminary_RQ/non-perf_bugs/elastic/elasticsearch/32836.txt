Usually APIs that kick off tasks offer the option to `wait_for_completion` or not.  However, the delete job API does not; the endpoint always waits for completion.\r\n\r\nAs part of the \"Optimizing job deletion\" project for 6.5 we should add a `wait_for_completion` flag to  the delete job endpoint (default `true` to match historic behaviour).  If set to `false` the endpoint should return as soon as the deletion task is started, and return the task ID in its response.","closed_by":{"login":"dimitris-athanasiou","id":9351617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTE2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9351617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitris-athanasiou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitris-athanasiou/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
