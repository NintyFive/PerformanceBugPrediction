Feature request -->\r\n\r\n**Describe the feature**:\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful if there was more robust documentation around the query string parameter for _cat api calls. I see in some cases you can query on a field value like : **_cat/indices?v&health=yellow** but you can't always do that. For instance trying to get a list of shards that only apply to the a specific node\r\n**GET _cat/shards?v&node=1234** doesn't work. And although it would be a bigger win for these all to work I understand that is a larger feature. It would just be nice to specify where and when you can use query parameters and which ones you could use.","closed_by":{"login":"lockewritesdocs","id":25848033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODQ4MDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25848033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs","html_url":"https://github.com/lockewritesdocs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
