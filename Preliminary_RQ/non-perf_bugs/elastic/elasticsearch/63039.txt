I believe we intend to support monitoring a 6.x cluster using a 7.x monitoring cluster as well.  In other words, the monitoring cluster is 1 major version backwards compatible with the monitored cluster.  Would be nice to confirm that there are no edge case exceptions and document this accordingly.
