If you need to change the mapping of a field, create a new index with the correct mappings and reindex your data into that index. If you only want to rename a field, consider adding an alias field.\r\n\r\nReindex API:\r\n\r\n> Reindex does not attempt to set up the destination index. It does not copy the settings of the source index. You should set up the destination index prior to running a _reindex action, including setting up mappings, shard counts, replicas, etc.\r\n\r\nUsers might find it helpful if we went a step further to document a hands on example (e.g code snippets that can be run in Console) to demonstrate exactly how to use the reindex API to accomplish this.\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-put-mapping.html#updating-field-mappings\r\n[2] https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
