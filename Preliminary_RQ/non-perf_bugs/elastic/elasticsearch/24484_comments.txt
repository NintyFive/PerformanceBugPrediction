Implementing this on the client side when you know what fields you want to rename is easy.  Doing so in a generic way in Elasticsearch has many more corner cases.  `partial_fields` never allowed the renaming of fields, only filtering.  In Elasticsearch, we prefer not to implement things that can be done more simply on the client side, as the added complexity and edge cases is not worth the gain","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/299474426","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24484#issuecomment-299474426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24484","id":299474426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTQ3NDQyNg==","user":{"login":"jaisharma639","id":8330173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzAxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8330173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639","html_url":"https://github.com/jaisharma639","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-05T14:08:48Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T14:08:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1.

Anyways its deprecated now , so no point discussing it.\r\n\r\n2. Well its not that easy to do it on the client side as it involves iterating through the huge response i'm returning. I use the helpers.scan method to return a generator from elasticsearch and have to loop through entire response just to rename each field in each record of response. These kind of features have always been there in any data store but lack in elasticsearch.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/372954385","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24484#issuecomment-372954385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24484","id":372954385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjk1NDM4NQ==","user":{"login":"jaisharma639","id":8330173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzAxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8330173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639","html_url":"https://github.com/jaisharma639","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaisharma639/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-14T09:19:55Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T09:19:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Does my comment above make sense?
