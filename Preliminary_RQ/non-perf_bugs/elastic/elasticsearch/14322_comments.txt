Assuming you use ES 1.7, I can reliably create large arrays of objects with large fields (just tried it with 10000 array entries, 10000 chars), although Sense for me freezes on such large documents, but curl works just fine. I think there are two problems with the test code:\n- just calling `execute()` on the IndexRequestBuilder will return a Future, but that only starts the index operation. If your test now aborts, the cluster might not have received it. Instead, like when issuing an index request via REST, you should wait for the response using `execute().actionGet()`. there's even a handy shortcut for this with the `get()` method on all ActionRequestBuilders. \n- also close the client after you are done with it\n\nPlease let me know if this solves your issue.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/152016661","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14322#issuecomment-152016661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14322","id":152016661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjAxNjY2MQ==","user":{"login":"ane18s","id":15350989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzUwOTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15350989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ane18s","html_url":"https://github.com/ane18s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ane18s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ane18s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ane18s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ane18s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ane18s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ane18s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ane18s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ane18s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ane18s/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-28T22:27:08Z","updated_at":"2015-10-28T22:27:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"THANK YOU!!!
