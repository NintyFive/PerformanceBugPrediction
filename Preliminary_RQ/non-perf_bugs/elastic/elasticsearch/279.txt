Assuming the following indexed json:\n\n```\n{\n    \"pin\" : {\n        \"location\" : {\n            \"lat\" : 40.12,\n            \"lon\" : -71.34\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen the following simple query can be executed with a `geo_distance` filter:\n\n```\n{\n    \"filtered\" : {\n        \"query\" : {\n            \"match_all\" : {}\n        },\n        \"filter\" : {\n            \"geo_distance\" : {\n                \"distance\" : \"12km\"\n                \"pin.location\" : {\n                    \"lat\" : 40,\n                    \"lon\" : -70\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n## Accepted Formats\n\nIn much the same way the `geo_point` type can accept different representation of the geo point, the filter can accept it as well:\n\n_Lat Lon As Properties_\n\n```\n{\n    \"filtered\" : {\n        \"query\" : {\n            \"match_all\" : {}\n        },\n        \"filter\" : {\n            \"geo_distance\" : {\n                \"distance\" : \"12km\"\n                \"pin.location\" : {\n                    \"lat\" : 40,\n                    \"lon\" : -70\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n_Lat Lon As Array_\n\n```\n{\n    \"filtered\" : {\n        \"query\" : {\n            \"match_all\" : {}\n        },\n        \"filter\" : {\n            \"geo_distance\" : {\n                \"distance\" : \"12km\"\n                \"pin.location\" : [40, -70]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n_Lat Lon As String_\n\n```\n{\n    \"filtered\" : {\n        \"query\" : {\n            \"match_all\" : {}\n        },\n        \"filter\" : {\n            \"geo_distance\" : {\n                \"distance\" : \"12km\"\n                \"pin.location\" : \"40,-70\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n_Geohash_\n\n```\n{\n    \"filtered\" : {\n        \"query\" : {\n            \"match_all\" : {}\n        },\n        \"filter\" : {\n            \"geo_distance\" : {\n                \"distance\" : \"12km\"\n                \"pin.location\" : \"drm3btev3e86\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n## Options\n\nThe following are options allowed on the filter:\n- `distance`: The distance to include hits in the filter. The distance can be a numeric value, and then the `distance_unit` (either `mi`/`miles` or `km` can be set) controlling the unit. Or a single string with the unit as well.\n- `distance_type`: How to compute the distance. Can either be `arc` (better precision) or `plane` (faster). Defaults to `arc`.\n## `geo_point` Type\n\nThe filter does not require the `geo_point` type to be set. It assumes that the location object indexed includes a `lat` and `lon` numeric values. The `geo_point` type follows these rules and allows for more flexible indexing options / structure, but is not required.\n## Multi Location Per Document\n\nThe `geo_distance` filter can work with multiple locations / points per document. Once a single location / point matches the filter, the document will be included in the filter.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
