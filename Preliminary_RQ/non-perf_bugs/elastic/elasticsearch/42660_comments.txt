The main motivation is that we are striving for a uniform experience for all users of Elasticsearch, regardless of artifact/packaging format and want a common approach on how to adjust heap size for Elasticsearch. This should be possible by looking at our [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/heap-size.html), [discuss forums](discuss.elastic.co) and [blog articles](www.elastic.co/blog), i.e. setting it via `jvm.options` or the environment variable `ES_JAVA_OPTS`. If we change the approach for Docker only, we'll need to have a lot of _if_ clauses in our documentation and forums, and every time we deal with a question we have to branch out our checklists based on whether we are running on Docker.\r\n\r\n2. We make [ergonomic choices for direct memory](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/42006), in particular for `MaxDirectMemorySize` by inspecting -Xms/-Xmx (set in `jvm.options` or overriden via `ES_JAVA_OPTS`), so this mechanism wouldn't work anymore if we rely on heap autodetection via `-XX:+UseContainerSupport`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/547158581","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42660#issuecomment-547158581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/42660","id":547158581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzE1ODU4MQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T21:42:18Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T21:42:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Note that point 2. here is no longer valid since #41962 since we inspect the heap size as the JVM would see it, whether or not it is set explicitly.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
