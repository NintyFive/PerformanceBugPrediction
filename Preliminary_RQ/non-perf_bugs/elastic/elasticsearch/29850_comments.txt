We need more concrete arguments for it.\r\n\r\nThe downsides for an admin role are:\r\n- Customers who just do everything as `elastic` won't use it.\r\n- Customers who don't read the docs won't use it\r\n- Customers will see 2 options in the Kibana UI and be confused about which one they want\r\n- Customers _should_ design their own roles to grant the correct privileges for their needs - this direction implies that we want to take this on for them, and we don't.\r\n- It will open up discussions, issues & PRs disagreeing on what an \"admin\" role should be allowed to do. Should it be allowed to delete `.ml-*` or `.monitoring-*`, etc? I don't know and I'm nore sure we want to open that can of worms.\r\n\r\nI'm not strictly _opposed_ to doing this, but it's not _free_ and it will cause a different set of issues. So would need to be sure that it's going to be a net improvement.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/418743364","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29850#issuecomment-418743364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29850","id":418743364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODc0MzM2NA==","user":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-05T14:05:06Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T14:05:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The team discussed this in our meeting today. We believe that the addition of another built in role will not alleviate the issue; its like root on linux, knowing that things should not run as root, having the tools to not run as root, yet running as root is still prevalent. Additionally, each user may have different desires for the role such as being able to run as or not run as.\r\n\r\nGiven this, we are closing this issue as something we will not do. A different idea did come out of the discussion which is the idea of a wizard in Kibana to walk a user through creating their own admin style role. This is something that could be explored/considered in the future.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
