The problem here is that the highlighter does not try to extract the part of the span query that matches the text but rather checks which terms inside the span query could appear in the span. This leads to false positive like in the provided example. I think it's possible to fix but it would be in Lucene land.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/248365092","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20555#issuecomment-248365092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20555","id":248365092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODM2NTA5Mg==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T17:02:44Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T17:02:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @jimferenczi. @alwag85 I'd consider opening an issue in Lucene, to see if anybody is interested in fixing it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
