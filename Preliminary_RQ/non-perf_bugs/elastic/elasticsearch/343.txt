The `local` gateway allows to perform full cluster recovery using only the local information stored on each node. This include both recovering the full cluster state (indices created, mappings defined) as well as each index data.\n\nIt is important to configure the `gateway.recover_after_nodes` setting to include most of the expected nodes to be started after a full cluster restart. This will insure that the latest cluster state is recovered.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
