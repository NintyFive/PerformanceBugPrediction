There's an example here: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/8d50c102081903d3faf3fa0d1204539677a6be24/x-pack/plugin/ml/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/ml/job/process/autodetect/AutodetectProcessManager.java#L105\r\n\r\nAlso, because the new settings are going to be dynamic, you need to store the dynamic value in a variable somewhere, and register a callback to update it when the user updates the setting.
