Set fielddata=true on [field] in order to load fielddata in memory by uninverting the inverted index. Note that this can however use significant memory.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat makes sense, but given that we now by default have the raw version of the field, shall we print out some suggestion like \"use [field.keyword] instead\"?
