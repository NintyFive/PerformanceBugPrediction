a stricter format is much more efficient than the optional formats for date-fields using DateTimeFormatter. For time-series use-cases, the format for a date rarely changes over time- hence it would be easier to infer the right format during parsing and then use it with a fallback on user provided/default formats. This would really help improve the parsing overhead during indexing.\r\n\r\nThe stricter could be adaptively inferred whenever a optional format is used and can be auto-corrected when the date parsing fails with the optional format, with some limit on auto-correction count over time.\r\n\r\nI saw close to 5% improvement in indexing throughput on http_logs benchmark just by changing the format from optional to stricter.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pgomulka","id":11137008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTM3MDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11137008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka","html_url":"https://github.com/pgomulka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
