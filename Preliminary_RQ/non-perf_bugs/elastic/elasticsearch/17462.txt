We show multiple merges being performed on the _cat/nodes api, however, _stats/merges shows no merges being performed for any index.  We are not sure what is the true merge activity on the cluster.  Also, is there a way to see what shards are bing merged?\n\n![cat-nodes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6633418/14191693/f8057626-f75e-11e5-9a62-10c0c76de164.png)\n![stats-merges](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6633418/14191712/0a9e1cf2-f75f-11e5-85f9-27187f099f09.png)\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n We are not sure how the cluster gets into this state.  We have experienced this multiple times.  We have not found a way to clear what we think are stuck merges without bouncing the nodes.\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
