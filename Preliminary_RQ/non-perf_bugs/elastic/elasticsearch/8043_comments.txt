This dev server was running 1.3.2. The server was moved to 1.4.0.Beta1, then moved back to 1.3.2. This generated errors due to a missing Lucene jar file (obviously). Then the developer upgraded again to 1.4.0.Beta1. It is at this point that we started experiencing this issue.\n\nI would imagine that this flawed process resulted in the anomalous behavior. I had thought this was a fresh install at the time when I opened this ticket. We've removed the old indexes and started fresh and all works well. As it was a dev server it was easier to just remove everything and start over. Since then we cannot recreate the issue or have a test case to work with. Chalk it up to user error perhaps.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
