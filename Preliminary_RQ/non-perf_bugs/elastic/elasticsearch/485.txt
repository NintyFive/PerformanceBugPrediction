The analyzer will be used for any field that does not explicitly defines an `analyzer` or `index_analyzer`.\n\nHere is a sample mapping:\n\n```\n{\n    \"type1\" : {\n        \"_analyzer\" : {\n            \"path\" : \"my_field\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above will use the value of the `my_field` to lookup an analyzer registered under it. For example, indexing a the following doc:\n\n```\n{\n    \"my_field\" : \"whitespace\"\n}\n```\n\nWill cause the `whitespace` analyzer to be used as the index analyzer for all fields without explicit analyzer setting.\n\nThe default `path` value is `_analyzer`, so the analyzer can be driven for a specific document by setting `_analyzer` field in it. If custom json field name is needed, an explicit mapping with a different `path` should be set.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
