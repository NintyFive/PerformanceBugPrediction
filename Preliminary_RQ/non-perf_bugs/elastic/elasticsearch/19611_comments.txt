Say hello to your reality check.\n\nThe problem is, the packages and the layout go hand in hand, and both contribute to making abnormally long file names:\n- `src/main/java` can be `src/java`\n- `src/main/resources` can be `src/resources`\n- `src/test/java` can be `src/test`\n- `src/test/resources` can be `src/test-resources`\n\nThe packaging starts with the abnormally long `org.elasticsearch` which could easy be `org.elastic` or something better, but it doesnt end there. It sometimes goes to hierarchies 6 or 7 deep, which is totally unnecessary. More than 99% of these hierarchies are undocumented.\n\nThat is a disorganized mess, and it makes super long file names which cause problems with e.g. copy-paste, overflowing terminals, all kinds of stuff. Tab completion or fancy IDEs does not fix the problem.\n\nSo yea, I'm sorry to have to be the one to say, that this is crap, but its crap. I will repeatedly emphasize this because it is the reality. It is not bullying. It is perfectly acceptable to voice a negative opinion: I will make sure you that recognize this.

I pointed out the \"too many java packages\" as an aside to reinforce `this is an easy change that could help with navigating to every single class in the source`\n\n> but I am not sure how much typing this change would help saving\n\nIt saves 5 characters, for _every single class_. Note in Robert's comments before, he does not use tab completion. But even with tab completion, this saves on an extra 2 characters (`j`-`<TAB>` once  you are under `src/test`.\n\n> Plus I don't see it as a debate between \"everybody who uses the IDE\" vs \"everybody who uses the shell\". Most of us use both IDE and shell and what I personally see being annoying on the shell is the number and the depth of java packages, which is a different problem.\n\nSure, everybody uses the shell, but not for the same purpose.  And it's not a different problem: depth of directory structure _is_ the problem. Again, this proposal would help with _every single class_.\n\nThe cherry picking argument is valid. But we successfully moved the entire src for 2.x, and it did not halt all bugfixes back to 1.7.x. We also have very few patches going back to 2.x even now (and I would bet fewer once 5.0 is out).\n\nI opened this discussion now because we are very close to branching for 5.0. A major version branching is really the only time to do large source moves (again, like we did in 2.0), so if we are going to make this change, it needs to be soon. I would ask that those of you who have -1'd to think if this is actually something that would hurt your development, or if it is worth blocking for those that do feel it would help.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/235565708","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19611#issuecomment-235565708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19611","id":235565708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTU2NTcwOA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T12:05:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T12:05:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rmuir I'm in favour of the change.

That's not my point. The point is that 90% of java devs are using today `src/main/java` and `src/test/java` in their projects.\nI know some projects where they are using `ant` and they adopted the exact same organization as it will be easier then to migrate to Maven or Gradle.\n\nGradle also [adopted those defaults](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html).\n\nThat's why I'm -1 on this change until the convention changes.\n\n## Too many packages\n\nI do agree about this. I wrote more than a year ago in a private issue that we should split the core in modules and make every module more isolated, testable on its own... So it would drastically reduce the number of packages per module. Ideally one module should contain a very limited number of packages.\n\nAlthough I agree on this, I don't think that we should fix the lack of modularity we have today with a \"false fix\".

Remember\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's quote: \"The reasonable person adapts themselves\nto the conditions that surround them, while the unreasonable person\nadapts surrounding conditions to them.  Therefore, all progress\ndepends on the unreasonable person.\"\n\nI also dislike the \"one person is being a 'bully' so now I veto this\nissue\" approach: that just amplifies/echo-chambers the effect of one\n'bully' and results in a fragile/big-company culture going forward.\nYou should rather do the opposite (minimize the impact) by calling out\nthe 'bullying', and then disregarding it and getting back on point\n(technical arguments) instead: that's what heals a community, makes it\nnaturally resilient to 'bullying'.\n\nPainful cherry-picking is a one-time cost, vs an expected loooong\nfuture benefits of less ongoing taxation.  Saying this matters is much\nlike arguing Lucene can't make a cool change since it would hurt\nbackwards compatibility, and that used to hold back a great many good\nLucene changes but guess who changed that broken culture in Lucene a\nfew years back :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/236160723","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19611#issuecomment-236160723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19611","id":236160723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjE2MDcyMw==","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-29T11:48:31Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T11:48:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mikemccand Nobody argues here that breaking backwards compatibility is always bad or that we should strictly follow standards and not try to be lean.

I value the standard layout for its internal and external consistency. Regarding external consistency, the argument is simply that most Java projects use exactly this layout. Regarding internal consistency, look at\n\n```\n- src\n  - java\n  - resources\n  - test\n  - test-resources\n```\n\nvs\n\n```\n- src\n  - main\n    - java\n    - resources\n  - test\n    - java\n    - resources\n```\n\nThe former feels inconsistent in the naming (why is `java` and `test` on same directory level?
