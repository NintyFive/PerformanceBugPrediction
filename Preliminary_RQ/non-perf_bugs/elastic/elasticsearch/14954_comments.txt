Thanks for clarifying.\n\nWould it be worth considering responding with an error to clients if they try to read from the scroll API from more than one request at the same time? Despite it being incorrect usage I am still able to do it and it results in broken behaviour. I'm thinking this'd be particularly helpful preventing async clients from accidentally overlapping their requests.\n\nAlso, perhaps a note could be added to the docs [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/search-request-scroll.html](docs) about this.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
