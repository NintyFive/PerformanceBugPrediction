It would be great to nail down one at a time.\n\nFirst, what is your jgroups discovery module configuration? \n\nSecond, regarding the single node starting and not recovering from the gateway, can you please set the `gateway.fs` logging to `TRACE` in the `logging.yml` file and post the log of that server (the part where it starts up and does not read it)?\n\nThird, the other problems, of nodes not discovering each other. Thats a bit of a nasty one. Lets see what your jgroups configuration is and continue from there...\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/175575","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/102#issuecomment-175575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/102","id":175575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTU3NQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-04-01T20:52:42Z","updated_at":"2010-04-01T20:52:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My jgroups config:\n\nnetwork:\n       bindHost: 10.224.103.159\n    discovery:\n           jgroups:\n                   config: tcp\n                   tcpping:\n                           initial_hosts: 10.224.103.159[7800],10.224.103.48[7800],10.224.118.127[7800]\n\nI set my logging to:\n    rootLogger: INFO, console, file\n    logger:\n         jgroups: WARN\n\n```\ngateway:\n     fs:      TRACE\n```\n\nOr should that be this instead?\n    gateway.fs:   TRACE\n\nBtw, the issue of not seeing the index until two nodes have started only seems to happen after I've had a bad shutdown eg couldn't snapshot or something like that\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/175577","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/102#issuecomment-175577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/102","id":175577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTU3Nw==","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-04-01T20:57:01Z","updated_at":"2010-04-01T20:57:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Configuration looks good.
