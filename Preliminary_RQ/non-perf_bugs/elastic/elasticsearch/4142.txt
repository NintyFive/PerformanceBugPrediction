Even though the bool filter doesn't have a `minumum_should_match` open the bool filter behaves as if `minumum_should_match` is set to 1.\n\nThis behaviour is inconsistent with the bool query and I would like to see that the bool filter works the same as the bool query with regards to the should clauses, so in the case should clauses are defined when there are must_not or must clauses then the should clause are irrelevant. If there are only should clauses defined a document just needs to match with a single should clause.\n\nI don't think we should support `minumum_should_match` option as is in bool query (makes bool filter execution expensive), but maybe have an option that enables <= 0.90.x behaviour.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
