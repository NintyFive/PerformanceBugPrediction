Should we be able to name the function then use the function result in other functions.\n\nFor example, \n\nI have one function which perform a calculation using document fields. With that calculation, I want to use the result to determine two different values. Without ability to refer to calculated function, I have to do the same calculation twice to get the result.\n\nPlus, naming thing seems to be a standard way for Elasticsearch structured it's query.
