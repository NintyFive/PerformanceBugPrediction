The propagation logic can be a bit [fragile](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/7685) so I think we should work on a better fix.\n\nOne idea could be to change the abstraction we have to match document from a single Lucene query to something that could perform several Lucene queries. For instance in the case of `has_child`, we could have a first query that would collect parent ids and then build a new query based on these ids. This is the same execution logic, but each query on its own would solely depend on data that is stored in the current segment, so they would be cacheable (even though it might not a good idea to cache them).\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
