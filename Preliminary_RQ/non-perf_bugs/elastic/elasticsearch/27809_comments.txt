We also don't thing that splitting an index/shard while it's accepting requests is what our system should do. We wanted to have a way to cleanly roll-back and that is basically copy on write in a very fast way. Today if you use the shards splitting feature it will be almost instant and no data-copying is required. It's absolutely safe with regards to data-loss and that is our main priority. \r\n\r\n> index is bigger than 1 node can keep (say you have 50 shards * 50GB)\r\n\r\nFor shard splitting you don't need to relocate it will work out of the box without moving any shards.\r\n\r\n> only 1/some shards can be splitted\r\n\r\nI don't think this will add much value since our assumption is that indices are balanced. if you need to distribute hotspots use a [routing partitioned index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-routing-field.html#routing-index-partition)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/354653568","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27809#issuecomment-354653568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27809","id":354653568,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDY1MzU2OA==","user":{"login":"ddorian","id":1592898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTI4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1592898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian","html_url":"https://github.com/ddorian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddorian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-01T13:32:30Z","updated_at":"2018-01-01T13:32:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@s1monw I understand that it's a little troublesome to do it but ALL other systems do that: bigtable/hbase/cockroachdb, cassandra/scylladb, solr/vespa.ai . \r\n\r\nAlso, the problem with routing partitioned index is that it does that for all `routing` values (even small tenants).
