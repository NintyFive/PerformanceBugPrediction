That would actually cause us to put less burden on customer clusters.  Given how simple the change is I think it's worthwhile.  It's not great that someone who messes about with the file data visualizer and imports 10 small files ends up with 50 extra shards in their cluster in 6.x.  From 7.0 onwards the default is 1 anyway so the change would just be cosmetic.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
