This can be achieved by `copy_to` mapping option\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"_doc\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"name_ru\": { \"type\": \"keyword\", \"copy_to\": \"name_i18n\" },\r\n        \"name_kk\": { \"type\": \"keyword\", \"copy_to\": \"name_i18n\" },\r\n        \"name_en\": { \"type\": \"keyword\", \"copy_to\": \"name_i18n\" },\r\n        \"name_i18n\": { \"type\": \"text\" }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I cant know all the possible fields ahead, I just have a convention. So I need this mapping to be dynamic and I need to extract the `name` part from `name_ru` to use it for `copy_to` . I think this feature can be designed in the following way \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"_doc\": {\r\n      \"dynamic_templates\": [{\r\n        \"i18n\": {\r\n          \"match\": \"*_i18n\",\r\n          \"mapping\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"text\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }, {\r\n        \"rukken\": {\r\n          \"match\": \".*_(ru|kk|en)$\",\r\n          \"match_pattern\": \"regex\",\r\n          \"mapping\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"keyword\",\r\n            \"copy_to\": \"{name/(.*)_(?:ru|kk|en)$}_i18n\" // here it is\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggest to implement regex-based placeholder like `{name/REGEX}`. Regex should execute against field name, and placeholder should resolve to first captured group. Now I have to use elasticsearch fork with hardcoded {name-3} placeholder which just trims last 3 chars from field name","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
