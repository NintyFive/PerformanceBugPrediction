The multiple logging lines is caused by `DiskThresholdDecider` not being bound as a singleton. Usually this wouldn't cause any side effects for Elasticsearch, however, Marvel injects the DTD into its `NodesStatsCollecter` with a `Provider<...>`, which was creating a new instance of `DiskThresholdDecider` every time it collected the stats. The additional instances were then logging, which is why the logging increased in number every time it ran.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
