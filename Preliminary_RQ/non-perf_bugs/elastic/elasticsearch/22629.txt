Instead, for some queries, Elasticsearch is (incorrectly) giving scores of zero.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Execute the following curl commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST \"http://localhost:9200/test/test\" -d'\r\n{\r\n  \"description\": \"banana\",\r\n  \"date\": \"2016-01-01\"\r\n}'\r\n\r\ncurl -XGET \"http://localhost:9200/test/test/_search\" -d'\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"function_score\": {\r\n      \"boost_mode\": \"replace\",\r\n      \"score_mode\": \"max\",\r\n      \"query\": {\r\n        \"bool\": {\r\n          \"filter\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"range\": {\r\n                \"date\": {\r\n                  \"gte\": \"2016-01-01\"\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"functions\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"weight\": 3,\r\n          \"filter\": {\r\n            \"match\": {\r\n              \"description\": \"banana\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n 2. Note how the score is 0 when it should be 3.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"took\": 2,\r\n  \"timed_out\": false,\r\n  \"_shards\": {\r\n    \"total\": 5,\r\n    \"successful\": 5,\r\n    \"failed\": 0\r\n  },\r\n  \"hits\": {\r\n    \"total\": 1,\r\n    \"max_score\": 0,\r\n    \"hits\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"_index\": \"test\",\r\n        \"_type\": \"test\",\r\n        \"_id\": \"AVmhFx-cux_TRkqjzbdy\",\r\n        \"_score\": 0,\r\n        \"_source\": {\r\n          \"description\": \"banana\",\r\n          \"date\": \"2016-01-01\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\nN/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
