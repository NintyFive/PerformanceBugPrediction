If so, you will need to move it to a location within the elasticsearch configuration directory for 2.0.0-beta1 and newer. This is necessary since we use a security manager to limit the directories that the elasticsearch process can read from and write to.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/146391413","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13966#issuecomment-146391413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13966","id":146391413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjM5MTQxMw==","user":{"login":"robertsmarty","id":4920375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjAzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4920375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty","html_url":"https://github.com/robertsmarty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-08T01:53:27Z","updated_at":"2015-10-08T01:53:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the answer!

I understand ES's limitations in accessing files outside its config directory, but do we also have to live with this constraint in a production deployment scenario?
