Here is why, there are 2 reasons to do a release on a high level:\n- bug fixes\n- new features (new APIs added to ES that we have to support)\n\nWith the time based releases we release bugfixes frequently so users of the http client can get bugfixes through that. If there is a new API that needs to be supported ES need to be release anyways so things should be consistent and just come together.\n\nNow to the practical aspects:\n- having a different version number is confusing we have to explain which version we support in both directions.\n- using the same version as anything else in the stack (other clients taken aside - they should move too) has the advantage that it's clear what our supported version is on the upper end. \n- the location of the client is irrelevant for BWC\n- the location of the client is extremely relevant in development and should therefor be inside the ES project. if it's not in side we need to code against snapshots again and all the trouble starts from the beginning. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
