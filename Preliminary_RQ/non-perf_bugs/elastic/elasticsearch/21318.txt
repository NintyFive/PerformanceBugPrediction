The index type is N. I put a document with _id X under alias A. The bug is I can access X under B. Specifically,\r\n. GET /A/N/X gives me the document (expected)\r\n. GET /M/N/X returns \"Found False\" (not sure if correct)\r\n. GET /B/N/X gives me the document (unexpected)\r\n\r\nIn another test, I use the search api and the results are:\r\n. GET /A/N/_search?q=id:X gives me the document (expected)\r\n. GET /M/N/_search?q=id:X gives me the document (not sure if correct)\r\n. GET /B/N/_search?q=id:X finds no document (expected)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Build an index M and create two alias A and B\r\n 2. Put Document with _id X under A\r\n 3.
