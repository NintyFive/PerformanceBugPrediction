But for debugging purposes we might want to see it even when there isn't a checkpoint in progress. If we move it to the top level then as an end user I'm back to wondering which of `task_state` and `indexer_state` I should be taking notice of, and why there are two states in the first place. A better alternative is to have just one top level state that combines the two, like anomaly detection jobs and datafeeds have.  It can be defined as:\r\n\r\n* `failed` if what's currently reported as `task_state` is `failed`\r\n* `stopped` if there is no persistent task\r\n* Otherwise what's currently reported as `indexer_state`\r\n\r\nTo avoid multiple breaking changes to the stats format in consecutive versions and complex BWC this change should be made for 7.4.","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
