example config in elasticsearch.yml is:\n\n`#discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [\"host1\", \"host2:port\"]`\n\nUsing environment variables, I would assume to replace everything in square brackets:\n`export ES_HOSTS=\"[host1, host2:port]\"\ndiscovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: $ES_HOSTS`\n\nThis does not parse correctly though.  The only way I could get it to work was omit the brackets:\n`export ES_HOSTS=\"host1, host2:port\"\ndiscovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: $ES_HOSTS`\n\nGiven that this is not documented, not obvious, and also parses fine as:\n`#discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: \"host1\", \"host2:port\"`\n\nI propose we change the default config file.  There is also no other use of square brackets in the config file.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lockewritesdocs","id":25848033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODQ4MDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/25848033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs","html_url":"https://github.com/lockewritesdocs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lockewritesdocs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
