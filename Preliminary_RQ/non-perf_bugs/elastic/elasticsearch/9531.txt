Specifying the `target_buckets` would automatically calculate an interval `interval` that cleanly dividing the specified bounds into **about** as many buckets as requested.\n\n---\n\nHere is an example request that would ideally return 52 weekly buckets. Note that a \"clean\" interval (`1w`) is chosen over an interval that would have provided exactly 50 buckets.\n\n``` js\n{\n  \"x-axis\": {\n    \"date_histogram\": {\n      \"field\": \"@timestamp\",\n      \"bounds\": {\n        \"min\": 1388534400000, // 2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\n        \"max\": 1420070399999, // 2014-12-31T23:59:59.999Z\n        \"target_buckets\": 50\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
