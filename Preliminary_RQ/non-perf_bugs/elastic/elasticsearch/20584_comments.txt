When any index is created, it will match this template and will pick up the refresh interval.\n\n> Also, according to your [website], 2.4 is supported till 2018-02-28, so shouldn't this bug be fixed?\n\nThis does not mean that we fix every bug. The 2.x series has entered the stability phase of its lifecycle. Fixing the leniency in settings was a massive effort, backporting it from an actively developed line in 5.x to a stable line in 2.4 is just not going to happen.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
