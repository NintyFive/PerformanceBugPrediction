The user may well want more than one auto-generated field, so we shouldn't restrict this ability to just a single field.\n\n## Add auto-generated timestamps to ordinary date fields\n\nWe could allow the `null_value` for date fields to use date maths, eg:\n\n```\n\"last_modified\": {\n  \"type\": \"date\",\n  \"format\": \"YYYY-MM-dd\",\n  \"null_value\": \"now\"\n}\n```\n\nOr alternatively, even accept date maths directly in the `_source`:\n\n```\nPUT my_index/my_type/1\n{\n  \"title\": \"My title\",\n  \"last_modified\": \"now\"\n}\n```\n\nThe generated timestamp needs to be indexed and stored somewhere.  Two options:\n1. Update the `_source` field itself, replacing the `null` or date maths with the resolved timestamp\n2. Leave the `_source` as it is, and store the resolved timestamp in doc values or as a stored field.\n\nThe advantage of the first approach is that you automatically retrieve the resolved value without having to request any specific fields.  However, this is the only place where we would change the original `_source` field before storing it.  Is this a problem?\n\n@kimchy thoughts on altering `_source`?\n\nMy preference would be altering the `_source`, but the doc values or stored fields approach would work as well.\n\n## Replace `_ttl` with `_expiration`\n\nWhile we could support the `_ttl` field and mapping for bwc, the new meta field should be `_expiration`, and its mapping would look like this:\n\n```\n  \"_expiration\": {\n    \"enabled\":        true,\n    \"required\":       true,            # optional\n    \"default\":        \"10m\",           # optional\n    \"format\":         \"dateTime\",      # optional\n    \"timestamp_path\": \"last_modified\"  # optional\n  }\n```\n\nThe `_expiration` parameter can be passed as:\n- an absolute value, eg `1425671241123`, or `2014-01-01 23:15:16` (interpreted by `format`)\n- date math, eg `now+10m`\n- relative times, eg `10m`, in which case it is added to the value in the `timestamp_path`, if specified, otherwise to `now`\n- if not specified, then the `default` value will be used or, if no default is set (or `_expiration` is manually specified as `0`) then the document will not expire.\n\n## Moving to plugin\n\nThe expiration of documents based on TTL feels sufficiently removed from the core that I think this functionality should be moved to a plugin.  This would also allow the addition of increased checks (eg not returning expired documents in a search request, as happens today) without impacting performance for the vast majority of users who don't use the expiry functionality.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/77626856","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9679#issuecomment-77626856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9679","id":77626856,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NjI2ODU2","user":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-06T20:10:24Z","updated_at":"2015-03-06T20:11:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Related
