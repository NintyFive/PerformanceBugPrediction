The packaging tests [do test upgrading from the previous major version](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/6671c0cf09ffe9dbc31936b25524df88d29612ed/qa/vagrant/src/test/resources/packaging/scripts/80_upgrade.bats).

2.3.3.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/227814784","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19026#issuecomment-227814784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19026","id":227814784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzgxNDc4NA==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-22T17:19:26Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T17:19:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I
