Most of the code has been moved to es core. There are a few classes though where we try not to depend on es, under `o.e.ingest.core` , which one day we might want to take out and make a separate library. The main processors are also part of core. grok processor is a module, while geoip stays as a plugin for now. Nothing to do here at this point, closing.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
