Also because the packaging seems to explicitly work with armhf builds of openJDK for quite a while: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/6356ad2228c47ade41f2f717f60f22363a987211\nThe only lacking bit is to adjust the deb repository to make the packages discoverable. Preferably for any architecture, if not possible then at least armhf (but be prepared for someone asking about MIPS or powerPC down the road). Sadly I can't help with that detail as I am not that well familiar with Debian repositories and their metadata.\n\nPS: Should you at any point be interested to do testing on ARM, then looking at http://scaleway.com might be worth it, as they have implemented a \"cloud\" interface for reasonably powerful, native ARMv7 server hardware. That's where I noticed the issue.\nPPS: On a tangent, you may want to explicitly state on your website that anything else than x86/AMD64 is not officially supported, because the page that @markwalkom pointed to, saying it would state so, does in fact nowhere state that. I went and searched the whole website and couldn't find any mention of it, actually. Partly understandable as, aside from architecture specific JRE bugs, it should just work anywhere.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/92051540","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10551#issuecomment-92051540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10551","id":92051540,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyMDUxNTQw","user":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-12T12:41:56Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T12:41:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"From the lucene side, I don't think ARM is possible to support, its not open source or in openjdk, as opposed to other platforms. \n\nAarch64 is different, its open source, etc. But personally i won't spend one iota of time on oracle \"commercial\" platforms, I don't know about anyone else.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/92055951","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10551#issuecomment-92055951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10551","id":92055951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyMDU1OTUx","user":{"login":"dm8tbr","id":2073288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzMyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2073288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dm8tbr","html_url":"https://github.com/dm8tbr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dm8tbr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dm8tbr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dm8tbr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dm8tbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dm8tbr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dm8tbr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dm8tbr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dm8tbr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dm8tbr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-12T12:53:28Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T12:55:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rmuir I'm not sure I follow you.

We have added unified apt repositories for all elastic software, per major version, and also started using aptly to build the repository. Unfortunately, it looks like [aptly also has issues with noarch packages](https://github.com/smira/aptly/issues/585). Additionally, there is already a workaround (installing .deb file directly) as mentioned above. While we may support arm directly in the future, keeping this issue open indefinitely only adds noise to the enormous backlog of open issues in the elasticsearch repo.
