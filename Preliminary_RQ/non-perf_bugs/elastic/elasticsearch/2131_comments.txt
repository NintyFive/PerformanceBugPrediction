Merely wanted to point out where the builder pattern could be enforced. Please feel free to close and ignore!\n\nMy original use case was reading in the elasticsearch.yml file on the client side in order to utilize the custom analyzers. Remove would have allowed me to remove anything not pertinent to analysis (! index.analysis). In the end I used injectors+modules instead of created an embedded node, so I should no longer have issues with other values set in my elasticsearch.yml file.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
