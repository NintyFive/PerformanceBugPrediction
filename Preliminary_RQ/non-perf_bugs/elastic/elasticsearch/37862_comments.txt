I'm going to close though since it's being tracked in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27377, and in particular there's a plan that was discussed here: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27377#issuecomment-347238853\r\n\r\nThe tl;dr: is that we would like to start passing the raw value to the script, but also pass in the `doc_count`.  Both are important to provide, so that the user knows if the value is actually `null`, or if it's just `null` because there were no documents.\r\n\r\nThanks for opening the issue, and sorry you're running into this :(  There are several related pipeline issues that revolve around missing docs / null values, so hopefully we can start tackling them soon.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
