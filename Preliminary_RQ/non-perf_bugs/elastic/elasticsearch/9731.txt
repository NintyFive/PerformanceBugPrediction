This is caused by the following code in ElasticsearchMergePolicy: \n\n```\nstatic class IndexUpgraderMergeSpecification extends MergeSpecification {\n\n        @Override\n        public void add(OneMerge merge) {\n            super.add(new IndexUpgraderOneMerge(merge.segments));\n        }\n\n        ...\n\n}\n```\n\nI'm assuming this was done because the current merge policies are only responsible for determining when a merge should a occur, not how it should affect the output.  Has anyone given any consideration to modifying IndexUpgraderOneMerge to delegate some of it's responsibility to the calling OneMerge?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
