Therefore elasticsearch only listens on localhost (127.0.0.1:9200). Now we had the intention to build a cluster by adding another host. For cluster communication, elasticsearch should bind to another IP (e.g. 192.168.20.13). Our configuration looks like this:\n\n```\nnetwork.bind_host: 127.0.0.1\nnetwork.publish_host: 192.168.20.13\n```\n\nThe expected behavoior: Elasticsearch binds 127.0.0.1:9200 and 192.168.20.13:9300 (this one for cluster communication).\nThe actual behavior: Elasticsearch binds 127.0.0.1:9200 and 127.0.0.1:9300.\n\nCheers,\nMarco\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/92070245","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10015#issuecomment-92070245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10015","id":92070245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyMDcwMjQ1","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-12T14:23:03Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T14:23:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @misterunknown \n\nYou appear to be confusing publish/bind with transport/http.  Transport is for intra-node communication, which defaults to using port 9300.
