My Reasoning being in ideal world all fields should be defined  and set correctly but when processing new logs the dynamic feature can be useful.\r\n\r\nSo what I'm proposing would be when a dynamic mapping is created it gets a flag such as \"auto_created\":\r\n```\r\n \"filename\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"text\",\r\n            \"flag\": \"auto_created\",  <------\r\n            \"fields\" : {\r\n              \"keyword\" : {\r\n                \"type\" : \"keyword\",\r\n                \"ignore_above\" : 256\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way when someone is reviewing mappings you can quickly check for the flag and review and tweak the auto created mappings.  Then simple remove the flag or even set a different one perhaps depending on workflow.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
