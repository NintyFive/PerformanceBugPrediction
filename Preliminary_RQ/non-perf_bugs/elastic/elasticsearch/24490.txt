After updating the dependency to the transport client (5.3.2 => 5.4.0) suddenly the project failed to build. Reason was, that some *transitive* dependencies of Elasticsearch were missing (e.g. Lucene itsself, various others).\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is #23809: Previously all the transitive dependencies in ES were excluded \"one by one\" in the POM file (see exclusions on each dependency): http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/5.3.2/elasticsearch-5.3.2.pom\r\n\r\nIn 5.4.0 it now has a `*:*` exclusion instead: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/5.4.0/elasticsearch-5.4.0.pom\r\n\r\nThis seems to work with Maven (I built a plugin that uses Maven to refer to Elasticsearch and its transitive deps), but Apache Ivy/Ant breaks horribly. It seems that a bug in Ivy (2.3.0 and 2.4.0) causes that the `*` matches not only the transitives of elasticsearch, but also the declared dependency itsself. This causes that Ivy ignores all dependencies in Elasticsearch that are marked with this `*:*` exclusison pattern.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure this is a bug in Ivy, but I don't think that gets fixed in time (Ant's Ivy project is almost dead...?).\r\n\r\nAs Gradle also uses Ivy internally, are we sure this works with Gradle?","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
