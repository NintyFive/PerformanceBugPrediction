And whether the REST client should implement the same `Client` interface or not. Also this proposal makes me think about #9201 which is about changing the java api too, but if we are going to have a REST client, seems like these changes are relevant only if we need things internally.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/159220879","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14961#issuecomment-159220879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14961","id":159220879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTIyMDg3OQ==","user":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-24T10:22:47Z","updated_at":"2015-11-24T10:22:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@javanna Thanks for the pointer to the other issue, I wasn't aware of that.
