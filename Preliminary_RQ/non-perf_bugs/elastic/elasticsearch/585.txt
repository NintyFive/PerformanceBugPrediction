Using the simple highlighter in lucene, even fields without the mapping can be highlighted (and not required to be stored as well, since the content is automatically extracted from source if needed).\n\nNote, this is a slower highlighting process, with bigger memory requirements during highlighting. The benefit of using it is the fact that the index size can be smaller.\n\nAlso, only a single `pre_tag` and `post_tag` are supported.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
