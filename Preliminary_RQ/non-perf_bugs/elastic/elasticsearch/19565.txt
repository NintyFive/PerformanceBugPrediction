The reasoning is similarly opposite: to help to find _missing_ data.\n\nThe simplest example is when using another data store, you often want to turn around and verify that you have all of the data (consistency check). Looking for _missing_ data is hard otherwise because you need to use a bucket selector, which means you need to use a script.\n\n``` http\nGET /test/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"find_missing_ids\": {\n      \"histogram\": {\n        \"field\": \"numeric_id\",\n        \"interval\": 1,\n        \"min_doc_count\": 0\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"max_bucket_selector\": {\n          \"bucket_selector\": {\n            \"buckets_path\": {\n              \"count\": \"_count\"\n            },\n            \"script\": {\n              \"inline\": \"count == 0\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis does mean that there is a workaround to the feature, but it's much more verbose than `\"max_doc_count\": 0` and inherently slower. Note: `\"min_doc_count\": 0` was included just to be explicit -- that is currently the default.\n","closed_by":{"login":"pickypg","id":1501235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1501235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg","html_url":"https://github.com/pickypg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
