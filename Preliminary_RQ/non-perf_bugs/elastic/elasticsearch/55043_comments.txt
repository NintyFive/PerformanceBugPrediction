I think the behaviour is expected. Note that in your example you are expecting an error for the whole bulk request if some or all of the operations fail, but that's not how the bulk API works. Please note that if you send a \"_bulk\" request via REST api with one document that should succeed (has no unknown fields that would cause the \"strict\" setting to error) and another that should fail like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /index/_bulk\r\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"index\", \"_id\" : \"1\" } }\r\n{ \"id\" : \"1\", \"name\" :  \"name1-s1\"}\r\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"index\", \"_id\" : \"2\" } }\r\n{ \"id\" : \"2\", \"name\" :  \"name1-s5\", \"summaryHtml\" : \"the-summary2-s5\", \"categoryId\" : 10004}\r\n```\r\nthe response contains the top-level `error` property set to `true` to indicate that there have been errors in some bulk actions and the failed action contains a 400 status code and an error message. \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"took\" : 27,\r\n  \"errors\" : true,\r\n  \"items\" : [\r\n    {\r\n      \"index\" : {\r\n        \"_index\" : \"index\",\r\n        \"_type\" : \"_doc\",\r\n        \"_id\" : \"1\",\r\n        \"_version\" : 2,\r\n        \"result\" : \"updated\",\r\n        \"_shards\" : {\r\n          \"total\" : 2,\r\n          \"successful\" : 1,\r\n          \"failed\" : 0\r\n        },\r\n        \"_seq_no\" : 1,\r\n        \"_primary_term\" : 1,\r\n        \"status\" : 200\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"index\" : {\r\n        \"_index\" : \"index\",\r\n        \"_type\" : \"_doc\",\r\n        \"_id\" : \"2\",\r\n        \"status\" : 400,\r\n        \"error\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"strict_dynamic_mapping_exception\",\r\n          \"reason\" : \"mapping set to strict, dynamic introduction of [summaryHtml] within [_doc] is not allowed\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that with the Java client you can check those properties with `BulkResponse#hasFailures()`, `BulkResponse#getItems()` and `BulkItemResponse#getFailureMessage()\" respectively. Let me know if this solves your needs.\r\n\r\nI will check our documentation if we have examples for this in the REST Api docs and the High Level Client docs because I can imagine this being a more frequent ask, maybe we should add a few lines and/or an example to the
