This looks like a general question (if auto-translate was correct) and is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead. There is a section in the forum where you can also ask your questions in Chinese: https://discuss.elastic.co/c/in-your-native-tongue/chinese","performed_via_github_app":null}]
