The [JLine fix](https://github.com/jline/jline3/commit/864f2063255b6f1bedce1605ae4ff76d5f22b55c) indicates that an octal decoding of a term's capability tripped the issue, so it's likely setup dependent (and maybe why this hasn't surfaced earlier). It might help if you could attach an `infocmp` output from the terminal that fails the SQL CLI. Thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
