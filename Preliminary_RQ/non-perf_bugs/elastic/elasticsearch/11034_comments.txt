There hasn't been a new release since 1.6.4 which happened a few years ago... .\n\nIt has been very handy to use. Single API call to get the status on 100 node cluster. Many monitoring tools (bigdesk, ElasticHQ, ...) for ES rely on it (since its part of the API), and the ones I have found handy are basic ones, just with an opportunity to see the state across the cluster easily. I've mainly used cpu (os and process), swap usage, and in extreme cases network and fs statistics.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/99940537","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11034#issuecomment-99940537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11034","id":99940537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5OTQwNTM3","user":{"login":"lukas-vlcek","id":205174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/205174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek","html_url":"https://github.com/lukas-vlcek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukas-vlcek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-07T17:07:55Z","updated_at":"2015-05-07T17:07:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Do I understand this correctly that you are considering dropping REST APIs (cluster, admin...) that expose info based on Sigar lib?
