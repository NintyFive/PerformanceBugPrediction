Painless works inline as is, and it is very useful for ad_hoc querying. It is stupid to store a groovy query for a quick question and unsafe to allow it to run inline.\n\nIt is valid to need a quick answer from a `_source` field that is not indexed because it is usually not needed at query time for an app but that sometimes you need to check.\n\nWhy don't let the user worry about the consequences? In a SQL database you can easily blow it by issuing a simple `SELECT`, but you can issue it anyways.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
