was suggested by @jpountz in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/10571#issuecomment-92499177.\n\nOff the back of #10571 it would be easier if the ValueFormat in aggregations was always non-null so that in the cases where null would currently be returned from the `ValuesSourceParser` it instead returns `ValueFormat.RAW`. This would mean that instead of checking for null AND `ValueFormat.RAW` we could instead just check for `ValueFormat.RAW` in the places where we only output on a specialised format and we can just blindly call the `ValueFormat` for cases where we don't care if the format is specialised or raw.\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
