There are not so many concurrent requests usually but occasionally a query could exceed the RAM available and `OutOfMemoryError` occurs. I've never seen the ES node being able to recover from such tragic state, until I do a manual restart. I have to do so once or twice per month.\n\nIs this the behavior by design? When an OutOfMemoryError occurs, ES will enter a undefined state and not be able to recover?\n\nHere is a typical log: http://pastebin.com/3KdP81EC\nHere is my `/_nodes` result: http://pastebin.com/kmPzw5KY\n\nNote, it is a single node ES setup so no split-brain issues..\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
