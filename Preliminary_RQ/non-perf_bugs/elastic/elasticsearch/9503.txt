However,  this introduces a race condition in the case that the target shard has moved to POST_RECOVERY and the master processes the shard started action and activates the shard before the source node completes the recovery. In that case the source node will close the source shard, causing the recovery to be cancelled. The target node receives the cancellation notification and deletes the local copy (still in POST_RECOVERY).\n\nThe extra close listener is not yet released but is part of the 1.5 push.\n\nSee: http://build-us-00.elasticsearch.org/job/es_core_1x_debian/3474/\n","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
