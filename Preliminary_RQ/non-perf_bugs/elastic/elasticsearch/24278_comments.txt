There are also similar benefits with the query cache, as well as more consistent scoring if you make sure that a given user always goes to the same shard copies. I'm not totally sold on using the hash of the request as a default preference as I can imagine it would not be desirable all the time, however I'm +1 on better documenting `preference` and how it can help with the request cache.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/383871316","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24278#issuecomment-383871316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24278","id":383871316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Mzg3MTMxNg==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-24T09:45:44Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T09:45:44Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-search-aggs","performed_via_github_app":null}]
