This is it now:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * helper to get a random value in a certain range that's different from the input\r\n     */\r\n    public static <T> T randomValueOtherThan(T input, Supplier<T> randomSupplier) {\r\n        if (input != null) {\r\n            return randomValueOtherThanMany(input::equals, randomSupplier);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return(randomSupplier.get());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if you pass in `null` it'll just run the supplier one time. I think this is confusing - if you pass in null it shouldn't return null. I think something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * helper to get a random value in a certain range that's different from the input\r\n     */\r\n    public static <T> T randomValueOtherThan(T input, Supplier<T> randomSupplier) {\r\n        return randomValueOtherThanMany(v -> Object.equals(input, v), randomSupplier);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be better.
