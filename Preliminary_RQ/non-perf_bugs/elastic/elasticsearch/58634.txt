It is desirable to be able to disable hash function, provided _routing param is a valid integer.\r\n### My use case\r\nWe have ~1 million documents, half of which are visible to all the users, and the other half only searchable by admin users. Since we have a lot more end-users than admin users, it is not efficient to put all the documents in the same shard, which is a waste of CPU for search operations. So the documents should be somehow separated for end users, so that they search only within ~500k documents while occasional admin searches being done in both partitions.\r\nI have 2 implementation options for this use-case:\r\n1. Use _routing parameter: the problem with this approach is that I don't know how to set _routing parameter to be sure that the documents are really stored in 2 different shards. So there is always a chance of having 1 shard on 1 million documents while the other shard is empty.\r\n2. Store documents in 2 different indices: the problem with this approach is that this change is not as transparent to my client code as option 1. I have to make more changes to my queries, and make sure to delete document from 1 index and insert it into the other when the public visibility of document is changed; the details which have already been handled by Elasticsearch if _routing was possible without hash function.\r\n\r\nSo any chance to a configuration in future releases to have a custom hash function / disable it for routing? Or maybe I must stick to option 2 or other alternative?","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
