Stored fields support multi-valued fields but don't have an object structure like json so that is why they look the way they do. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/59193720","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7992#issuecomment-59193720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7992","id":59193720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTkzNzIw","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-15T11:48:29Z","updated_at":"2014-10-15T11:48:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nik9000 has summed it up correctly.
