This bug was introduced in a patch release 7.0.1 which is meant to be a painless upgrade and affected multiple people as seen in the links I've provided.\r\n\r\nIf a patch release introduces a severe bug, it would be expected that the next patch release after the bug is fixed would included the fix. But in the pull request for the fix https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/41938 it seems like ElasticSearch isn't interested in that.\r\n\r\nThey don't want to offer the fix in 7.0.2 which would be the reasonable thing to do. Not even 7.1.0 (which is far too late anyway), but in 7.2.0! @jimczi claims \"It's too late for 7.1.0\". What does \"too late\" even mean? I commented in that issue but nobody has responded.\r\n\r\n> Why is this not being put into the very next patch release? The very point of a patch release is to fix bugs.\r\n> \r\n> Including this severe bug that has made search completely unusable for us. This bug was introduced in a patch release and has no good reason not to be fixed in a patch release.\r\n> \r\n> What was supposed to be a painless upgrade to 7.0.1 has literally broken search for us and we are supposed to wait for 2 more minor releases?\r\n> \r\n> Forget 7.2.0 and even 7.1.0, this needs to be a priority to make it into 7.0.2!\r\n\r\nWhat is the ElasticSearch policy on when a patch release completely breaks something? If this ridiculous stance is supported by the whole company and fixes to a severe bug **that are already fixed** won't be included as soon as available we will be rethinking what role this product has in our future.","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
