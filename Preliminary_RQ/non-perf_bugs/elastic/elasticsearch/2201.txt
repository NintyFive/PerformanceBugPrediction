The idea is to provide a low latency UDP service that allows to easily index data that is not of critical nature.\n\nThe Bulk UDP service is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `bulk.udp.enabled` to `true`.\n\nThe bulk UDP service performs intenral bulk aggregation of the data and then flushes it based on several parametres:\n- `bulk.udp.bulk_actions`: The number of actions to flush a bulk after, defaults to `1000`.\n- `bulk.udp.bulk_size`: The size of the current bulk request to flush the request once exceeded, defaults to `5mb`.\n- `bulk.udp.flush_interval`: An interval after which the current request is flushed, regarldess of the above limits. Defaults to `5s`.\n- `bulk.udp.concurrent_requests`: The number on max in flight bulk requests allowed. Defaults to `4`.\n\nThe network settings allowed are:\n- `bulk.udp.host`: The host to bind to, defualts to `network.host` which defaults to any.\n- `bulk.udp.port`: The port to use, defaults to `9700-9800`.\n- `bulk.udp.receive_buffer_size`: The receive buffer size, defaults to `10mb`.\n\nHere is an example of how it can be used:\n\n```\n> cat bulk.txt\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"test\", \"_type\" : \"type1\" } }\n{ \"field1\" : \"value1\" }\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"test\", \"_type\" : \"type1\" } }\n{ \"field1\" : \"value1\" }\n\n> cat bulk.txt | nc -w 0 -u localhost 9700\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
