You can just move the search hits of the response into a bulk request on the client side exactly like `reindex` would do. The issue with the `bulk` format is that it wouldn't reflect all the informations that are present in a search response (number of hits, aggregations, highlighting, ...). You can also use the snapshot/restore functionality to export an index from one cluster to another. If a full snapshot is too big to transfer from one cluster to another you can also use a [`source-only`]( https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.4/modules-snapshots.html#_source_only_repository) snapshot and then reindex the `_source` in the remote cluster like any local index. For these reasons we don't think that adding a `bulk` format would be really helpful since we have enough alternatives to export data with a few lines of client code.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/452449133","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36980#issuecomment-452449133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36980","id":452449133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjQ0OTEzMw==","user":{"login":"fbaligand","id":3750300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTAzMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3750300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand","html_url":"https://github.com/fbaligand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbaligand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-08T20:59:01Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T20:59:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sad to hear this :(","performed_via_github_app":null}]
