Everybody is implementing it by hand, with hard to maintain and error-prone jobs or with extra hits to the cluster.\n\nSo it would be nice if it was implemented out of the box. It may be implemented as the well known rolling strategies of the logging frameworks. Something like this:\n- Enabled in the index settings (available for using it in templates)\n- The index name is just the base part of the final name\n- A formatted date(time) is appended to the base name\n- A date format could be specified but a default one is used otherwise\n- A rolling period could be specified (30m, 6h, 2d). With default to 1d\n- Every time a new index is rolled an alias to the base name is created\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
