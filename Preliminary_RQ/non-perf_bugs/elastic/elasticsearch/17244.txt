If you set `chunk_size` to `200mb`, then Snapshot service will call S3 repository to snapshot 3 files with the following sizes:\n- `200mb`\n- `200mb`\n- `100mb`\n\nIf you set `buffer_size` to `100mb` (AWS maximum size recommendation), the first file of `200mb` will be uploaded on S3 using the multipart feature in 2 chunks and the workflow is basically the following:\n- create the multipart request and get back an `id` from AWS S3 platform\n- upload part1: `100mb`\n- upload part2: `100mb`\n- \"commit\" the full upload using the `id`.\n\nWe should definitely check that the `buffer_size` setting is always lower than `chunk_size`. Otherwise, setting this value is useless.\n\nMay be we should also change the default values for `chunk_size` and `buffer_size` in the context of S3 plugin and define respectively them to `5tb` and `100mb`?\n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
