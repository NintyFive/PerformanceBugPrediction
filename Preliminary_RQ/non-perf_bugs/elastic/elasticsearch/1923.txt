Sometimes while I am updating an index my connection will get confused and then I can no longer connect to my ES instance. I then have to restart the instance to get it working again. I've been looking in the logs and also set the level to `DEBUG` but I don't see any evidence as to what's causing it. Any suggestions?\n\nI am using the `tire` ruby gem to interact with ES. So this is the output I'm experiencing during my import\n\n```\n[IMPORT] Starting import for the 'Post' class\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1219/1219 | 100% [ERROR] Connection refused - connect(2), retrying (1)...#######\n[ERROR] Connection refused - connect(2), retrying (2)...\n[ERROR] Connection refused - connect(2), retrying (3)...\n[ERROR] Connection refused - connect(2), retrying (4)...\n[ERROR] Connection refused - connect(2), retrying (5)...\n[ERROR] Too many exceptions occured, giving up.
