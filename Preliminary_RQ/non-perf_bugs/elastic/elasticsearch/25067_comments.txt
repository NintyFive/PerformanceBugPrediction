I've researched this a bit more. I think think the problem is actually that ES was hitting the memory limit set by docker.\r\n\r\nThe suggested setup (which I used at first without thinking) was\r\n```yaml\r\n      - bootstrap.memory_lock=true\r\n      - \"ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m\"\r\n    ulimits:\r\n      memlock:\r\n        soft: -1\r\n        hard: -1\r\n    mem_limit: 1g\r\n```\r\nIn other works \"the container gets 1g, the max java heap size is 512mb\". But I think the ES container might sometimes need more than 512mb of extra RAM.\r\n\r\nFor example I now have\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    - \"ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms7g -Xmx7g\"\r\n    ulimits:\r\n      nproc: 3000\r\n      nofile: 65536\r\n      memlock: -1\r\n    mem_limit: 8g\r\n```\r\n\r\nand docker stats shows\r\n```\r\nCPU %        MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %    NET I/O             BLOCK I/O    PIDS\r\n1.35%        7.493GiB / 8GiB       93.66%   4.63kB / 3.52kB     0B / 659kB   90\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words in this case the container is using `0.493GiB` more memory than the `ES_JAVA_OPTS`
