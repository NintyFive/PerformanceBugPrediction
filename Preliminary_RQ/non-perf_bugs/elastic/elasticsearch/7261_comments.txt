In this particular case I'm concerned about filter aggregations. If there's a way that it could be rolled into some other work that would be ideal. I don't see why the 'not_*' dynamic aggregation I described above couldn't be replaced with 'other', though that issue (https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/6804) looks to have been closed.
