A power loss on multiple machines at the same time holding all the copies of the data will suffer though from the periodic behavior.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/99776154","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9151#issuecomment-99776154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9151","id":99776154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5Nzc2MTU0","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-07T08:44:57Z","updated_at":"2015-05-07T08:44:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed via https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/11011\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
