We try not to make breaking changes in minor releases. There have been times we have done it deliberately to address serious bugs. That aside, it’s not clear what happened here, but we are more sensitive to breaking changes these days (as evidenced by enabling rolling upgrades between major releases). We will not be reintroducing this parameter in 5.x, the 5.x series is in maintenance mode only where we focus on stability and fixing critical bugs.
