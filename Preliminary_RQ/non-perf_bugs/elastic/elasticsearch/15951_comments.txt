That is much more complicated than what we have today (and I especially don't like that the lookup of a field for search becomes linear on the object level of the field).\n\nI am still convinced that doing `dots-as-path` is the correct choice. There are really two sides to users pain here, the first is dynamic mappings, and the second is explicit mappings. In the first case, I believe we can implement it within the document parsing that we have (which is where dynamic mappings are determined), and can be done independently of the second case (which I believe is harder, but still doable).\n\nAs for your concerns about `_source`, my thoughts are as follows:\n1. Source filtering should be viewed as a regex on the full path of a field, so I think returning the source as-is for all fields with a full path that match the regex is correct (so it should return your first example).\n2. Update requests should work as they do today, which I believe merges the new document with the previous version. Therefore your \"version 3\" should be what happens. I do also think that we shouldn't be so concerned with returning a normalized view, but that can/should be explored in a separate issue.\n\n@jpountz has expressed a concern with this approach and the edge cases it brings, in particular with nested fields. I think in the case, for example, where `foo` is already a nested field, we will need to reject `foo.bar` as a field, since it should require that `foo` is an object field. But I think that is completely doable and testable.\n\nWhile discussing with @jpountz he also made me realize escaping might be simpler than I originally thought. However, I still think this `dots-as-path` approach is correct for a couple reasons:\n1. It works with existing 1.x indexes for upgrade.\n2. It does not complicate the api, or have possible confusion for users who pass in `foo.bar` in there document, but then later find they must query with `foo\\.bar`.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/172845167","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15951#issuecomment-172845167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15951","id":172845167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Mjg0NTE2Nw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T12:57:13Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T12:57:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> As for your concerns about _source, my thoughts are as follows:\n\nAgreed on both counts.  \n\n> But I think that is completely doable and testable.\n\nGood to hear.
