Your question is better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. In this case you are trying to put documents with differing types into the same index, which isn't supported any more since 6.x, see https://www.elastic.co/de/blog/removal-of-mapping-types-elasticsearch). I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead where somebody surely can dig into your specific programming question more deeply. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
