behavior**:\r\n\r\nEven in 5.4, the docs on [Query String Query > Boolean operators](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#_boolean_operators) still state that\r\n\r\n> `NOT` takes precedence over `AND`, which takes precedence over `OR`.\r\n\r\nwhich in the absence of explicit parens is demonstrably not the case. Comments on #9414 and #13100 (both linking to [this article](https://lucidworks.com/2011/12/28/why-not-and-or-and-not/)) make it clear that Lucene does not work that way and that this is highly unlikely to change.\r\n\r\nSuggest replacing the text \r\n\r\n> However, the effects of these operators can be more complicated than is obvious at first glance. NOT takes precedence over AND, which takes precedence over OR. While the + and - only affect the term to the right of the operator, AND and OR can affect the terms to the left and right.\r\n\r\nwith something along the lines of\r\n\r\n> However, due to Lucene quirks, these operators behave unpredictably when mixed unless precedence is explicitly forced using matched parentheses. This includes e.g. mixtures of implicit (`\"default_operator\":\"AND\"`) and explicit (`\"query\":\"foo OR bar\"`) operators.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT mrec\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"doc\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"s\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"string\",\r\n          \"analyzer\": \"standard\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nPUT mrec/doc/1\r\n{\r\n  \"s\":\"apple\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nPUT mrec/doc/2\r\n{\r\n  \"s\":\"banana split\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nGET mrec/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"query_string\": {\r\n      \"query\": \"s:(apple OR banana AND split)\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the documentation I expected both docs to match, i.e. that the query would be treated like `s:(apple OR (banana AND split))`. It's actually interpreted as `+(s:apple s:banana) +s:split`, i.e. only the `banana split` doc matches.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
