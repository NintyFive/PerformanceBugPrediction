In the meantime, you don't need to manage \"a bunch\" of versions, just two, 2.13 and whatever other version you are on.

Currently the readme says: \n\n> You’ll need to have a modern version of Gradle installed – 2.13 should do.\n\nWhich makes it sound like 2.13 or upwards is fine. \n\nThere's no mention of version on the contribution doc.\n\nIt's only a small issue and the error message makes it very clear what has gone wrong, but it could save the time of people like me, as I just downloaded the latest version of Gradle purely for the sake of contributing to the project.\n\nI'd be happy to make the change myself since I was after something simple first anyway. Is it precisely version 2.13 that works, or can slightly older Gradle versions work too? \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/251173332","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18935#issuecomment-251173332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18935","id":251173332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTE3MzMzMg==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-03T17:41:57Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T17:41:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@manterfield Please do make a PR!
