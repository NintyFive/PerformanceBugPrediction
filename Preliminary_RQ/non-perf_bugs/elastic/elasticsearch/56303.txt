It seems we have yet to encounter a scenario in the past where we have had 2 simultaneous staged releases. Right now both 7.7 and 7.8 are staged for release. Our build logic is not designed to copy with this scenario and as such has started to fail. In the mean time we have made some changes to `7.x` and `master` to make the build happy again. Primarily, we have hacked the `master` build to effectively _ignore_ the 7.7 branch entirely for the purposes of BWC.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to ensure we fix the following after the 7.7 release:\r\n\r\n1. Remove 7.7 from `BwcVersions.IGNORED_VERSIONS`\r\n2. Un-mute `VersionUtilTests.testGradleVersionsMatchVersionUtils`\r\n3. Regenerate BWC test versions via `updateCIBwcVersions` for `7.x` and `master` (should be done after release anyway)","closed_by":{"login":"mark-vieira","id":4106672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4106672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-vieira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
