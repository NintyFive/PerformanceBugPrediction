Currently, it seems to be not possible to use the 'size' filter in filtered aliases. The \"limit\" filter isn't suitable, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21444623/elasticsearch-limit-filter-ambiguity for the difference.\n\nAdrien mentioned (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/elasticsearch/86A5DbEP94E) that this would be also an interesting feature given that while Elasticsearch is fast at retrieving the top hits, going deeper in the result set can use lots of resources (both CPU-wise and memory-wise).\n\n=> Please implement the \"size\" parameter for filtered aliases.\n=> Are there any workarounds for this problem.\n\nThank you, BTW: ES is really great!\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
