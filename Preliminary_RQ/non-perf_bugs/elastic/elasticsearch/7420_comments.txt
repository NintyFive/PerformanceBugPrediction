You should be able to do so writing a plugin and calling the  `IndexQueryParserModule#addQueryParser` method (https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/IndexQueryParserModule.java#L126)\n\nA good example of how to write a plugin can be found here: https://github.com/imotov/elasticsearch-native-script-example . It adds a custom script to the ScriptModule module. You should do an equivalent thing with IndexQueryParserModule\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
