However, that's not really a useable workaround for me because I simplified this example from an application case where I don't have direct control over the JSON serialization.\r\n\r\nI saw issue #32395 (a related issue about BigIntegers) and @mayya-sharipova 's comments there, but I'm not sure if the commits for that issue also fix this one since that one is about source filtering.\r\n\r\nI saw issue #26364 and the comments from @jdconrad / @nik9000 there . I'm not sure if this is duplicate or a closely related issue. It seems that the solution there was to write the application in Java with the Transport Client that will write the JSON so the value looks like a double, but I don't think that is a possible solution for everyone and think that there is an actual bug here in that the above query using curl does not work.","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
