This limit is controlled by [the `search.max_buckets` setting](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-settings.html).\r\n\r\nIf you want more assistance, there's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. If you believe that there is a bug in Kibana that is causing it to make aggregations which trigger this limit when they shouldn't, please [file an issue in the Kibana repo](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/new/choose). For now, I'm going to close this issue as this does not appear to be an Elasticsearch bug.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
