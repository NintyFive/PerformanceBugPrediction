We should include the order in which nodes should be upgraded (for example: do we suggest ingest-only nodes first, master nodes last?), especially for larger deployments.\r\n\r\nFor overall Elastic Stack upgrades, I've opened [`elastic/stack-docs#537`](https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/issues/537) for best practices to be included.","closed_by":{"login":"inqueue","id":6099128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTkxMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6099128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inqueue","html_url":"https://github.com/inqueue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inqueue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inqueue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inqueue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inqueue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inqueue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inqueue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inqueue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inqueue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inqueue/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
