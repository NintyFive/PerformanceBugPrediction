So the cause of this is because it's reading `CONF_DIR` at line 59 as noted) from bash script. I think we have two options:\n- Have the integration tests fail if they detect the configuration files\n- Change the script to allow the conf dir to effectively be ignored.\n\nI don't really want to change the script to have some sort of test flag, but failing the tests seems almost aggressive. However, I think failing the tests is the only way to effectively warn you that your system is setup in a way that may change the tests, thereby making them unreproduceable.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/384129216","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29708#issuecomment-384129216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29708","id":384129216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDEyOTIxNg==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-10T17:28:56Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T01:14:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"*Original comment by @brwe:*\n\nCould user script not optionally accept a parameter that points to the config directory?
