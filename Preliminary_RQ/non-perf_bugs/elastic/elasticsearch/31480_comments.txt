You can more easily affect this behaviour using the usual indices options like `ignore_unavailable` and `allow_no_indices`, remote and local indices are treated the same by the search API. Default behaviour is strict though, meaning if one of the indices is not found, a hard error will be returned.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
