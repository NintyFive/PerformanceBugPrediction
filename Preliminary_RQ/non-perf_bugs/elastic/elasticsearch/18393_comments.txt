If you start only a single node, ES does not assign this shard as it wants to prevent allocating a stale shard copy. It therefore requires a quorum (2 copies) of the data to be available before deciding which one is the most recent one. This can be influenced by the setting `index.recovery.initial_shards` (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/index-modules.html#dynamic-index-settings ). Setting this to \"1\" will start recovery if only one copy is available but is dangerous as it can make a stale shard copy primary, leading to data loss.\n\nNote: we have improved this in v5.0.0 with allocation ids #14739, so that we don't need a quorum of copies anymore to ensure allocating a non-stale copy.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/219682879","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18393#issuecomment-219682879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18393","id":219682879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTY4Mjg3OQ==","user":{"login":"vineet01","id":13980705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTgwNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13980705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineet01","html_url":"https://github.com/vineet01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineet01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineet01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineet01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineet01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineet01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineet01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineet01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineet01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vineet01/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T10:46:23Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T11:46:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://discuss.elastic.co/t/50211\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
