In our work, we consider that a system is in trouble if more than 50% of its files become orphan (i.e., without a main author).\n\nMore details on our work in this preprint: https://peerj.com/preprints/1233\n\nWe calculated the TF for **Elasticsearch** and obtained a value of **2**.\n\nThe developers responsible for this TF are:\n\nShay Banon (kimchy) - author of 51% of the files\nSimon Willnauer - author of 20% of the files\n\nTo validate our results, we would like to ask **Elasticsearch** developers the following three brief questions:\n\n(a) Do you agree that the listed developers are the main developers of **Elasticsearch**?\n\n(b) Do you agree that **Elasticsearch** will be in trouble if the listed developers leave the project (e.g., if they win in the lottery, to be less morbid)?\n\n(c) Does **Elasticsearch** have some characteristics that would attenuate the loss of the listed developers (e.g., detailed documentation)?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGuilherme Avelino\nPhD Student\nApplied Software Engineering Group (ASERG)\nUFMG, Brazil\nhttp://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
