The purpose of the `min_doc_count` option is to make it configurable. For example, if\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"aggs\" : {\n        \"tags\" : {\n            \"terms\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"tag\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nreturns\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    ...\n\n    \"aggregations\" : {\n        \"tags\" : {\n            \"buckets\" : [\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"search\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 115\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"java\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 50\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"concurrency\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 12\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nthen\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"aggs\" : {\n        \"tags\" : {\n            \"terms\" : {\n                \"field\" : \"tag\",\n                \"min_doc_count\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nwould return\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    ...\n\n    \"aggregations\" : {\n        \"tags\" : {\n            \"buckets\" : [\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"search\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 115\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"java\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 50\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe special case `min_doc_count: 0` will behave similarly to the [`all_terms` option of facets](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-facets-terms-facet.html#_all_terms) and also return terms that don't match any hit. For example, we could have the following response:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    ...\n\n    \"aggregations\" : {\n        \"tags\" : {\n            \"buckets\" : [\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"search\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 115\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"java\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 50\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"concurrency\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 12\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"unit testing\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 0\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"performance\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 0\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHistograms are going to support this option as well and the [`empty_bucket` option](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/search-aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html) will be removed in favor of `min_doc_count: 0`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
