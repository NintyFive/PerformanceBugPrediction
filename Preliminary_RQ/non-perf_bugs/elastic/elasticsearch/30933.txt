While `tests.rest.blacklist` *works* it is suboptimal because the \"normal\" place to look for a skipped tests is in the test source code rather than in the `build.gradle` file. So I'd like to add `skip: distribution` style support. It'd look like this:\r\n```\r\n    - skip:\r\n        distribution: zip\r\n        reason: xpack creates some templates that make this test not pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'd like this sooner rather than later because we're starting to reuse the yml tests for distributions. It'd also be super nice to have this for #30665.","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
