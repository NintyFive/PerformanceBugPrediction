the introduction of `authorization_realm` (and existing `run_as`) functionality, it would be helpful to be able to configure a realm to perform lookup only, but not authenticate.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/33262#issuecomment-417395628\r\n\r\nThe proposed design is to add a `authentication.enabled` flag in the config (default `true`), which would be readby `RealmConfig`, and then when authenticating, the `AuthenticationService` would skip any realms for which the config's `isAuthenticationEnabled` method returned `false`.\r\n
