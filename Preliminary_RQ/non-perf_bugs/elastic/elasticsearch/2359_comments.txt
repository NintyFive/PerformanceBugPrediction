You can simply call the string method always, to get the string values. You can optimize if you want in case you have bytes, but it doesn't look like you do it. So just call string() on each fragment, without checking, it will automatically convert the bytes to string if needed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/9790024","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2359#issuecomment-9790024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2359","id":9790024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3OTAwMjQ=","user":{"login":"Omega359","id":226258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/226258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Omega359","html_url":"https://github.com/Omega359","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Omega359/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Omega359/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Omega359/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Omega359/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Omega359/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Omega359/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Omega359/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Omega359/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Omega359/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-10-25T19:09:32Z","updated_at":"2012-10-25T19:09:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sure, that's what I've done. It's just that having a 'hasString' method implies according to normal coding conventions that you can call that to test prior to calling to retrieve the string :) Simple enough to work around but it can (and obviously did in my case) introduce some confusion.
