What do you mean with continuing the operation? I would think, if the NPE happens, you will not get back data, right?\n\nYour second exception makes me think: How stable is your network (as a network problem might also have been an issue for the first case)? The second exception tries to connect to an elasticsearch node but fails. Is that node not reachable?\n\nHow do initiate the transport client? Do you connect to one single node or do you specify all the nodes in the cluster (there is also a feature called sniffing, where it is sufficient to connect to one node and the transport client then automatically finds out the other nodes in a cluster and uses all of them).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/37531130","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5401#issuecomment-37531130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5401","id":37531130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTMxMTMw","user":{"login":"roblangenfeld","id":1999493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTk0OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1999493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblangenfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/roblangenfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblangenfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblangenfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblangenfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblangenfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblangenfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblangenfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblangenfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblangenfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblangenfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-13T13:16:58Z","updated_at":"2014-03-13T13:16:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The initial error in the bug report happens on the side of the TransportClient (I see it getting logged out on the eclipse console). \n\nTo clarify my statement where I said it recovers, that is actually incorrect.
