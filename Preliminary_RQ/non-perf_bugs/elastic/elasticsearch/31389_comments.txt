But I also understand why someone would like to add a second-level of protection, I am fine either way. I know Lucene uses `exorcise` but I think we could find a better name / workflow. For instance I think some other tools are interactive whenever changes need to be applied and ask to confirm, maybe this is something we can get inspiration from. In any case I'm open to how we want to handle that part. The main things that I care about are having a name that makes the data loss obvious (`remove-corrupted-segments` sounds great) and having as few options as possible (ie. skip options that don't help much in the context of Elasticsearch like cross-checking term vectors).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/411705312","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31389#issuecomment-411705312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31389","id":411705312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTcwNTMxMg==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-09T10:00:21Z","updated_at":"2018-08-09T10:00:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We've had a good discussion around this tool and have concluded the following:\r\n\r\n1) We should have one tool for dealing with corruptions, both in the translog and in the lucene index\r\n1) The tool will refuse to run if there are no existing corruption markers (i.e., it will only work on known corrupted shards)\r\n1) The tool will first run a dry run and show an analysis of what it's going to do to the user, get confirmation and then perform required operations.\r\n1) The tool should fail when check index fails to drop corrupted segments in Lucene. In the future we can offer users to only recover the translog, if needed. We don't feel we need the complexity right now.\r\n1) We should document the implication of the tool to join relationships as it may be unexpected to users.\r\n1) The tool should generate a new history uuid to prevent ops based recoveries and CCR.\r\n1) The tool should generate a new allocation id and tell the user what command they need to run in order for the cluster to use this shard (allocate stale primary).\r\n\r\nWe have run out of time and didn't discuss the parameters and tool naming. @vladimirdolzhenko can you post a suggestion here based on the above and we can discuss it further?\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/417641044","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31389#issuecomment-417641044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31389","id":417641044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzY0MTA0NA==","user":{"login":"vladimirdolzhenko","id":209440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTQ0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/209440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirdolzhenko","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirdolzhenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirdolzhenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirdolzhenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirdolzhenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirdolzhenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirdolzhenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirdolzhenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirdolzhenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirdolzhenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirdolzhenko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-31T11:52:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T11:52:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- tool is `elasticsearch-shard` with a subcommand `remove-corrupted-data` \r\n- actually there is no corrupted markers for a translog (PR is following) - therefore tool performs analysis first for it - if it is clean (not corrupted) is the same as no corruption marker, check for corruption marker for index files\r\n- tool has `--index-name` and `--shard-id` parameters or `--dir` for the cases of multiple nodes per data dir / environment \r\n- as tool performs analysis before any destructive actions (those have to be confirmed) it is decided to drop `--dry-run` option","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/451934900","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31389#issuecomment-451934900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31389","id":451934900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTkzNDkwMA==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-07T13:29:31Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T13:29:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed by #32281.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
