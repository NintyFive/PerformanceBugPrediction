And it allows to use it when it is **really** necessary.\n\nAs one more solution, it is move geo-shape functionality to the separate library like a plugin.\n","closed_by":{"login":"yurkom","id":1897602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTc2MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1897602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurkom","html_url":"https://github.com/yurkom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurkom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurkom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurkom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurkom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurkom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurkom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurkom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurkom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurkom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
