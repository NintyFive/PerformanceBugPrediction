It works just fine for most cases, except for during testing where I use an embedded node, which throws the above exception.\r\n\r\nI realize that embedded node is [\"not supported\"](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-the-server), but it is just too useful for automated testing to give it up without a fight.\r\n\r\nSo this difficulty lives at the crossroads of 2 debatable decisions: abandoning slf4j and refusing to support embedded nodes even for testing. And these decisions have been debated, e.g. #19415, #21011, #22671.\r\n\r\n@ctron 's cluge mentioned in #19415 seems to be the best solution available at the moment. Perhaps we should reconsider using slf4j, or come up with a better solution. This does seem to be a common use case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
