Followed the installation instructions, but when I try to load Marvel, I get:\n\n```\nMarvel: Error 400 Bad Request: Cannot read property 'cluster_name' of undefined\n```\n\nCalling `/api/marvel/v1/clusters` returns the same:\n\n```\n{\n  statusCode: 400,\n  error: \"Bad Request\",\n  message: \"Cannot read property 'cluster_name' of undefined\"\n}\n```\n\n`cluster.name` is defined in `elasticsearch.yml` and shows (as `cluster_name`) with a `curl localhost:9200`.\n\nSo I'm not quite sure what's going on. The Marvel agent is definitely running, and I have the Marvel indices created (I already tried deleting them and recreating them):\n\n```\n.marvel-es-2016.03.16\n.marvel-es-2016.03.17\n.marvel-es-data\n```\n\nI also tried  stopping all the nodes and restarting them. Ideas?\n\nThanks!\n\nPS: I also filed this [in the forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/marvel-refusing-to-load-cannot-read-property-cluster-name-of-undefined/44640) but got no response. I'm not sure whether this is an actual bug or some mistake on my part. Either way, any help debugging the issue will be welcome.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
