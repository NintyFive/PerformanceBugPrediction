Very simple scenario - \nES Cluster: 3 master nodes (A2), 3 data nodes (A6) and 3 query nodes (A2)\nNo. of indices: ~1400\nData (primary): ~300 GB\n\nState of cluster when the observation happened: Very low rate of query ~0.2/sec, indexing rate ~250 docs/sec and all of these touching only 1 of ~1400 indexes\n\nWhat happened? There were in total ~500 create index call happened (retry 3 times on failure), on an average ~ 8 -10 per minute, heap grew from 25% to 75% in 10 minutes and came back to 25% (pattern continued). A lot of timeout exceptions seen.\n\nNetwork I/O was 7 MBps that time in master.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
