I assumed being able to use `version_type=force` and script something like `if(ctx._version==NUMBER){ DO_SOMETHING;}`.\n\nSadly that does not work and sadly i cannot even find any kind of documentation as to what I can expect to find in the script context. Looking through examples i did find out there is at least `ctx._source` and `ctx.op` other than that i cannot find anything in the documentation.\n\nCan anybody shed some light on this ?\n","closed_by":{"login":"matthiasg","id":231889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTg4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/231889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasg","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
