Sometime during the 1.4.0/1.4.1 upgrades, we started to notice the exact same phenomenon on 2-node cluster (when node 0 would shut-down, node 1 became unresponsive for 30-60 seconds). We are using unicast discovery where hosts specifies the private IP of both nodes. I'm curious if you think explicitly setting network.bind_host to the private IP of the node will resolve this and if so why?\n\nRegards,\nN.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
