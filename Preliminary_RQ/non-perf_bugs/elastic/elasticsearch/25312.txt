Today, we create fields for all sub-fields, but we could greatly reduce the number of required fields if we make object fields queryable.\r\n\r\nWe would need a specialiased analyzer which can accept JSON and transform an object like:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"status\": \"active\",\r\n        \"age\": 25,\r\n        \"city\": \"New York\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\ninto the following terms:\r\n\r\n    \"status:active\", \"age:25\", \"city:new\", \"city:york\"\r\n\r\nThen you could search for `active` statuses with:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"match\": {\r\n        \"my_object\": \"status:active\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"query_string\": {\r\n        \"query\": \"my_object:\\\"status:active\\\"\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe could possibly even support searching for \"New York\" vs \"New City of York\" with:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"match_phrase\": {\r\n        \"my_object\": \"New York\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nwhich would be rewritten as `my_object:\"city:new city:york\"`\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to be able to aggregate on the `age`  field, the object field could be mapped as:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"my_object\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"object\",\r\n        \"index\": true,\r\n        \"dynamic\": false,\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"age\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"integer\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWith this mapping, only the `my_object.age` sub-field would have its own Lucene field (or Elasticsearch field) and the rest of the object would be queryable via the `my_object` field.\r\n\r\nThis could even be made to work on the whole document by allowing the `_source` field to be configurable.","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
