Well, I found this out when trying to fix #8959.  I fiddled with https://gist.github.com/nik9000/24c596b33aae44d04a5b to reencode this on the fly but haven't really tried testing it yet.\n\nIf you think this is worth fixing and https://gist.github.com/nik9000/24c596b33aae44d04a5b is a good start I'd be happy to do the testing too if someone will point me in the right direction.  Is the right way to test this with the REST tests or something funky with the Java tests?\n\nTechnically this would be a breaking change too, but I think the current behavior is a bit silly.  I suppose it might allow you to put raw binary blobs in the payload but I'm not sure that'd work properly.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/67311658","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8975#issuecomment-67311658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8975","id":67311658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MzExNjU4","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-17T11:48:13Z","updated_at":"2014-12-17T11:48:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nik9000 what you say makes sense.
