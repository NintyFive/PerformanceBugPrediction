If there is no id value specified in the IndexRequest, an id is auto-generated. If that auto id differs from the _id value in the document an error occurs. \n\nAllow for a mapping setting to \"search\" for the id (something like id path, similar in nature to routing path).\n\nThe only reason it makes sense to have this option is because ES is parsing the bytes to a JSON-equivalent structure to check the _id value of the document. There is little sense to do this in the client if ES is already doing it. \n\nThe `path` element can be set on the `_id` mapping, allowing to set a path for it (similar to routing), if no id is provided, and path is set, the path will be used to extract the id from the source. This does require another (quick) round of parsing the source document.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
