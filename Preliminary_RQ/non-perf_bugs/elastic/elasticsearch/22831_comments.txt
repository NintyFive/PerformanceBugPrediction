Sadly that was a typo on my end when I made the issue. `%{UKNOWN:field}` gives exactly the same behavior. \r\n\r\nre `%{\\d+:field}` -  I expected `%{.*}` to always be matched and it's content analyzed. In that sense I expected grok patterns to be a templating strings for regular expressions. Reading the logstash docs, I see it is not and people can used named matches (or custom patterns) for things not in our list. That said, I think my issue about named patterns still holds.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/276480363","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22831#issuecomment-276480363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22831","id":276480363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjQ4MDM2Mw==","user":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T20:21:38Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T20:21:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bleskes makes sense, I'll make it do a better job during parsing","performed_via_github_app":null}]
