This is my query:\n\n```\n{ \n  \"query\": {\n    \"function_score\": {\n      \"query\": {\n        \"multi_match\": {\n          \"query\":    \"bla^2.5 blubb\",\n          \"type\": \"most_fields\",\n          \"fields\": [ \"title^2.5\", \"preview_text^1.3\" ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe \"bla\" keyword should be boosted by the factor 2.5. I found out that boosting via caret works as expected if it is a whole number (^2, ^3, ^4), or if it is less than 1 (^0.2, ^0.5). But when using ^2.5, elasticsearch (or lucene) seems to convert the search query to \"bla 2.5 blubb\", seeming not to recognize the caret boosting, removing the caret and introducing 2.5 as a new keyword.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
