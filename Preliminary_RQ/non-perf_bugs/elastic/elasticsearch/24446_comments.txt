That is why these methods are reflectively loaded this way, they are methods on Sun interfaces only (`com.sun.management.UnixOperatingSystemMXBean` and `com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean`).\r\n\r\n> Using the above code should work on all JVM implementations.\r\n\r\nAs an important point of clarification, we only support certain OpenJDK distributions (as packaged by OS distributions such as Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS, etc. for x64) and Oracle distributions for Linux x64, macOS, and certain Windows OS.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
