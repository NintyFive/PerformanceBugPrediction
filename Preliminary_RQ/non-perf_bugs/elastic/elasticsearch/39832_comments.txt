We return exceptions to clients, so you can just analyze the results from your requests:\r\ne.g.:\r\n```js\r\n        \"error\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"mapper_parsing_exception\",\r\n          \"reason\": \"failed to parse field [my_long] of type [long]\",\r\n          \"caused_by\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n            \"reason\": \"For input string: \\\"wrong_input\\\"\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nIs there any exception that doesn't get returned to a client, but you can see in the logs?\r\n\r\nSecondly, elasticsearch configuration has `log4j2.properties` file that allows you to configure log level per class. For example, you can set up `debug` level to bulk indexing like below, while setting log level for all other actions to `info`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nlogger.shard_bulk.name = org.elasticsearch.action.bulk.TransportShardBulkAction\r\nlogger.shard_bulk.level = debug\r\n```\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/472932176","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39832#issuecomment-472932176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39832","id":472932176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjkzMjE3Ng==","user":{"login":"dr0i","id":944023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NDAyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/944023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i","html_url":"https://github.com/dr0i","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0i/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-14T15:55:10Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T15:55:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mayya-sharipova Thx for this input - configuring log level per class sounds like the solution for my issue!
