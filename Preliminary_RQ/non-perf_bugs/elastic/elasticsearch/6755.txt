E.g. `com.google.common.base.Preconditions` can also be found at `org.elasticsearch.common.base.Preconditions` This leads to folks on my team often accidentally importing the wrong class and a frustrating experience including elasticsearch in our project.\n\nThese can be hidden from IDE auto-import. [Google Guice has done the same thing](https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/Guice40), so it would be a great example to look at:\n\n> Many things inside com.google.inject.internal changed and/or moved. This is especially true for repackaged Guava (formerly Google Collections), cglib, and asm classes. All these classes are now hidden from IDE auto-import suggestions and are in new locations. You will have to update your code if you relied on any of these classes. \n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
