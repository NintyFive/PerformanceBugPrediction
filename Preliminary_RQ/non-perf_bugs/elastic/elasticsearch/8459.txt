But we are having problems while indexing. \n\nSay we have an index - \"test1\" with  the following mapping:   \n\n```\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"visit\": {\n      \"dynamic\": \"strict\",\n      \"_all\": {\n        \"enabled\": false\n      },\n      \"_routing\": {\n        \"required\": true,\n        \"path\": \"visitor.id\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"visitor.id\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can see here that we use custom routing (using the \"visitor.id\" field). An insert of the type:\n\n```\n{\n\"visitor.id\" : abc\n}\n```\n\n would work in version 1.0.0 but fails in version 1.3.4 with the following exception (because of the dot notation in the field name):\n\"MapperParsingException[The provided routing value [abc] doesn't match the routing key stored in the document: [null]]\",\n\nThere wasn't a standard regarding field names and an attempt has been made here: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/6736\n\nBut the routing check while indexing is causing problems for us. Is there any solution without having to reindex?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
