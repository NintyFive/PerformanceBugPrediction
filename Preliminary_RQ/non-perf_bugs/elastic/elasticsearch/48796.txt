The nodes were being run with `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=536870912` despite a 6GB heap. It turned out the heap size was being set twice:\r\n\r\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/elastic/original/3X/e/9/e9b1506dd907e88ca36668f96ca6f0dfa6351f42.png)\r\n\r\n`-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=536870912` would be consistent with `JvmErgonomics` incorrectly picking up that the heap is `1GB` rather than `6GB`. I don't have a way to reproduce this to investigate further but this feels like a bug somewhere along the way.","closed_by":{"login":"williamrandolph","id":3253644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTM2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3253644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph","html_url":"https://github.com/williamrandolph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williamrandolph/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
