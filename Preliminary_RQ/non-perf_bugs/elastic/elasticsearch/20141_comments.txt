Unfortunately, this is the way it works at the moment.  The problem is that random scoring uses the `_uid` field, which currently doesn't have doc values (see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11887).  That means that you have to load the UID into fielddata (on the heap) which, considering the number of docs you have, is going to be costly.\n\nSorry I can't give you a better answer at the moment.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
