Rather use the `match` query for these cases.\n\nThat said, you can escape individual special chars with `\\`, eg:\n\n```\nPUT test\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"text\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"analyzer\": \"whitespace\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT test/test/1\n{\n  \"text\": \"This AND~ that\"\n}\n\nGET _search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n      \"default_field\": \"text\",\n      \"query\": \"AND\\\\~\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
