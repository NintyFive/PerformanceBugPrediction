Hence, if two different weights are conflated into a single score, then alphabetical sorting takes over which is often not what you want.\n\nThe correct behavior is to use the assigned weight _as is_.\n\nNote that a workaround seems to be to manually space out weights values by some constant, e.g. 1000.\n","closed_by":{"login":"malthe","id":26405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe","html_url":"https://github.com/malthe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
