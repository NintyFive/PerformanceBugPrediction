Isn't there a built-in system that prevents such failures. I agree that we should be monitoring the hard space and not let this happen in first place, but some times things happen.\n\nMy setup is a single node at present. Using ES 2.1.0, which was supposed to have this fix.\n\nI don't see a clear way to recover the node. A post at https://t37.net/how-to-fix-your-elasticsearch-cluster-stuck-in-initializing-shards-mode.html seemed to help, but still few indices got corrupted and I have no way to recovering them.\n\nAt the end, I ended up deleted the indices, but that's not the way it should be. Such things must be taken care of ultimately. But this is clearly a bug with ES 2.1.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
