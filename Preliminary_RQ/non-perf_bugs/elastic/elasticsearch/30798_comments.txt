Instead, we feel that the right approach is have monitoring in place alongside Elasticsearch to monitor system-level stats, and Elasticsearch stats endpoints should provide application-level metrics which can be collected externally. For us, we have [metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/metricbeat) in our stack to ship system-level statistics, and today we have monitoring in X-Pack to collect the application-level statistics from Elasticsearch.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
