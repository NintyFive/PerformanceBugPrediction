We're unlikely to actually force a snapshot of an index from ILM, because snapshots span multiple indices and ILM policies are per-index. If we allowed ILM policies to spawn their own snapshots, a cluster with 1000 indices would end up creating 1000 snapshots. Rather, an ILM step should wait until the delete phase has started, then wait for a snapshot to be taken naturally (via SLM) prior to the delete.\r\n\r\nClosing this for now since it's a duplicate, we can re-open if more discussion is needed (or discuss on #45067)","performed_via_github_app":null}]
