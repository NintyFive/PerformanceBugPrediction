When the API key is not cached, the PBKDF2 10,000 (default) hashing is required and it takes a long time to finish (~70 ms). This leads to saturation of the GET thread pool when a large number of clients try to connect for the first time. \r\n\r\nWhen the pool is saturated by a large number of new clients, it not only blocks the new clients but also blocks the existing clients. This is because all clients require fetching their API key document through the GET thread pool. This leads to instability for all clients. It does _not_ feel right to block existing clients from indexing just because there are new clients trying to connect. A possible approach is to have a dedicated thread pool for secret hashing work. Ideally this pool should be shared for all hashing work, e.g. native realm etc. In practice, the first step would be creating it for ApiKeyService to offload the computation cost from the GET thread pool.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is the response status when the pool is saturated. It currently returns `401` because we do not want leak any information to unauthenticated clients. However, this also makes it impossible for a legitimate client to tell whether they should retry on failures. If the server is too busy to handle authentication, return something like `429` could be more appropriate. Since authentication is _not_ even attempted, this information (server is busy) is likely safe to share.
