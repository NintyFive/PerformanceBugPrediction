If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. The discussion forums are beter suited to these sorts of troubleshooting and problem diagnosis conversations.\r\n\r\nIn your forum post, please include:\r\n1. The exact version of the High Level Rest Client you are using. (I believe spring uses an old version of the client, but we need to know exactly what is in use in your project).\r\n2. The code for where you perform one of the operations that returns this warning (e.g. the put  index mapping request).\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the forums that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
