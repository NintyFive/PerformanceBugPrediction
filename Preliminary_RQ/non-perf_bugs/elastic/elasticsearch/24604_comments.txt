is the thing.\r\n\r\nI initially proposed to add a Java API docs QA module in our Gradle build so I would have been able to backport the project I have locally on my laptop which helped me to build the Java documentation until now. But this has been qualified as not useful because we have already a lot of Java tests around. So I'm still doing updates from time to time but manually.\r\nMy goal was to automatically import into the documentation the lines of code so we are never de-synchronized anymore. (https://github.com/elastic/docs/issues/4). Thanks to @nik9000 with #24354, we now have that import mechanism.\r\n\r\nI was adding to my backlog some of the missing APIs when people were asking for that in discuss. For example: #22235.\r\n\r\nBut then we started to build the REST Client and it was clear to me that because we are going to deprecate it anytime soon and remove it at some point, continuing to build that deprecated doc was a waste of time. That's the reason I started to contribute instead on the High Level Client doc as you can see in #23351.\r\n\r\nSo what I'd do **if and only if** we want to update the transport documentation:\r\n\r\n* Add a QA Java Transport Client documentation module (with all my existing code in it) or add integration tests for the [transport module](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/client/transport)\r\n* Move the current Java doc to use what Nik Built\r\n* Add a QA REST HL Client Java documentation module (or extract [from the tests of the HLClient](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/client/rest-high-level/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/client/CrudIT.java) module - which might be better). Would be awesome to be able to reuse the transport client part to make sure we can still migrate easily from one client to the other.\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/318668271","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24604#issuecomment-318668271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24604","id":318668271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODY2ODI3MQ==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T14:34:16Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T14:34:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am leaning towards closing this issue.
