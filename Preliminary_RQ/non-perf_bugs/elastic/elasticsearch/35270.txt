However when this is referred through its id and that id changes, the plan becomes inconsistent.\r\nFor example `SELECT COALESCE(null, 1) AS c FROM ... HAVING c > 100`\r\n\r\nThe optimizer will optimize the `Coalesce` definition but `HAVING c > 100` will still use the old script definition (now residing in the scalar reference).\r\nThis is a recurrent issue that affect all rules and proved to create bugs in the past due to old references lying around. In the above case it's even more problematic since the old id is not used (and thus the query does not blow up) but the old script is.","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
