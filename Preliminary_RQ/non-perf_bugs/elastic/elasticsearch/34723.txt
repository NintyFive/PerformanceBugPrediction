If you try setting this buffer to a size of around 300 MB the buffer size will overflow since it is stored as an int.  This should be a long so that a large buffer can be allocated.  If a request returns a large JSON document this can exceed the largest size that can be requested with an int.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bwf93","id":7559095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTkwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7559095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwf93","html_url":"https://github.com/bwf93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwf93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwf93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwf93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwf93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwf93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwf93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwf93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwf93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwf93/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
