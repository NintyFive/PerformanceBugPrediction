Here are the details -\n\nI have a cluster of 7 nodes, with 3 master eligible with no data and 4 only data nodes. I have set minimum master node property to 2. I have used KOPF/ElasticHQ/Head for monitoring. I have set up the cluster for testing so there is hardly any querying to going on. So it remains idle most of the time. After few hours of inactivity, the plugins cannot show the any details except for the green status (no other details like shard etc shown).  If I make any search query, it does not work. \n\ne.g. http://ironman:9200/_search?q=chrome\n\nI have to restart the master's elasticsearch service to make it responsive again. I checked the  $ tail -f /var/log/elasticsearch/avengers.log I don't see any failure/exceptions. I had elastic search 1.1 and updated to 1.2 as well. But I am still having this issue. \n\nPlease let me know if you need more details.\n\nThanks,\nNilesh.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
