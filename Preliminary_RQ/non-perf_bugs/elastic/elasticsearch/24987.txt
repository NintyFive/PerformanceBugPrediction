As a result, non-ascii parameters may appear in the resulting request.\r\n\r\nOne could expect the path to be encoded, because the query parameters, passed as a map, are encoded by RestClient. I'd expect the client to either handle all of the encoding, or none of it.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Call `client.performRequest(\"GET\", \"foo$bar\")\r\n 2. See how the produced request still includes the \"$\" character, instead of \"%24\".\r\n\r\n**Possible explanation of the issue**:\r\n\r\nThe reason why path is not encoded can be found in `RestClient#buildUri`\r\n\r\n```\r\n           // ...\r\n            URIBuilder uriBuilder = new URIBuilder(fullPath);\r\n            for (Map.Entry<String, String> param : params.entrySet()) {\r\n                uriBuilder.addParameter(param.getKey(), param.getValue());\r\n            }\r\n            return uriBuilder.build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe path is passed to the `URIBuilder` constructor, but the constructor expects a valid (encoded) String representation of an URI, not a non-encoded path.\r\nThis can be confirmed by diving deeper into the implementation: `URIBuilder(fullPath)` first calls `new URI(fullPath)`, which calls `parse(false)`, which sets the `path` attribute. Then the constructor calls `digestURI` with the resulting URI, which sets `encodedPath` (*!*) to `URI.getRawPath()`, which simply returns the value of the `path` attribute that was set earlier, which is not an encoded value...\r\n\r\nA simple solution would be to use the default constructor of `URIBuilder`, and just call `setPath(String)`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n           // ...\r\n            URIBuilder uriBuilder = new URIBuilder();\r\n            uriBuilder.setPath(fullPath);\r\n            for (Map.Entry<String, String> param : params.entrySet()) {\r\n                uriBuilder.addParameter(param.getKey(), param.getValue());\r\n            }\r\n            return uriBuilder.build();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
