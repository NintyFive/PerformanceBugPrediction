The WildcardQueryBuilder then calls [`MappedFieldType.extractTerm()`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/mapper/MappedFieldType.java#L446-L470) with this query and this method is not able to deal with queries that are not term based.\r\n\r\nJust out of curiosity, why are you wanting to do a wildcard query on the `_index` field instead of just using a wildcard expression for the indices in the URL for the search? e.g.\r\n```\r\nGET .kib*/_search\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/315340232","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25722#issuecomment-315340232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25722","id":315340232,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTM0MDIzMg==","user":{"login":"varunsharma27","id":18154526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTU0NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18154526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunsharma27","html_url":"https://github.com/varunsharma27","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunsharma27/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunsharma27/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunsharma27/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunsharma27/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunsharma27/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunsharma27/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunsharma27/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunsharma27/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varunsharma27/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-14T11:46:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T13:29:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@colings86 Actually i'm implementing a user role-based access to dashboards and data.
