According to the [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery-settings.html#modules-discovery-settings) the only supported value for `discovery.type` is `\"single-node\"`. You are enabling a hidden mode intended for some internal tests that you can only discover by reading the depths of the source code, but which certainly isn't supported.
