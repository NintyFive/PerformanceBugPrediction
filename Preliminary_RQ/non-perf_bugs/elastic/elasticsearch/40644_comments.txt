Regarding this statement:\r\n>Although it isn't really anything to do with replication, the [replication overview](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/docs-replication.html) is really more about the read and write models and I think that documenting the visibility semantics could fit here.\r\n\r\nAre you hoping to condense the concepts of the read/write model into the topic for near-real time search? Namely describing how ES uses a replication group for writes and a coordinator node for reads, both of which can impact the refresh? I just want to ensure that I understand your intention.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/639349976","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40644#issuecomment-639349976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40644","id":639349976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzOTM0OTk3Ng==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-05T08:53:03Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T08:53:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think a separate page is fine, no need to combine this with the replication overview.
