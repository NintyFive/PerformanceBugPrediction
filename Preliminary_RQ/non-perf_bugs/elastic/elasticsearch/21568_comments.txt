As updates are not hogging memory anymore, remaining issues due to the unbounded nature of the pending cluster tasks queue have manifested in the form of the master node becoming slow/unavailable/CPU-bound when running into a high number of pending tasks. Other open issues capture work that helps with avoiding/better handling a large number of tasks, so we can close this one.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
