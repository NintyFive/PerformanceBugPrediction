This is dangerous as users can set values which produces huge numbers of terms and at best bloat their index but at worst cause problems such as https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25841. \r\n\r\nI think we should add soft (and/or maybe hard) limits so that neither `min_size` or `max_size` can be more than say 6 and the difference between `min_size` and `max_size` can't be more than 2 or 3 (we may even want to make this limit 1). \r\n\r\nNote that this does not apply to `edge_ngrams` where it is useful to have higher values and a larger difference between min and max values. We should probably decide if there should be different limits here though.","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
