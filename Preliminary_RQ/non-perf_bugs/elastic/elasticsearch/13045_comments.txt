However I have some domain-specific words, for example `i/o` that I want to keep as one. So I have a mapping char_filter to do `'i/o => i_fs_o'` and then a `pattern_replace` filter to put it back again (`'pattern'     => '(.*)_fs_(.*)','replacement' => '$1/$2',`).  The problem is that I need to specify every case variate of i/o in the mapping ('I/o','I/O', etc). Since I have 50 or so such keywords, the variations of case bloat the mapping considerably.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/252418700","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13045#issuecomment-252418700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13045","id":252418700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjQxODcwMA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-08T11:06:24Z","updated_at":"2016-10-08T11:06:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tomfotherby Use the [pattern-replace character filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/analysis-pattern-replace-charfilter.html) instead\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
