You have to install all plugins that you need on the client and the server. The plugin might contain transport protocol classes that you need to serialize / deserialize things so you need it on both ends.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/256571150","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21090#issuecomment-256571150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21090","id":256571150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjU3MTE1MA==","user":{"login":"itonics-tbeauvais","id":9199882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxOTk4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9199882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itonics-tbeauvais","html_url":"https://github.com/itonics-tbeauvais","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itonics-tbeauvais/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itonics-tbeauvais/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itonics-tbeauvais/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itonics-tbeauvais/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itonics-tbeauvais/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itonics-tbeauvais/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itonics-tbeauvais/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itonics-tbeauvais/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itonics-tbeauvais/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T07:47:42Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T07:47:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!
