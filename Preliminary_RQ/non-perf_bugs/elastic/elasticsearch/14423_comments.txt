It night also be broken by the move to\ngradle, as that was just a few days ago and we had a bazillion things to\nmake work and certainly missed a few, like run.sh.\n\nUntaring the distribution is the most real thing you can do. In prod you\nare more likely to use the deb or rpm but they don't differ much from the\ntar save for startup and permissions things.\nOn Nov 1, 2015 2:39 PM, \"Andrej Kazakov\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> According to\n> https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/TESTING.asciidoc it\n> can be done by running run.sh http://../blob/master/run.sh or run.bat\n> http://../blob/master/run.bat, but those guys use mvn.\n> \n> I see there's been a push to move from maven: #13930\n> https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13930.
