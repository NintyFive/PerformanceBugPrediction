Then I added second-level fields of the same name on each of those nested fields. Then I tried a nested query against each of the paths, and found that only the first-defined path succeeded\n\n**Expected:** Performing a nested query when a document has multiple nested fields with the same second-level field names succeeds\n\n**Actual:** I only get hits for matches on the nested field that was defined first.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Create an index and document type with nested field mappings. Add a document which adds a field of the same name to each nested field.\n\n```\nPUT /test_index\n\nPUT /test_index/_mappings/test_doc\n{\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"field1\": {\n      \"type\": \"nested\"\n    },\n    \"field2\": {\n      \"type\": \"nested\"\n    },\n    \"field3\": {\n      \"type\": \"nested\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT /test_index/test_doc/1\n{\n  \"field1\": {\n    \"value\": \"100\"\n  },\n  \"field2\": {\n    \"value\": \"100\"\n  },\n  \"field3\": {\n    \"value\": \"100\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2 . Check that nested mappings are defined correctly\n\n```\nGET /test_index/_mappings/test_doc\n```\n\n```\n{\n   \"test_index\": {\n      \"mappings\": {\n         \"test_doc\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n               \"field1\": {\n                  \"type\": \"nested\",\n                  \"properties\": {\n                     \"value\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                     }\n                  }\n               },\n               \"field2\": {\n                  \"type\": \"nested\",\n                  \"properties\": {\n                     \"value\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                     }\n                  }\n               },\n               \"field3\": {\n                  \"type\": \"nested\",\n                  \"properties\": {\n                     \"value\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                     }\n                  }\n               }\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n3 . Try performing a nested filter query against the first-defined nested field. See that it correctly gets a hit.\n\n```\nGET /test_index/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"nested\": {\n          \"path\": \"field1\",\n          \"filter\": {\n              \"term\": { \"value\": \"100\" }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\n{\n   \"took\": 3,\n   \"timed_out\": false,\n   \"_shards\": {\n      \"total\": 5,\n      \"successful\": 5,\n      \"failed\": 0\n   },\n   \"hits\": {\n      \"total\": 1,\n      \"max_score\": 1,\n      \"hits\": [\n         {\n            \"_index\": \"test_index\",\n            \"_type\": \"test_doc\",\n            \"_id\": \"1\",\n            \"_score\": 1,\n            \"_source\": {\n               \"field1\": {\n                  \"value\": \"100\"\n               },\n               \"field2\": {\n                  \"value\": \"100\"\n               },\n               \"field3\": {\n                  \"value\": \"100\"\n               }\n            }\n         }\n      ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\n4 . Try performing a nested filter query against the the later-defined nested fields. See that they do not get hits.\n\n```\nGET /test_index/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"nested\": {\n          \"path\": \"field2\",\n          \"filter\": {\n              \"term\": { \"value\": \"100\" }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\n{\n   \"took\": 2,\n   \"timed_out\": false,\n   \"_shards\": {\n      \"total\": 5,\n      \"successful\": 5,\n      \"failed\": 0\n   },\n   \"hits\": {\n      \"total\": 0,\n      \"max_score\": null,\n      \"hits\": []\n   }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
