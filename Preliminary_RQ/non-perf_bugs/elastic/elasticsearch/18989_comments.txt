me give a example. Let's say I have a cluster with A and B, 2 nodes. And I have a daily rolling index named index_20160101, index_20160102 etc. at the beginning, all the shards are allocated one A and B.  one day, I added 2 nodes, C and D into cluster with rebalance set to false. (because I added nodes to cover write spikes) but when I add these 2 nodes, newly created index are all alocated on C and D because they carry little shards. but this is not I added nodes for. I added nodes to balance write traffic between A B C and D.\n so without consider overall shards allocation but only one index allocation, which means to see if shard per index is balanced acoss the nodes, I can achieve so.\nI actually do it by manually allocate shards with reroute API. but remember, I have to do it time to time. so this API is a bounds rather than necessarity.\nbut the use case is common.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/227397836","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18989#issuecomment-227397836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18989","id":227397836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzM5NzgzNg==","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T10:12:06Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T10:12:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If
