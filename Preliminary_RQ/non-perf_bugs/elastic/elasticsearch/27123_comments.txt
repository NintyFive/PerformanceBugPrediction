The bulk request got a little mangled but I can reproduce it.\r\n\r\nThis is expected behaviour as noted in https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/geo-shape.html#_accuracy and due to the way that Elasticsearch indexes geoshapes:\r\n\r\n> Geo_shape does not provide 100% accuracy and depending on how it is configured it may return some false positives or false negatives for certain queries. To mitigate this, it is important to select an appropriate value for the tree_levels parameter and to adjust expectations accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf you require more accuracy, please configure your mapping appropriately using the `precision` and `distance_error_pct` parameters.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
