This is because all the search related transport action extend from `AbstractAsyncAction`, which records the startTime of an request. \n\nWhat I think would be better if startTime becomes part of the ActionRequest (or an immediate abstract subclass) itself and for shard level related request classes we would then need another base class. So that enforcing that current time will evaluate constantly in all apis.\n","closed_by":{"login":"andyb-elastic","id":29205940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjA1OTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29205940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic","html_url":"https://github.com/andyb-elastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
