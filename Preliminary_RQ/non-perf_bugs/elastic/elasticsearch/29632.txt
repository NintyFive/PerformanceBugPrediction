I am sending 100 request (index, update) in every Bulk request. It gives me response with status of each request. Suppose my 97th request got fail, I have to make it loop to find the particular error document. I think its not optimize way. If i am sending more number of Bulk request, It makes my process slow. Is there any way where i will get only failed document or count of fail/success document in response?
