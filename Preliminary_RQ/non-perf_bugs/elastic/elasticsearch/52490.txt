I am not sure if the problem is a bug in Lucene or Elasticsearch being overly ambitious here. Given that we do corrupt the file I tend to think Lucene is at fault, but the comment [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/ff5dd14753c2588f3be1ac16e3adb4fe38c3f590/test/framework/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/test/CorruptionUtils.java#L84) could also indicate that this is simply a discrepancy in the checks?","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
