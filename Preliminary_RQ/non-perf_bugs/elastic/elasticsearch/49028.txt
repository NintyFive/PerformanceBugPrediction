Yet the landscape for retrieving fields today is complex. In fact, it requires expertise about a lot of different aspects. One needs to understand mappings, doc_values, stored fields. Complexities like becoming aware of the max doc_value field limit and then working around it by detecting a user requested more fields and trying to fetch them from `_source` instead.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, there is multi-fields. Which variant should I pick? How do I even detect that a field has multi-fields in order to avoid retrieving the same field multiple times? There is an answer to this of course (check there is a parent field that is not an object) but this is hopefully illustrating how complex this is. \r\n\r\nWriting code to do this for ML I have multiple stories about the complexities that arise. I think other users must have gone through a similar process.\r\n\r\nI propose a new API  that simply retrieves values given a list of fields. The API does not intend to do this in the most performant way. Rather, it intends to do it in the most user friendly way. It is an API that targets users that do not know the inner workings of elasticsearch and that have not yet detected a performance issue so that they begin an optimization journey (see \"is it faster to retrieve from _source or doc_values\" types of questions).\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
