The issue here is that `where id=3` should act on the value of a grouping (`GROUP BY id`) and this should, in fact, be a `HAVING` condition (condition applied on the result of an aggregation). Thinking about this purely from Elasticsearch point of view, a valid query would involve a [`terms` aggregation  and, with some limitations, a filter applied to it](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html#_filtering_values_3).\r\nBut then, doing `SELECT * FROM (SELECT id FROM test_groupby_subquery GROUP BY id) WHERE X`, means that the `WHERE` part should support all types of conditions that wouldn't work with the `terms` agg [limitations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html#_filtering_values_3) I mentioned above.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
