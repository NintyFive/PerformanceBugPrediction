There is no need to default publishing to host directly, to something we potentially didnt bind to, unless someone explicitly set publish host.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/154088452","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14561#issuecomment-154088452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14561","id":154088452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDA4ODQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"aleszoulek","id":270768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDc2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/270768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleszoulek","html_url":"https://github.com/aleszoulek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleszoulek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleszoulek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleszoulek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleszoulek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleszoulek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleszoulek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleszoulek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleszoulek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aleszoulek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T15:13:18Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T15:13:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That's my fault indeed.
