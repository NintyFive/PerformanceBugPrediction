This leads to the results containing a number of false positives. \n\nAn example of this can be seen at the following gist https://gist.github.com/nknize/abbcb87f091b891f85e1\n\nA work around is to set the `distance_error_pct` to something reasonable based on the size of your filter and location of your data.  For the worst case, (i.e., you expect a LOT of global filtering over global data spanning the map - and majority is at the equator) then set `distance_error_pct` to 0 and `tree_levels` to 32.  Doing this will force the filter to use a tree level of 32 which will give ~1m accuracy for results at the equator.  Note that this will also increase memory usage and the overall size of the index.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
