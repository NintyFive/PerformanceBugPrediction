is more a Logstash issue then Elasticsearch.\nthe logs that end up in that index most likely don't have a year specified in the original timestamp.\nThe default year is defined at startup of logstash which is most likely in 2014 causing logs without a year to get the 2014 year added.\nIf you restart Logstash now the logs should end up in the right index for 2015.\nWe are working on a solution.\n\nMore
