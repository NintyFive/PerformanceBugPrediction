Specific settings still exists (the netty ones per module of transport/http/memcached).\n\nAlso, create a more simplified setting for ports. Transport port can be set using `transport.tcp.port` (on top of the current `transport.netty.port`), HTTP port can be set using `http.port` (on top of `http.netty.port`), and memcached port can be set using `memcached.port` (on top of `memcached.netty.port`).\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
