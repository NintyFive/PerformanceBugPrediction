had this failure in a PR build: https://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+pull-request/311/console\r\n\r\nBut I found several instances over time in the CI mails,

some a while ago in February.\r\n \r\nIt seems a rare timing issue, so this doesn't reproduce for me locally:\r\n```\r\n./gradlew :server:test -Dtests.seed=F3E20416D514B7F4 -Dtests.class=org.elasticsearch.transport.RemoteClusterServiceTests -Dtests.method=\"testCollectSearchShards\" -Dtests.security.manager=true -Dtests.locale=es-MX -Dtests.timezone=HST -Dcompiler.java=10 -Druntime.java=8\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe failure shows the test is checking a latch after waiting for a second, maybe that is not long enough and should be increased.\r\n```\r\n11:20:48
