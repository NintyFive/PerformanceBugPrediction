I have just been able to get back to this. None of the curl commands you gave fail.\n\nThe below does still fail with \"Readable byte limit exceeded\".\n\n```\ncurl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_nodes'\n```\n\nUsing es-head and bigdesk I get the error on the node I'm connected to if I try to select any other node.\n\nWhat I've done since I opened this ticket:\n*) Upgraded to jdk 1.7.0_60-b19 and still have the error.\n*) Upgraded elasticsearch to 1.2.0 and still had the error.\n*) Saw the emergency update and upgraded to 1.2.1. Still had the error. Also, running \"elasticsearch-fix-routing-1.0.jar\" also produced the error.\n\n```\njava -jar elasticsearch-fix-routing-1.0.jar localhost 9300 myindex count\n```\n\n*) Took down all nodes and wiped out ES data directory. Started only 2 nodes completely fresh and still had the error.\n*) Dumped all data using elasticdump tool from community.\n*) Downgraded ES to 1.1.2 and imported all data using elasticdump again. Still receive the error.\n\nI'm using the same Centos 6, jdk, ES versions on all nodes. I have the latest es-head and bigdesk plugins installed on some nodes. I don't have any other transport agents on the network (I've taken ES down and sniffed network for any 9200/9300 traffic and there was none). I've used lsof to make sure the processes are not loading any old, or other, files or versions.\n\nI appreciate the assist. I must be missing something. Any further hints on how to troubleshoot this how ever technical?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/45835246","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5357#issuecomment-45835246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5357","id":45835246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODM1MjQ2","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-12T06:46:49Z","updated_at":"2014-06-12T06:46:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think I found it, it is a duplicate of #6325 - I will try to find a fix soon\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/48543902","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5357#issuecomment-48543902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5357","id":48543902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTQzOTAy","user":{"login":"daledude","id":590325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/590325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daledude","html_url":"https://github.com/daledude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daledude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daledude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daledude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daledude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daledude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daledude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daledude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daledude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daledude/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-09T22:32:50Z","updated_at":"2014-07-09T22:32:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks spinscale.
