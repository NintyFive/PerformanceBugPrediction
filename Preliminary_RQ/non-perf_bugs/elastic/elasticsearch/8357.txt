https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-6046 (to be in 4.10.3, once it's eventually released) we added protection to the various APIs (AutomatonQuery, RegexpQuery, etc.) that attempt to determinize an automaton, to give up when too many states would be created (e.g. the \"exponential\" worst-cases) instead of trying to consume tons of RAM/CPU.\n\nThe default limit is 10,000 states, but there could be real use cases that need a higher limit.\n\nOnce 4.10.3 is released and we've upgraded we need to expose control for this new limit in Elasticsearch's rest/client APIs when creating automaton queries.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikemccand","id":796508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/796508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemccand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
