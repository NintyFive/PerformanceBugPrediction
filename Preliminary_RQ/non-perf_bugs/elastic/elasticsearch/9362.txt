Using the transport client I get less results compared to that when I use the REST API. I don't understand why. Using the node client is unfortunately not possible, since my service using ES is not in the same network. Why are the results different?\n\nHere is the REST call:\n`POST /searchresults_sharded/article/_search\n{\n    \"query\" : {\n        \"match\" : {\n            \"titlebody\" : { \n                \"query\": \"japanische hundenamen\",\n                \"operator\" : \"and\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"aggregations\" : {\n        \"searchresults\" : {\n            \"significant_terms\" : { \n                \"field\" : \"titlebody\", \"size\" : 100\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}`\n\nand here the scala request building code:\n\n```\n   val builder = reqBuilder.searchReqBuilder\n\n    builder.setIndices(indexCoords.indexName)\n\n    builder.setTypes(indexCoords.typeName)\n\n    builder.setQuery(QueryBuilders.matchQuery(indexCoords.field, keywords.mkString(\" \")).operator(MatchQueryBuilder.Operator.AND))\n\n    val sigTermAggKey: String = \"significant-term\"\n\n    val sigTermBuilder = new SignificantTermsBuilder(sigTermAggKey)\n\n    sigTermBuilder.field(indexCoords.field)\n\n    sigTermBuilder.size(size)\n\n    builder.addAggregation(sigTermBuilder)\n```\n\nSee also my question here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28043622/different-set-of-results-for-significant-terms-in-elasticsearch-using-rest-api\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
