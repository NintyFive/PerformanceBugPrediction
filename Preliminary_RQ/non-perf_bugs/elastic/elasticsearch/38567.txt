you will see this exception: `Invalid format: [yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssXX]: Illegal pattern component: XX`\r\n* Look at the stack trace - you will see that the format string is being passed to Joda to interpret\r\n* Get the mappings via http://localhost:9200/airline_data/_mappings?pretty - you will see that the `8` has been lost:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"airline_data\" : {\r\n    \"mappings\" : {\r\n      \"_doc\" : {\r\n        \"properties\" : {\r\n          \"@timestamp\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"date\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"airline\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"keyword\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"responsetime\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"double\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"sourcetype\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"keyword\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"time\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"date\",\r\n            \"format\" : \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssXX\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case this is affected by in-flight PRs, this repro was done from 65f807c.\r\n\r\nUnless I'm mistaken I think this is a bad bug that needs to be fixed before 6.7.0 release, otherwise the BWC layer for time formats in 6.7 isn't really doing what it's supposed to.\r\n\r\n(For 7.x silently losing the `8` prefix is probably a good thing, as it seamlessly upgrades the mappings.)","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
