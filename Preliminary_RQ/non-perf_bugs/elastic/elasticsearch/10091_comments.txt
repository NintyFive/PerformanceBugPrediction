Expressions already support scores; the problems are with aggs.\n\nThe first problem is scorers are not passed through the many layers of objects consistently.  In the case of the `max` agg example there, I think there are at least 2 levels missing, first in the anonymous `LeafBucketCollectorBase`, and then in the anonymous `NumericDoubleValues` created in `MultiValueMode.MAX.select()`.\n\nThe bigger problem though is possibly more of a design problem that might prevent this from working. Within `getLeafCollector` of the `MaxAggregator`, `doubleValues()` is called before creating the `LeafBucketCollectorBase`, which binds the values object to a specific leaf reader (ie segment). The collector there is what implements `ScorerAware`.  However, expressions, in order to be efficient, map the bindings to concrete function values eagerly (when the binding to a leaf reader occurs). Here it looks like a lazy binding, which probably works fine for `groovy` since its variables are a hash based lookup, but not for expressions.  This eager binding is what allows expressions to be really fast.\n\nIt is possible though I misunderstood the aggs classes. @jpountz do you have any thoughts here?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/100771414","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10091#issuecomment-100771414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10091","id":100771414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDc3MTQxNA==","user":{"login":"egpbos","id":6146598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDY1OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6146598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egpbos","html_url":"https://github.com/egpbos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egpbos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egpbos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egpbos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egpbos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egpbos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egpbos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egpbos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egpbos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egpbos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-11T05:38:43Z","updated_at":"2015-05-11T05:38:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/102440835","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10091#issuecomment-102440835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10091","id":102440835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjQ0MDgzNQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-15T15:44:00Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T15:44:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jpountz
