For example, this is useful if you want to display a full month's calendar, but there is only a single entry.  Extended bounds will make sure the entire month is returned in the response (with empty buckets) to simplify client-side rendering.  Otherwise the client would have to fill in all the empty bucket itself.\r\n\r\nIf you want to limit the range, you'll have to use a range query as mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the future, please ask these sorts of questions on the [Elasticsearch forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).
