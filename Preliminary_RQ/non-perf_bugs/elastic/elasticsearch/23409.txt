The problem was/is that the query through Kibana drops cors headers from elastic search.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\n**Elasticsearch version**: 5.2.1\r\n**Plugins installed**: none\r\n**JVM version**:  OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-8u121-b13-0ubuntu1.16.04.2-b13)\r\n\r\n**OS version**: Docker Ubuntu (sebp/elk:521)\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nUsing metricbeat with ELK stack 5.2.1.\r\n\r\nAdded these lines\r\n\r\nhttp.cors.enabled: true\r\nhttp.cors.allow-origin: \"*\"\r\n\r\nto /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml and restarted the system. Still no cors headers is added.\r\n\r\nI checked with configuration error that the config file is in use for elastic search.\r\n\r\nTested headers:\r\n```\r\ncurl -H \"User-Agent: Mozilla\" -H \"Origin: http://example.com\" -i localhost:9206\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\ncontent-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\r\ncontent-length: 327\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"name\" : \"l2cjPKp\",\r\n  \"cluster_name\" : \"elasticsearch\",\r\n  \"cluster_uuid\" : \"sbZUro92QpGGVrhlsscx8A\",\r\n  \"version\" : {\r\n    \"number\" : \"5.2.1\",\r\n    \"build_hash\" : \"db0d481\",\r\n    \"build_date\" : \"2017-02-09T22:05:32.386Z\",\r\n    \"build_snapshot\" : false,\r\n    \"lucene_version\" : \"6.4.1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"tagline\" : \"You Know, for Search\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Docker image sebp/elk:521\r\n 2. Add config lines to elasticsearch.yml\r\n 3. No cors header is added by elastic search\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
