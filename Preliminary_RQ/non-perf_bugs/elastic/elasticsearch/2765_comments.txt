Sorry for the noise.\n\nBut I'm now thinking of a case where you're stuck with a `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` higher than your actual node count, if the cluster shrinks too rapidly (or if we didn't use `N <= 2 ? 1 : floor(N/2)+1` rule and set some tighter bound).\nIt's easy to test by starting one node, and giving a value of 2 to the setting. The node stops working and you can't reach it through HTTP to recover easily.\nThe only solution I see is to start multiple master-only nodes (can be on the same machine) to satisfy `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes`, then use the Cluster Update Settings API to lower the setting, wait for propagation, and shoot the temporary masters.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
