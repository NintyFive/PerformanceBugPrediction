I tried the server.policy file and I believe one other place that I can't recall at the moment...\n\n@phutchins Would you be willing to try adding it to `${path.plugins}/cloud-gce/plugin-security.policy` as I think that that is where you'll need to add it (depends on where your plugins are installed)? Can you add\n\n```\npermission java.lang.RuntimePermission \"setFactory\";\n```\n\nto the `grant` entries there? If you bump into any other permissions that are needed, add them there too (reading through the [code](https://github.com/google/google-http-java-client/blob/1.20.0/google-http-client/src/main/java/com/google/api/client/http/javanet/NetHttpTransport.java) and the [docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/HttpsURLConnection.html), another one that _might_ come up is `permission javax.net.ssl.SSLPermission \"setHostnameVerifier\";`). Please note that adding any additional security permissions is at your own risk. You can read about the [`setFactory` runtime permission](http://download.java.net/jdk7/archive/b123/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimePermission.html) and the _possible_ [`setHostNameVerifier` SSL permission](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLPermission.html) but if you report them back here we will do a thorough investigation on them in advance of the next patch release.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/188824678","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16485#issuecomment-188824678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16485","id":188824678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODgyNDY3OA==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T15:02:53Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T15:02:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@phutchins I'd like to make sure this can be addressed for a maintenance release.
