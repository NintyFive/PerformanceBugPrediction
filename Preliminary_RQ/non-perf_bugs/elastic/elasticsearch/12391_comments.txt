(with a NOTE: in the commit msg stating wherelse it can occur)\n5) also reusing some redundant code.\n\nBy the way,\ncomments or new opinions can be given as new review comments and not new PR's ....\nthis statement is made by me with the thinking that \"We are all working as a team . So we should not allow wasting time working on issues others are already working on. If N people work on a project and N people raise PR's on the same issue I feel that it is a waste of time\" .\n\nHappy Learning,\nThanks, it was just my opinion given to my friend.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
