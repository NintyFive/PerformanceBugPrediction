The `format` parameter is supported by the json parser in 1.7, so using the query DSL should work here. The 2.x branch also already has a setter for the `format` parameter in the RangeQueryBuilder (FilterBuilders are merged with QueryBuilders starting with 2.x). @clintongormley I don't think we still add non-critical changes to the 1.7 branches, so I think this can be closed, but please reopen if I'm missing something.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/191160997","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16768#issuecomment-191160997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16768","id":191160997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTE2MDk5Nw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-02T09:48:41Z","updated_at":"2016-03-02T09:48:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cbuescher agreed - thanks for looking at it\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
