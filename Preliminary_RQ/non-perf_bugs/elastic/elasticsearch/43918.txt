today I tried to run the `thirdPartyAudit` task for the `repository-s3` project but the task is always skipped:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew :plugins:repository-s3:thirdPartyAudit --info\r\n...\r\n> Task :plugins:repository-s3:thirdPartyAudit SKIPPED\r\nSkipping task ':plugins:repository-s3:thirdPartyAudit' as task onlyIf is false.\r\n```\r\n\r\n@ywelsch found that the task is disabled by https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/4586f2928cc3a0f729692b25c54c746ed730dd52/buildSrc/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/gradle/testfixtures/TestFixturesPlugin.java#L59 when a docker-compose.yml file exists in the project. \r\n\r\nSo I commented out the lines that disable the 3rd party audit task and the task is now executed but fails (which I kind of expected because of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/43671).\r\n\r\nI'm filling this issue to ensure that `thirdPartyAudit` tasks are correctly executed on CI.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
