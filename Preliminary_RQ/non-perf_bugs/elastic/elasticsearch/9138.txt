One such component is a monitoring system which monitors all the other components and this is done 24/7.  Our customers are typically large companies that have their own in house monitoring departments.  A common requirement is that our monitoring component integrates into theirs such that all support is driven via their helpdesk and 1st line support.\n\nI love ELK and have found the \"insights\" it provides from our logs far more useful than the various metrics available from our own monitoring product!  However, the one thing that prevents me from adopting it is that I cannot integrate it into 3rd party monitoring systems; I cannot generate \"northbound\" alarms from ELK to our customers monitoring system, which is typically Nagios.\n\nWhat I would like is to be able to set a threshold on a particular graph and generate an alarm if this threshold is breached.\n\nFor instance, lets say I have a graph in Kibana of HTTP responses.  I would like to set an alarm that triggers if the number of responses with status 200 falls to 0 averaged over a configurable period.\n\nIs this at all feasible?  It is the alarming that regrettably steers customers towards Splunk over ELK.\n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
