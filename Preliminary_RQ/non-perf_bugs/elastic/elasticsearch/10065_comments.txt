Either of these can contain queries, post-filters, aggs, suggestions etc.  DELETE _query is delete-by-query, and all it accepts is a query, nothing else.\n\nWe're trying to reduce \"synonyms\" in the API, so I'm not keen to add more options - i think that would just add to the confusion.\n\nMost people will be using one of the official clients, which I think are a bit clearer, eg:\n\n```\n$es->search( body => { query => {....}})\n$es->delete_by_query( body => { query => {...}})\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
