If you create a repo and snapshot, then delete these objects, Elasticsearch will somehow retain a record of the snapshot indices and refuse to create the snapshots even after the repo, snapshot and backed up index files are deleted.\n\nHere are the steps to reproduce the problem:\n1. Create repo A:\n   curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/A' -d '\n   {\n   \"type\": \"fs\",\n   \"settings\": {\n       \"location\": \"/media/snaps0\",\n       \"compress\": true\n   }\n   }'\n2. Create snapshot B containing indices X and Y:\n   curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/A/B' -d '\n   {\n   \"indices\": [\n       \"X\", \"Y\"\n   ],\n   \"ignore_unavailable\": \"true\",\n   \"include_global_state\": false\n   }'\n3. Verify snapshot created in /media/snaps0, directory structure should look like this:\n   /media/snaps0/index\n   /media/snaps0/metadata-A  (might not be quite the right name for this file)\n   /media/snaps0/snapshot-A\n   /media/snaps0/indices/X   (index files in this directory not shown)\n   /media/snaps0/indices/Y   (index files in this directory not shown)\n4. Delete the repo, snapshot and files in /media/snaps0:\n   curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/A/B'\n   curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/A'\n   rm -rf /media/snaps0/*\n5. Recreate the same repo and snapshot by repeating steps 1 and 2.\n6. Repeating step 3 to verify the contents of /media/snaps0 will show that the /media/snaps0/indices folder is not created.\n\nSomehow Elasticsearch 1.3.2 seems to think that the snapshot of X and Y still exists and refuses to re-snapshot them the second time around.  I thinks this is a bug, because I followed the directions on snapshot and restore from the Elasticsearch.org online documentation.\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
