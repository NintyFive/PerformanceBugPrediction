Currently, in order to force a segment merge for these indices (with just 1 segment), we can modify the index mapping to disable norms for these indices, add a dummy document with these fields (now with norms disabled), and optimize again.\n\nIt will be nice to provide a way to drop norms for these optimized indices without having to ingest a dummy document.  I think there was an attempt to provide a force option (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/5294) but was subsequently deprecated in 1.4 (http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/indices-optimize.html)\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
