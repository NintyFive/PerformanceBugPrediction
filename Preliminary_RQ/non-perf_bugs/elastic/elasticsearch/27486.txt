The use case is straight forward:\r\n\r\nImagine that you have a lot of data (e.g., logging) that has a mostly-stable format. However, from time-to-time, there are changes that can come in that need to be manually cleaned up. Instead of requiring that the  user setup error handling in their clients to reroute the failed document(s), a post-ingest processor could be executed.\r\n\r\nThis would make it trivial to send documents that fail to be indexed to a dead letter queue. Ideally the handler would itself be an ordinary ingest processor, thus behaving in the same way that they do without too much effort.","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
