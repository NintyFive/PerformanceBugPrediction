If your application takes responsibility for breaking the text into paragraphs e.g. as nested documents it would be possible to select only the paragraph docs that fully matched your query logic. This would be a more complex arrangement and complicate both the query and indexing logic.\n\nClosing, not because it's not a legitimate complaint but because we've thought about this for a long time in Lucene land and don't think there's a good solution.
