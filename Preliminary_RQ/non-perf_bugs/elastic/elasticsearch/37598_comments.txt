That allows \"paging\" over the results of an aggregation in a memory-friendly manner.\r\n\r\nWe can't allow unlimited buckets for non-composite aggregations because they have to store their working state in-memory...and \"unlimited\" is a very large number :)  Composite agg works around this by breaking the agg up over multiple requests (one per \"page\") and having the client buffer the information client-side. \r\n\r\nAlso in the future, please open questions like this on the [discuss forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).
