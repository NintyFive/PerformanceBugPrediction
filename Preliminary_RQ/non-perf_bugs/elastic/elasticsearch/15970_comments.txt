The first is that we're now managing two directory trees which may or may not overlap, so you have to be extra careful when creating them, cleaning them up or moving them around.  The chance of introducing bugs here is high.\n\nThe second is that we have just moved away from splitting shards across multiple paths to ensuring that a single shard is contained entirely on a single disk.  The reason for this was to avoid the loss of one path corrupting all of your shards.  If users have a separate path just for translogs then we're back to the same situation.\n\nMy feeling is: if your disks aren't keeping up, then get SSDs or add more hardware.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/171930335","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15970#issuecomment-171930335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15970","id":171930335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTkzMDMzNQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-15T10:41:26Z","updated_at":"2016-01-15T10:41:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Discussed this in FixItFriday - @s1monw pointed out two important issues:\n- An entire shard needs to belong to a single path so that it if any part fails, the whole shard fails.\n- When nodes are shut down, they flush to disk, meaning that there is no translog to replay on startup.  Only in case of disastrous shutdown do translogs need to be replayed.  Introducing the complexity of multiple paths for this outlier is not worth it.\n\nClosing\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
