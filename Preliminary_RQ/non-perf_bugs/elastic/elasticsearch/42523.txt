But the date ingest processor only outputs millisecond precision, so any nanosecond precision timestamp that is extracted via the date ingest processor is truncated to millisecond precision.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this happens is that the output format of the date ingest processor is hardcoded to `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX`.\r\n\r\nSwitching the date ingest processor to always output nanosecond precision timestamps might be a step too far - date fields would become more verbose, use more storage and might potentially cause backwards compatibility problems.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be nice if the ingest date processor had an option to output nanosecond precision timestamps if the user specifically asked for that.","closed_by":{"login":"danhermann","id":22777892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzc3ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22777892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann","html_url":"https://github.com/danhermann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
