It is the equivalent of passing an array of values to the field.  The `_all` field works in the same way.  Its purpose is to create a custom `_all` field (out of potentially large text fields) which can be searched as if it were one field, not to create a single field value.  Concatenation raises other questions like what should the concatenation character be?\n\nIf you want to do this, you should simply provide the concatenated field in your document.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
