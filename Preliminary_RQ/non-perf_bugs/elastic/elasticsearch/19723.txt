It would be good to settle on a convention for readability and consistency, and so we don't have to resort to discussions on every PR about what the proper name should be.\n\nIn terms of location, we have many index level settings in `IndexSettings`, many in `IndexMetaData`, then others scattered around in other places specific to the class that it is most associated with (e.g. `index.mapping.coerce` which is found in `FieldMapper#COERCE_SETTING`).  It would be good to discuss if we are fine with this ad hoc approach to locating index settings, or if we want some more consistency, where should they all go?  Should there be a dedicated constants class for this?\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
