We have an automated deployment process that can grab an RPM and put it onto an instance and then bake the image for deployment to multiple instances. However this gets broken by the RPM due to it automatically switching on the elasticsearch service on installation.\n\nFedora suggest that you should not automatically switch on the service as this is insecure, instead you should rely on the init.d script via chkconfig to switch on the service:\n\nhttp://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:SysVInitScript#Why_don.27t_we....\n\nQuote:\n\n> start the service after installation? \n> Installations can be in changeroots, in an installer context, or in other situations \n> where you don't want the services started. \"\n\nI'm happy to submit a patch if you think this is valid.\n\nDip\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
