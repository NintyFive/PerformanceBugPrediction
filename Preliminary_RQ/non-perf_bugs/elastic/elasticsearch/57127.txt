After team discussion we came to the following solution for this:\r\n- Names for both data stream and indices will be passed in indices fields (as in other APIs)\r\n- When user requests to snapshot data stream we save data stream metadata and all backing indices\r\n- When user requests to snapshot backing index we only save that index and no data stream metadata is stored\r\n- When user requests to restore backing index we donâ€™t restore data stream metadata at all, restored index will not be added to any data stream\r\n- When user requests to restore data stream we restore its metadata as well as all backing indices\r\n- Renaming should be supported, we rename data stream and all backing indices, conflicts with existing indices will fail as always\r\n- We will add API to added index to data stream to support restoring only some backing indices\r\n\r\nRelates to #53100 ","closed_by":{"login":"probakowski","id":3896475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTY0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3896475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski","html_url":"https://github.com/probakowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/probakowski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
