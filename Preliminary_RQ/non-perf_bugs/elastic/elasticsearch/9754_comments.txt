It looks like this one might have got missed so the transform API's parser should be updated to use the stuff from this PR. \n\nAt the time we settled on the convention that the options should be `script` for inline scripts, `script_file` for file scripts and `script_id` for indexed scripts. `file` is ambiguous as it's not explicit that it refers to a file for a script, the file could be for something else.\n\nI would say that we should update the transform API to use the ScriptParameterParser like the rest of the script APIs, but I would be -1 for adding the `file` parameter to the docs as this name is effectively deprecated and users should be using `script_file` instead.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/75070631","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9754#issuecomment-75070631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9754","id":75070631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDcwNjMx","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-19T15:26:22Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T15:26:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1
