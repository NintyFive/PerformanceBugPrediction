It means the setting would kick in for a corresponding forceMerge, and also kick in even when indexing is happening, for fields that are \"no longer being indexed to\" .\n- ElasticSearchDirectoryReader could also apply the same FilterCodecReader at read time when segments have norms but mappings has them turned off. This means you could issue a close/open index and the norms are disabled instantly (they are still on disk, but will not be loaded into RAM).\n- We could try to fix/add back the force option in some way.\n- (other simpler or more complicated solutions).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/88924797","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10383#issuecomment-88924797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10383","id":88924797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4OTI0Nzk3","user":{"login":"mikemccand","id":796508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/796508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemccand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemccand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-02T14:20:41Z","updated_at":"2015-04-02T14:20:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n\nI like the ESDirectoryReader solution?
