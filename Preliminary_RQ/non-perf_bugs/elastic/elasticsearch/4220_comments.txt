Some of my requests I'd rather fail fast and others I'd rather let them wait.  It isn't a big deal, the bulk commands that I need to fail fast I can convert into repeated update/index/delete calls and get a similar effect without too much overhead.  They aren't huge bulk commands.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/28929763","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4220#issuecomment-28929763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4220","id":28929763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTI5NzYz","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-20T20:52:16Z","updated_at":"2013-11-20T20:52:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"fixed the delete docs: a9880dcbf1130381c4643bda1bf7e9ca0c64494a\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/29200700","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4220#issuecomment-29200700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4220","id":29200700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjAwNzAw","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-25T13:20:27Z","updated_at":"2013-11-25T13:20:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
