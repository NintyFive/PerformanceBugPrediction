However, only version 5.0.0 is there, while the transport and sniffer are there in version 5.0.1. Looks like the REST client has been forgotten during the latest update.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the same [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/5.x/_maven_repository.html) proposes the following dependency:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>org.elasticsearch.client</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>rest</artifactId>\r\n    <version>5.1.0</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe version should be ``5.0.1``. Is this maybe an auto-increment in the wrong place?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Go to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.elasticsearch.client%22)\r\n 2.
