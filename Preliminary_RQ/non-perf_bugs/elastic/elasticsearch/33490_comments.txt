However, the problem here is curl. You need to use `--head` instad of `-XHEAD` to get `curl` to behave properly. To quote the man page:\r\n\r\n> This  option  only  changes  the  actual  word  used in the HTTP\r\n> request, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for  example\r\n> if  you  want  to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD will\r\n> not suffice. You need to use the -I, --head option.\r\n\r\nSee also https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2015/09/11/unnecessary-use-of-curl-x/ for further info.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/419337311","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33490#issuecomment-419337311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33490","id":419337311,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTMzNzMxMQ==","user":{"login":"Wing924","id":8895721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4OTU3MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8895721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wing924","html_url":"https://github.com/Wing924","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wing924/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wing924/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wing924/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wing924/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wing924/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wing924/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wing924/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wing924/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wing924/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-07T06:31:40Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T06:31:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@danielmitterdorfer Thank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
