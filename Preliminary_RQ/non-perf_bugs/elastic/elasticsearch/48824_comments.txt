Been traveling for work lately and my inbox has been a mess.\r\n\r\nYou can certainly work on this issue if you like!  It shouldn't be too difficult, but also not the easiest first issue either.  The actual change is relatively small but it requires knowing how our static json parsers work which can be a little tricky.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to work on it I'm happy to help.  You might also want to skim through the list of issues tagged with `help needed` or `good first issue` which have been specifically called out as items which are good for first time contributors","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/555217801","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48824#issuecomment-555217801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48824","id":555217801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTIxNzgwMQ==","user":{"login":"ejmiers","id":25211363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjExMzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/25211363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejmiers","html_url":"https://github.com/ejmiers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejmiers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejmiers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejmiers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejmiers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejmiers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejmiers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejmiers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejmiers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejmiers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-18T21:29:43Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T21:29:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, I think maybe I'll leave this one for someone else to tackle.
