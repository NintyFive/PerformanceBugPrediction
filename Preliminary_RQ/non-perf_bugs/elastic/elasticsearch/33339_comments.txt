Those forums are designed to support the kinds of conversations that are necessary for this sort of troubleshooting and problem diagnosis.\r\n\r\nElastic uses GitHub issues for tracking clearly identified bugs and feature requests. Although it is _possible_ that your problem is caused by an Elasticsearch bug, we do not have enough information here to be able to determine that and identify the cause. I'm going to close this ticket, but if you start a discussion on our [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch), and that analysis determines that there is  bug to be fixed, then we can reopen this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
