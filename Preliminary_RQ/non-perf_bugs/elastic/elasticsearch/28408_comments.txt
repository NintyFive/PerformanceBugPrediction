I can't reproduce it, but from the stacktrace in the discuss post it *looks* like this isn't an \"all the time\" thing. It *looks* like this is triggered when log4j goes digging around in the filesystem which it doesn't do all the time. I'm going to open a PR that goes under the assumption that this is caused by that.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/362055789","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28408#issuecomment-362055789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/28408","id":362055789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjA1NTc4OQ==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-31T20:10:30Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T20:10:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK.
