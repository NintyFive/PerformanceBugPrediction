The `query_string` query is a complex beast which I would avoid if at all possible.  You can see the problem if you run your query through the `validate-query` API:\n\n```\nGET /test/_validate/query?explain\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n      \"default_field\": \"doc.token\",\n      \"query\": \"token:\\\\/abc.123.S*\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis returns:\n\n```\n\"explanation\": \"token:/abc.123.s*\"\n```\n\nYou see how the `S` has been lowercased? If you change the query as follows, it works:\n\n```\nGET /test/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n      \"default_field\": \"doc.token\",\n      \"query\": \"token:\\\\/abc.123.S*\",\n      \"lowercase_expanded_terms\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut if you don't want analysis, why not just use the term-level `wildcard` query instead:\n\n```\nGET /test/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"wildcard\": {\n      \"token\": \"/abc.123.S*\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlso, wildcard queries are not terribly efficient.
