Im using Java API and followed all guide but i got these exception below:\n\norg.elasticsearch.common.collect.ComputationException: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/lucene/analysis/ga/IrishAnalyzer\n\nI searched any-all Google results and much of them say that this issue is related with Maven dependency besides it is not meaningful to me. Here is my usage:\n\nNode node = NodeBuilder.nodeBuilder().node();\nClient _nodeClient = node.client();\nSearchResponse resSearch = null;\ntry{\nresSearch = _nodeClient.prepareSearch(\"videos\")\n.setSearchType(SearchType.DEFAULT)\n.setQuery(QueryBuilders.queryString(\"q:anytext\"))\n.setFrom(0).setSize(60).setExplain(true)\n.execute()\n.actionGet();\n\nCould you give a hand pls? I can not keep moving on :(\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
