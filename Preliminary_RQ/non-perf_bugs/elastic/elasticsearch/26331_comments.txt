Instead, any secret must be defined in the Elasticsearch Keystore (see [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/secure-settings.html#creating-keystore)) as a secured setting. \r\n\r\nFor now these settings are not reloadable but there is an ongoing effort (#29135) to make them reloadable. This way, the Azure/S3/GCS settings will be updatable in the keystore specified at the elasticsearch startup.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to close this issue as we won't allow to specify credentials using the Rest API in the future.
