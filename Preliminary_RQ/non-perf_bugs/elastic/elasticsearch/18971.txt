The base similarity is used to compute a factor for the coordinates and the query norm (cf Similarity.coord and Similarity.queryNorm).\nIt is a per query setting that can change the score completely. For `BM25` the coord and the queryNorm are disabled (returns 1.0f) whereas they are important factors in the `classic` similarity. To resolve this we have two settings for the index similarity `index.similarity.default.type` and `index.similarity.base.type`.\nIn order to make the things easier we could have a single setting:\n`index.similarity.type`\n... that is dynamically updatable if the similarities are compatible: \nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6727\nThis would not make the \"are compatible?\" easier but this would prevent the user to shoot themselves in the foot.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
