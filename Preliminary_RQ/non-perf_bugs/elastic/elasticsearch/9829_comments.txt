Its probably better than some fancy weighting algorithms because its pretty simple and creates a hard and fast rule.  My cluster has ~1800 indexes and only about 20 of them produce enough load that I set this on them.  It works well.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/75636299","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9829#issuecomment-75636299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9829","id":75636299,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NjM2Mjk5","user":{"login":"tnine","id":249532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTUzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/249532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine","html_url":"https://github.com/tnine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-23T21:20:55Z","updated_at":"2015-02-23T21:20:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Awesome, so we need to set this per index then?
