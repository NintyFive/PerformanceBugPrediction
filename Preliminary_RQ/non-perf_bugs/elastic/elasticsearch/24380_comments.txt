You can compare the same if you cat `/proc/<pid>/limits` for the running Elasticsearch process (start it without binding transport so that the bootstrap checks aren't enforced, and then do this for the Elasticsearch pid and you'll see `/proc/<pid>/limits` shows the same). What I think you're seeing is that you did not start a new shell that did not derive from your currently existing shell after increasing the limit to unlimited. Resource limits are preserved across [`fork(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html), so if you do not, for example, log out and log back in, you'll be stuck with the old limits.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/297885210","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24380#issuecomment-297885210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24380","id":297885210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Nzg4NTIxMA==","user":{"login":"russmac","id":5924967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjQ5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5924967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/russmac","html_url":"https://github.com/russmac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russmac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russmac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russmac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russmac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russmac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russmac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russmac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russmac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/russmac/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-28T01:46:33Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T02:59:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">> What I think you're seeing is that you did not start a new shell that did not derive from your currently existing shell after increasing the limit to unlimited.\r\n\r\nNo, I did not do that at all.\r\n\r\nI rebooted so the limit worked, and checked it with ulimit -a.
