The machine_learning_admin and machine_learning_user roles provide the necessary combination of cluster and index privileges to use this API.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the extra privilege requirement is that it gives administrators who want to restrict users to seeing the results of some jobs but not others a way to achieve this. It can be done by setting different results indexes for particular groups of jobs, or by applying document level security based on the job_id field.\r\n\r\nThis same information applies to all 4 results APIs: buckets, records, influencers and categories.
