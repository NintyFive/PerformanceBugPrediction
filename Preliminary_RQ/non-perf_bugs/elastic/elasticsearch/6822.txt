You could implement this check using update scripts but its a bit jangly to do generically.  It'd be way more convenient if you could have Elasticsearch do the detection for you.  Something like:\n\n``` js\ncurl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/test/type1/1/_update' -d '{\n    \"doc\" : {\n        \"name\" : \"new_name\"\n    },\n    \"doc_as_upsert\" : true,\n    \"detect_noop\": true\n}'\n```\n\nDetecting the noop rather then just performing the update could prevent extra writes and deleted documents.\n\nSecondarily, it might be cool to be able to specify tolerances for numeric fields so small changes could be ignored but that might be out of scope for any initial implementation.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
