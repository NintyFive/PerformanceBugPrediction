AWS now has native support for authenticating via AWS SSO and other identity providers can be used by setting `credential_process` in `~/.aws/credentials`. We use the `credential_process` property to authenticate on AWS via Kerberos, which is far more secure than using AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (that is the current alternative). Either way, I don't think Elastic should be the one deciding whether or not some authentication method is secure or not and that it can be used. By using the DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain, you leave this responsibility to AWS and decrease compatibility issues when using different authentication methods.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/720349004","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56168#issuecomment-720349004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56168","id":720349004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDM0OTAwNA==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-02T09:24:13Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T09:24:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We use the `credential_process` property to authenticate on AWS via Kerberos\r\n\r\nThis would require Elasticsearch to run an external process, which [we forbid at a very low level](https://www.elastic.co/blog/seccomp-in-the-elastic-stack).
