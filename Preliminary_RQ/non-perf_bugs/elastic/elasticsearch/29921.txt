It doesn't add any ingestion features, it adds data processing capabilities to Elasticsearch's existing ingest (document indexing api) capability.\r\n* Pipeline - In Logstash, this refers to the data flow in and out of Logstash. In Ingest Node, this refers to an ordered set of processors. These (ingest node vs logstash) are not really compatible concepts.\r\n\r\nMy main point is to identify the problem (bad terminology), not necessarily to provide a solution. However, I will try to make a proposal:\r\n\r\n* Rename Ingest Node to `Processor Node`\r\n* Come up with a term that represents the \"Processing-only\" capabilities of the currently-named Ingest Node and use this term for both Logstash filters as well as Ingest Node's currently-named \"pipeline\"\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
