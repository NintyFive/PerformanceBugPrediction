The two queries affected are query_string and simple_query_string, as they allow users to set the `locale` used where applicable, depending on the type of lucene query that gets parsed.\n\nBoth queries in master parse the locale through our own `LocaleUtils#parse` method and print it out using`Locale#toString` when needed. It turns out that with some locales, our newly added query tests fail given that printing out and reparsing the same locale leads to a different locale. The problem looks very similar to what is explained here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-4021.\n\nI see that we also use `LocaleUtils#parse` in `DateFieldMapper`. I think that we should discuss how to address this issue and streamline the solution. I think the best solution would be to parse through `Locale#forLanguageTag` and print out using `Locale#toLanguageTag`, but this breaks backwards compatibility it seems. If I make this change `SimpleDateMappingTests#testParseLocal` fails for instance. Is also our own `LocaleUtils` still useful?\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
