I will try to explain what I did:\n\nFrom a fresh ElasticSearch 1.6.0 on Windows, I created a file for the mapping:\n_config\\mappings\\_default\\tweet.json_\n\n```\n{\n    \"tweet\" : {\n        \"_timestamp\" : {\n            \"enabled\" : true,\n            \"path\" : \"post_date\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFrom my understanding, at the first document creation in tweet type, ES will create a timestamp date inside the field post_date.\nSo let's try to put something in tweet:\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/foo/tweet?pretty -d '\n{\n    \"Message\": \"Hello\"\n}'\n```\n\nAnd the result is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"_index\" : \"foo\",\n  \"_type\" : \"tweet\",\n  \"_id\" : \"AU54jUpV_Q4fyYYVxweD\",\n  \"_version\" : 1,\n  \"created\" : true\n}\n```\n\nOn ES, no error:  _[Moonstone] [foo] update_mapping [tweet](dynamic)_\n\nLet's check the mapping for tweet:\ncurl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/foo/_mapping/tweet' \n\n```\n{\"foo\":{\"mappings\":{\"tweet\":{\"_timestamp\":{\"enabled\":true,\"path\":\"post_date\"},\"properties\":{\"Message\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}}}}}\n```\n\nSo it seems the timestamp is enabled for tweet type.\n\nI will GET the first document:\ncurl -XGET http://localhost:9200/foo/tweet/AU54jUpV_Q4fyYYVxweD?pretty\n\n```\n{\n  \"_index\" : \"foo\",\n  \"_type\" : \"tweet\",\n  \"_id\" : \"AU54jUpV_Q4fyYYVxweD\",\n  \"_version\" : 1,\n  \"found\" : true,\n  \"_source\":\n{\n\"Message\": \"Hello\"\n}\n}\n```\n\nSo finally, the field 'post_date' isn't generated. Maybe it's my bad and I did something wrong, but I've got no clue what.\n\nYohann \n","closed_by":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
