The only way to get this information is to open the index. About the only thing we could change is to include the primary and replica settings for closed indices (because those come from the cluster state). However, there is no guarantee that they reflect what is on the disk.  You could delete the closed index and add another with the same name and different settings, and we would be none the wiser until trying to open the index.\n\nI think I've just convinced myself that we shouldn't change this.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/130609909","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12847#issuecomment-130609909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12847","id":130609909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDYwOTkwOQ==","user":{"login":"markwalkom","id":3184718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODQ3MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3184718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom","html_url":"https://github.com/markwalkom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markwalkom/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-13T10:45:01Z","updated_at":"2015-08-13T10:47:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There's no chance we can keep some sort of data in cluster state on this?\nI think it'd be very useful, even if not just for _cat.\n\nAnd yeah, I can appreciate that someone could delete the files etc etc, but the likelihood of that versus the ability to be able to see what's on a node -
