The reason is that there's no extra variable that goes into our calculation _yet_ to adjust based on collection size. That won't change in 5.0, but I do expect it to change in a 5.x release.\n\nIn the mean time, I think the best course is to just do exactly what you're doing. You can change the default time picker in the Advanced -> Settings screen to be `now-4h` to get the expected view without having to click anything.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/288163167","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18947#issuecomment-288163167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18947","id":288163167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODE2MzE2Nw==","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-21T17:51:08Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T17:51:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Since this is an issue relating to x-pack I have raised an issue in our internal bug tracker for X-Pack.
