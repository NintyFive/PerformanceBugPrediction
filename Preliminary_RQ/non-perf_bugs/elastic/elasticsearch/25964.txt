The virtual machines were sharing the same $JAVA_HOME and $ES_HOME installations on the NFS. I had a custom configuration for each node, and I was starting the ES nodes with a command like:\r\n`$ES_HOME/bin/elasticsearch -Epath.conf=/my/super/secret/config`\r\n\r\nI had set them up to use 16g of memory on their custom config directories. However, when I decided to use ES 5.5.1 I was having lots of java out of memory exceptions. I double checked the config files, and everything seem ok, until I finally noticed the nodes were starting with only 2g. Then, I updated the file under `$ES_HOME/config/jvm.options` and it took the changes.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I was expecting ES to load the **jvm.options** under `/my/super/secret/config` but it was using the one at `$ES_HOME/config`","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
