I use a bool query but when running this under script_score it results in a null pointer exception. If I remove the bool query and run a simple match query it works. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1.
