Any that are older than 30 days are closed.\n\nI'm seeing strange behavior when trying to do a match_all query on `error_messages-*`.\n\nThis is using the Java  transport client. ES version 1.6.0.\n\n```\nSearchResponse sr = client.prepareSearch(\"error_messages-*\")\n  .setQuery(QueryBuilders.matchAllQuery())\n  .execute().actionGet();\nthrows:\norg.elasticsearch.indices.IndexClosedException: [logstash-2015.07.30] closed\n```\n\nSo I set `IndicesOptions.lenientExpandOpen()` to ignore unavailable indices and got a different (but similiar) error.\n\n```\nSearchResponse sr = client.prepareSearch(\"error_messages-*\")\n  .setQuery(QueryBuilders.matchAllQuery())\n  .setIndicesOptions(IndicesOptions.lenientExpandOpen())\n  .execute().actionGet();\nthrows:\norg.elasticsearch.cluster.block.ClusterBlockException: blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/4/index closed]\n```\n\nInterestingly, this query works via HTTP API in Marvel:\n\n```\nPOST error_messages-*/_search?ignore_unavailable=true\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match_all\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlso interesting is if I use the concrete index pattern `logstash-*`, the queries work in Java.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
