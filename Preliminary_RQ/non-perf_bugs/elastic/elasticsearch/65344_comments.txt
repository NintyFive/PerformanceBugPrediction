Please consult TESTING.asciidoc for more information. In general, question like these are better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead if you have furhter trouble. Many thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
