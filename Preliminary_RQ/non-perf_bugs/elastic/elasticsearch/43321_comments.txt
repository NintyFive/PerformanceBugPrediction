If you can stop \r\nby there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified \r\nbug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/)\r\nthat should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I \r\nhope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\nA few hints before you head to Discuss:\r\n\r\n* This does not reproduce locally (with Docker 18.09.2) and is likely an environmental issue\r\n* Please also include your Docker version (`docker info`). If it is rather old you might want to upgrade it.\r\n* Please format plain text snippets so they are easier to read.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
