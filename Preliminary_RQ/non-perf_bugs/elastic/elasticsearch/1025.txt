This feature can be used together with filtering aliases in order to avoid unnecessary shard operations.\n\nThe following command creates a new alias \"alias1\" that points to index \"test\". After \"alias1\" is created, all operations with this alias are automatically modified to use value \"1\" for routing.\n\n```\n$ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_aliases' -d '\n{\n    \"actions\" : [\n        {\n            \"add\" : {\n                 \"index\" : \"test\",\n                 \"alias\" : \"alias1\",\n                 \"routing\" : \"1\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nIt’s also possible to specify different routing values for searching and indexing operations:\n\n```\n$ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_aliases' -d '\n{\n    \"actions\" : [\n        {\n            \"add\" : {\n                 \"index\" : \"test\",\n                 \"alias\" : \"alias2\",\n                 \"search-routing\" : \"1,2\",\n                 \"index-routing\" : \"2\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nAs shown in the example above, search routing may contain several values separated by comma. Index routing can contain only a single value. \n\nIf an operation that uses routing alias also has a routing parameter, an intersection of both alias routing and routing specified in the parameter is used. For example the following command will use \"2\" as a routing value:\n\n```\n$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/alias2/_search?q=user:kimchy&routing=2,3'\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
