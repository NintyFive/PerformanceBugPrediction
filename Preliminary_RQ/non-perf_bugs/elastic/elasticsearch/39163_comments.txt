While being able to set this setting lower has been occasionally useful in the past for more quickly reproducing race conditions, if we need to do that, it can always be done in a custom build with the lower limit disabled.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/468964648","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39163#issuecomment-468964648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39163","id":468964648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODk2NDY0OA==","user":{"login":"ApolloTheDeveloper","id":38534801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTM0ODAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/38534801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ApolloTheDeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/ApolloTheDeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ApolloTheDeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ApolloTheDeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ApolloTheDeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ApolloTheDeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ApolloTheDeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ApolloTheDeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ApolloTheDeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ApolloTheDeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ApolloTheDeveloper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-02T22:03:16Z","updated_at":"2019-03-02T22:03:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello all,\r\nI am a new developer and I would really like to contribute to this project.
