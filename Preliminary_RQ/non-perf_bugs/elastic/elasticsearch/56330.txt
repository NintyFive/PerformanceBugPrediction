Also mixing the tool itself and the plugin in one jar is not a good design pattern.  \r\n\r\nAs I can see it, in our build we configure the `forbiddenApis` tasks directly and do not use the provided plugin extension at all. On option to fix the configuration time issue would be to wire these tasks per sourceSet ourselves in our own plugin. This will not fix the use of deprecated Gradle API in these task implementations.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"breskeby","id":77300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/77300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby","html_url":"https://github.com/breskeby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breskeby/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
