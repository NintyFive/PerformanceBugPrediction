To do that, we should remove calls to `tokenizer`, `charFilter`, and `tokenFilter` from the `_analyze` API, instead rebuilding these analyzers on the fly. This will make some calls to the `_analyze` API slower but it'll reduce the per index heap overhead.\n","closed_by":{"login":"johtani","id":1142449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDI0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1142449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani","html_url":"https://github.com/johtani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johtani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
