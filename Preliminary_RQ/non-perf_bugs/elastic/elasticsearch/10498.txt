As soon as #9203 is in the latter will only block data writes and metadata writes, meaning that metadata reads will be possible against a read_only index.\n\nIt might be beneficial to expose as setting the distinction between metadata read and write blocks made possible with #9203, as we do with data. The idea would be to deprecate the `index.blocks.metadata` and add `index.blocks.metadata_read` and `index.blocks.metadata_write`.\n\nOpening this up for discussion.\n","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
