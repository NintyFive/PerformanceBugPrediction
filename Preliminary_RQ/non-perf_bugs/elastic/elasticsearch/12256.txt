This is on a machine with 64GB of RAM. It was always defaulting to a 32 bit service, although no 32-bit service was installed on the machine. I traced the problem to be the fact that the default Java heap size with my JVM is 2GB. Here's the problem. The default memory limit for a PowerShell session is 1GB - so the JVM can't even start. But the service.bat file defaults to detecting a 32 bit JVM when in fact none exists. I'd like to add preferably two things - (1) a check to see that the JVM was able to initialize for the version check and (2) a reasonable heap maximum size for the check (-Xmx 2M) to avoid this type of problem.\n\nI know this is probably a real specific problem, but what thoughts do you guys have? I have made changes locally and the script works perfectly now, and am more than willing to submit a PR.\n","closed_by":{"login":"smflorentino","id":3495150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTUxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3495150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smflorentino","html_url":"https://github.com/smflorentino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smflorentino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smflorentino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smflorentino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smflorentino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smflorentino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smflorentino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smflorentino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smflorentino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smflorentino/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
