This is describing how to use a FilterBuilder not a QueryBuilder.  Here's the example using the FilterBuilder:\n\n``` java\nFilterBuilder fb = geoShapeFilter(\"location\", \n                                   ShapeBuilder.newEnvelope().topLeft(0,10).bottomRight(10,0), \n                                   ShapeRelation.WITHIN)\n```\n\nAt the moment GeoShapeQueryBuilder does not accept a relation (everything boils down to `CONTAINS` || `WITHIN` || `INTERSECTS`). This is primarily due to spatial query complexities in Lucene that haven't been cleaned up until recently. For the time being, to achieve more complex queries you can `match_all` and set a post filter, or you can combine a `geoShapeQuery` and post filter using the `geoShapeFilter`.  \n\nThere are a few low hanging fruit issues and optimizations here that I need to write up.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/162245368","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10271#issuecomment-162245368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10271","id":162245368,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjI0NTM2OA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-05T21:00:20Z","updated_at":"2015-12-05T21:00:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nknize can this be closed now?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/162321285","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10271#issuecomment-162321285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10271","id":162321285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjMyMTI4NQ==","user":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-06T14:35:47Z","updated_at":"2015-12-06T14:35:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"++.
