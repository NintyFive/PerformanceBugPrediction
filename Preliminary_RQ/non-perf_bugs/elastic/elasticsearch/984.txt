(`yes` being treated as true through the fallback \"any other value\" case)\nGenerally speaking, matching what is done in parsing JSON configuration/queries should be nice to have for two reasons (IMHO):\n- It makes it more consistent, even though document field values are distinct from ES internal understanding of JSON configuration\n- It is good to have multiple _english_ ways to express a false value, as they are very often used internally as values by many programmers (and therefore somehow sent to ES through JSON docs!)\n\nMaybe `F` would be good too, but for another reason: this is the term being used internally (and people may want to query using it...... ^^)\n\n  [1] http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/core-types.html\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
