This performs a search over all indices.\n\nThe logic of the MetaData.convertFromWildcards() method is as follows:\nFirst token is ba\\* - expand that into bar and baz and add them to the result set.\nSecond token is a negation of bar so it removes that.\nThird token is a negation of baz so it removes that to leave an empty set.\n\nThe problem is that an empty index set is also generated by http://example.com/_search.\n\nThere is later logic in PlainOperationRouting.computeTargetedShards() that treats the empty set as a request to search every index, including the index foo and the two indices that have been explicitly removed.\n\nThe proposed solution is:\n1. RestSearchAction.parseSearchRequest() to detect when request.param(\"index\") is null and to explicitly populate the indices array with \"_all\". Both /_all/_search and /_search then follow the exact same logical path - this may avoid future bugs.\n2. PlainOperationRouting.computeTargetedShards() should treat an empty concreteIndices array as a null search.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
