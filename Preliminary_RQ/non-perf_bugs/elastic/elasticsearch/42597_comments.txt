[Fielddata](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/fielddata.html) should only be possible and necesssary for text fields, if aggregations are required. For long fields you need to enable doc_values in 6.6.0. If you have further questions, please use our support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co. We prefer to use Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests, and we think it's more likely this is a question than a bug report. I'm closing this as an issue here, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum instead.
