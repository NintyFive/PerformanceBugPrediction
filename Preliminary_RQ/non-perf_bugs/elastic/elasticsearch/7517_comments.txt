We use AWS M3 instance types (ssd storage), where disk space is quite valuable. They are good disks not meant for storing huge data but for the IO disk operations, which is what Lucene needs.\nWe have a cluster with several nodes, and itÂ´s not good a good practice to go node by node deleting log files every time we have low disk space just because of the log files (not because of the index data). Also, as a good practice, we have to make sure that running out of space (due to log files) is not going to happen. So yes, we need that **MaxBackupIndex** available.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62126290","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7517#issuecomment-62126290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7517","id":62126290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTI2Mjkw","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-07T10:46:28Z","updated_at":"2014-11-07T10:46:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We don't plan to change the default appender used in Elasticsearch.
