I'm leaning towards creating the multi-field by default so that the out of the box experience is a good one: you get full text search AND analytics by default, without having to go back and reindex your data.\n\nChanging this default could be achieved very simply with a simple index template.\n\n> will aggregations still work on fields that do not use doc_values?\n\nBy default, no.  Fielddata loading is disabled by default to prevent unaware users from hurting themselves by eg mistakenly sorting on `foo`  instead of `foo.keyword`.  However, fielddata loading can be enabled dynamically on an existing field, which will then allow aggregations to be run as before.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/189321260","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12394#issuecomment-189321260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12394","id":189321260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTMyMTI2MA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-26T15:23:31Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T16:46:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Proposal:\n>    norms: true | false\n>    only supported on text fields\n\n@clintongormley  I started working on this but one issue I have is that the `boost` parameter implicitly enables norms.

I believe this is the right thing to do as it is much more common for an unaware user to sort/aggregate on the wrong field (full text instead of raw) and blow up their heap.

This is actually to do with whether field length norms are written for a not_analyzed field or not.

I would argue that enabling norms on keyword (not_analyzed) fields counts as spooky action at a distance.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
