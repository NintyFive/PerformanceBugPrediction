I do not follow what needs to be clarified. I am also not sure that our reference guide is the right place for in-depth examples like you mentioned, especially with docker. Maybe we should rather publish a blogpost or some other type of content.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/340781007","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27173#issuecomment-340781007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27173","id":340781007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDc4MTAwNw==","user":{"login":"nguyenlp","id":6330504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzA1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6330504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenlp","html_url":"https://github.com/nguyenlp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenlp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenlp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenlp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenlp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenlp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenlp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenlp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenlp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nguyenlp/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-31T14:33:29Z","updated_at":"2017-10-31T14:33:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @javanna , thanks for your inputs.  Yes a blog post with examples would be really helpful for users to reference.
