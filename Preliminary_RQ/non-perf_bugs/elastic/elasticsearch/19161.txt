This is going away in #19136 since most users of the ScriptService should not need to know or care about where the script comes from, it should be an impl detail of the ScriptService. The one place that needs this api is doing a search scroll. There, the QueryShardContext keeps the cluster state at the time the scroll was created. However, a simpler approach is to have the context keep any scripts it uses. This should be fairly simple as it appears from a cursory glance that anywhere in a search request that accesses a script peeks into the ScriptService of the query shard context. Instead, a wrapper method can be used that will cache the script in the context.\n","closed_by":{"login":"stu-elastic","id":24232742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjMyNzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24232742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic","html_url":"https://github.com/stu-elastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
