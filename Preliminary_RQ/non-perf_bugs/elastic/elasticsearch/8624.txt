What about `origin` and `scale`? It says that `origin` is set to the current time if it is not given, so it is optional as well I guess?\n\nWhat about `scale`? It does not blow up if not passed, so what value does it get by default? Is it also optional? :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"Linuus","id":379823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTgyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/379823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linuus","html_url":"https://github.com/Linuus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linuus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linuus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linuus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linuus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linuus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linuus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linuus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linuus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Linuus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
