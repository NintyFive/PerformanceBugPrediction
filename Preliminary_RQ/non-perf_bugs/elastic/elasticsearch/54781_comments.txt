Unfortunately that is exactly the right way to ask this kind of more general usage questions. This question is initially better suited to the support forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co since we want to keep using Github issues only for bug reports and feature requests only.\r\n\r\nReading your description above I think you might want to try adding a little more detail to you question like what your exact update request looks like, what your use-case is, maybe some index settings and mapping that apply to the field that are being updated and the way you issue these updates. All this will allow anybody reading your question to easier see if they know the answer or even to start digging further.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, I'm closing this issue here for above reasons, but encourage you to ask this question in the forum again.
