We've discussed this issue internally and have decided to open a new feature request to add a way to prefer nodes within the same availability zone. The feature in 7.x is based on the tags that are set in allocation awareness attributes and search requests only check for at least one attribute in common when performing the routing so it's easy to misconfigure it. \r\nSo instead of restoring the old functionality we'd like to discuss better ways to achieve the same without confusing users.\r\nI am closing this issue in favor of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60236 where we'll discuss actual implementations and ideas around this feature.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
