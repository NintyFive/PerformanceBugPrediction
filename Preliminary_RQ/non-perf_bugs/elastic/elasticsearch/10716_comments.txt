Your client can then look for the top N which have the same value. With https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10000 coming in 2.0 you could use the `max_bucket` aggregation to do this last step for you and return only the terms which have the maximum value.\n\nA similar approach could be used for the argmin.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/96259366","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10716#issuecomment-96259366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10716","id":96259366,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2MjU5MzY2","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-25T18:49:25Z","updated_at":"2015-04-25T18:49:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agree with @colings86 - going to close this\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
