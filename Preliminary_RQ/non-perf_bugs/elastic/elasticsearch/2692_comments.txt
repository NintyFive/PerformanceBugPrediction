This is indeed a bug. It manifests if you do the delete by query on a cluster without any indices. Yet, the fact that this works on the second try is that with delete by query you are only deleting all documents but not the index. So the index exists and the bug is not triggered. If you want to delete the index try `client.admin().indices(\"index_name\").prepareDelete().execute().actionGet();` <-- you can omit the name to del all indices but be careful!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/14351824","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2692#issuecomment-14351824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2692","id":14351824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzUxODI0","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-03T18:28:06Z","updated_at":"2013-03-03T18:28:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i also applied this to 0.20\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
