implementations of EQL have peg-based grammars, and as part of the design can't support chaining predicates.\r\n\r\nFor example, `1 == 1 == 1` raises a syntax error. This seems like good behavior, forcing the user to do `(1 == 1) == 1`.\r\n```console\r\n$ eql query 'any where 1 == 1 == 1'\r\nError at line:1,column:18\r\nInvalid syntax\r\nany where 1 == 1 == 1\r\n                 ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you get this\r\n```console\r\n$ eql query 'any where (1 == 1) == 1'\r\nError at line:1,column:11\r\nInvalid comparison of boolean to number\r\nany where (1 == 1) == 1\r\n          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, for Elasticsearch, we accept this syntax.
