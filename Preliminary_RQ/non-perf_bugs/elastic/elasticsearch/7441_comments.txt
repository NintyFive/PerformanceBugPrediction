But this would be a tricky/invasive change to Lucene's APIs...\n\nMaybe in the mean-time we should open up an [expert] setting in Elasticsearch to \"bias\" how the allowed RAM is divided?  It could be a linear weight, defaulting to 1, and we assign RAM in proportion to that weight divided by the sum of all weights for all shards on this node? \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/158663627","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7441#issuecomment-158663627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7441","id":158663627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODY2MzYyNw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-21T17:30:15Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T17:30:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing in favour of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/14121\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
