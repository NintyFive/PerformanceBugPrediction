I am interested in returning both the native ES score and my custom score.  I haven't found a way to append 2 scores to the returned document so I went with doing a multi-search with 2 queries, the first using the native score and the second doing the same query as the first, but using a rescore that calls my custom scoring function.  I set the size:10 in both queries and the window_size:10 in the rescore section.\n\nThe bug (or confusing thing) I see is that I do not get back the same documents for both queries.  Since I set the size to 10 and window to 10 and use the exact same query in both the queries I expected to get the exact same documents back, just with my custom score instead of the native ES score.  Indeed the documentation describes the rescore as \"executes a second query only on the Top-K results returned by the query and post_filter phases\" which, to me at least, says it should only execute the custom scoring on the first 10 results in the original query.\n\nSo is this behavior expected?  Is there a way to append a second score to the document in a native custom_scoring function (which would be all I need but not fix this if it is a bug)?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jostheim","id":132902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjkwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/132902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jostheim","html_url":"https://github.com/jostheim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jostheim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jostheim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jostheim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jostheim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jostheim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jostheim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jostheim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jostheim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jostheim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
