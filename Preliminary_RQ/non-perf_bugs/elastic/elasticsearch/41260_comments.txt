very much for your interest in Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nThe GenericAction class was combined into Action in 7.0. The fact something is still trying to load it means you have a class that was compiled for an older version of elasticsearch being loaded. I recommend you try completely removing elasticsearch and installing fresh, including plugins.\r\n\r\nFor future issues like this we'd like to first direct these kinds of things to the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co). If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/486952070","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41260#issuecomment-486952070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41260","id":486952070,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4Njk1MjA3MA==","user":{"login":"LuomingXu","id":24503603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTAzNjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24503603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuomingXu","html_url":"https://github.com/LuomingXu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuomingXu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuomingXu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuomingXu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuomingXu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuomingXu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuomingXu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuomingXu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuomingXu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuomingXu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T07:11:07Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T07:11:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rjernst  okay~","performed_via_github_app":null}]
