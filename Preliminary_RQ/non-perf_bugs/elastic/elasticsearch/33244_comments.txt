In this case  the users just click a partcular GET or POST , it shows the short info about what it does , the parameters it takes , the possible response codes and an option to try it out where user plugin the values if needed and click execute , under the hood it makes the query and posts it to the RESt service. \r\n\r\nScreen shots attached from the Docker UCP live API. \r\n\r\n![screenshot

provides that , by listing those GET and POSTs for each resource and a **try it out** option , where it provides a text box for the optional and required fields so that users don't have to type the whole query. \r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nFor example if user wants to re-index one index into another using the reindex API , there should be a POST entry in live API for that , that takes source index and destination index as required options and present the other options as optional ,  when user fills in those values and click execute , it should format the whole REST request along with query and submit it to elastic API and print the respose code/json etc.\r\n\r\n**Note:**  Acutally Its a live documentation for the REST API so that users dont have to search online the documentation and avoid doing copy pasting into the dev tools each time.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/417312702","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33244#issuecomment-417312702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33244","id":417312702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzMxMjcwMg==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-30T13:07:08Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T13:07:08Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging
