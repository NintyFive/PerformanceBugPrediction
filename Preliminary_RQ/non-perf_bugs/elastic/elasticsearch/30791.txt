It would be as useful (if not essential) for integrations like ours to benefit from minimal dependencies as well for the Builder classes.\r\n\r\nA similar, related extraction was [completed recently for XContent](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/libs/x-content): #28504. How about considering doing the same for Builder classes in packages such as index.query, action.support, search.builder and maybe more? Those classes work closely with XContentBuilder thus could benefit from a similar extraction treatment.\r\n\r\nOf course, the sibling high-level API aims at a similar purpose, but with more dependencies which conflict with libraries that are already integrated. That approach also prevents a system embedding an Elasticsearch client from supporting multiple Elasticsearch server versions.","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
