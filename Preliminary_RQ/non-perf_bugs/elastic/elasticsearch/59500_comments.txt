That's why, even if it may come in the future, it has not been scheduled yet.\r\n\r\nFrom a security perspective, I'd expect password changes to be performed via tools (like Kibana), where there is no support for `password_hash` and it could not be used anyway. Adding support in other tools is an option, but it requires even additional effort.\r\n\r\nFrom a performance perspective, bulk creation of users via config management tools (e.g. during initial setup) is a pretty common scenario, while massive password changes are probably not.
