If you can stop\r\nby there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified\r\nbug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. I'd also recommend\r\nproviding more information on your index/shard layout, information about \r\nthe load of the cluster (what kind of operations were taking place, inserts, \r\nqueries, what types of queries) around the time you encountered the \r\n`OutOfMemoryError` and, if possible, a memory dump (if it happens again).\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/)\r\nthat should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I\r\nhope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
