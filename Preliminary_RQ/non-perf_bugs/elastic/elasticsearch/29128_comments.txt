If you sort chronologically, newest-first, by a date field, documents with the same date will probably be sorted incorrectly (because they match). This is often reported by users seeing events \"out of order\" when they have the same timestamp. Specific example being sorting by date and seeing events in newest-first order, unless there is a tie, in which case oldest-first (or first-written?) appears. This causes a bit of confusion for the ELK use case.\r\n\r\nIsn't what you reported?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
