Although, we agree that this behavior can be confusing, which is why we've decided to deprecate it in 6.x and to make the breaking change in `7.x`: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/35354\r\nYou should have a deprecation warning associated with the response in 6.8, that's how we warn users that a breaking change will occur in the next major version.\r\nFor these reasons, I hope you don't mind if I close the issue since you consider the new behavior as the right thing to do.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
