The breaking changes doc mentions: \r\n\r\n> Instead of these removed parameters, use their non camel case equivalents without starting underscore, e.g. use version_type instead of _version_type or versionType.\r\n\r\nThe `or` there applies to the latter argument, so it's \r\n```\r\n   use version_type instead of ( _version_type or versionType ) \r\n```\r\nand not \r\n```\r\n   (use version_type instead of _version_type) or versionType.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince in the same document, a few lines above, we do mention that camel case parameters ( and we use `versionType` as example)  and all parameters starting with underscore are removed, I believe that the message is conveyed clearly.
