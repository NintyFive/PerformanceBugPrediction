This is viewable in your example with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/ # tar tvf elasticsearch-6.8.5.tar.gz --numeric-owner | head -n 2\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 631/503           0 2019-11-14 14:20 ./\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 631/503           0 2019-11-13 20:07 ./elasticsearch-6.8.5/\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo extract the 6.8.5 artifact to the location you want you can use `--strip-components=2`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/ # tar zxvf elasticsearch-6.8.5.tar.gz --strip-components=2 -C elastic\r\n```\r\n\r\nFuture releases will switch back to not including `./`, so it might be good to prepare the script to handle both cases, something like this should do the trick:\r\n```\r\n$ if tar tf elasticsearch-6.8.5.tar.gz | head -n 1 | grep -q '^./$'; then STRIP_COMPONENTS_COUNT=2; else STRIP_COMPONENTS_COUNT=1; fi\r\n$ tar zxvf elasticsearch-6.8.5.tar.gz --strip-components=$STRIP_COMPONENTS_COUNT -C elastic\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/557372161","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49417#issuecomment-557372161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49417","id":557372161,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzM3MjE2MQ==","user":{"login":"csandanov","id":1058233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgyMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1058233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csandanov","html_url":"https://github.com/csandanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csandanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csandanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csandanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csandanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csandanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csandanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csandanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csandanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csandanov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-22T03:27:29Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T03:27:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you, that helped!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
