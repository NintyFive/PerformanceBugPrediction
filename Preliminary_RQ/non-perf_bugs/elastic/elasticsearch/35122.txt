It is the responsibility of `nullSafeFilter()` which wraps the whole filter to transform the `null` to false.\r\n\r\nCurrently the generation of the painless script skips the null values so it will not evaluate to `null` but directly to false. This can be problematic if the `IN` expression is nested under an `AND` or `OR` expression which requires the `null` to be returned in order to correctly evaluate itself using the 3-valued logic.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
