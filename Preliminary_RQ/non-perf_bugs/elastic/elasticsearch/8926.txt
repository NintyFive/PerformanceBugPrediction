But it breaks when there are too many terms and the output \ninformation is larger than about 30-40 megabytes. I need my custom plugin to work for bigger amounts of output data.\n\n   I am thinking about creating a custom plugin to return hashes of terms instead of the actual terms to reduce the output data volume.\n\n  So I have a couple of questions:\n1. I presume that Elasticsearch might already use hashes of terms internally in the index, so would it be possible to get those?\n2. If the above is not possible, what other options do I have to circumvent the 30-40 MB barrier?\n\n   Thank you in advance.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Rosen78","id":10164207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTY0MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10164207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rosen78","html_url":"https://github.com/Rosen78","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rosen78/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rosen78/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rosen78/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rosen78/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rosen78/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rosen78/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rosen78/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rosen78/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rosen78/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
