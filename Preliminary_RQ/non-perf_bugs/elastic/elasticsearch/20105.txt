Create an index in elasticsearch\n2. Close that index\n3. Attempt to access it via HTTP (`http://<host>:<port>/closed_index/_search?ignore_unavailable`). The request will be successful.\n4. Attempt to access it via the Java API (setting the unavailable ignore flag using `IndicesOptions.fromOptions(true, true, true, false)` or `IndicesOptions.lenientExpandOpen()`). The request will fail with a `[FORBIDDEN/4/index closed]`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
