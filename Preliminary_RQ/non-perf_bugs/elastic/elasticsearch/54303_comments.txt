remember debugging this a long while ago. I handed this off to someone else that was able to get things working on their machine instead of mine as a proof of concept so I never got back to this thread. Thank you for getting back to me. I don't think I would be able to reproduce the error because I don't use that machine anymore. This probably works just fine through something like the ElasticCloud service which is where I would leverage a tool like this anyway.\r\nFeel free to close this issue however you see fit.
