It would be ideal if those settings were configurable.\n\nFor example, the default configuration includes a history that looks at the last 256 filters.  In the extreme case, if you had a stream of fairly complicated filters where the total number of distinct filters was significantly greater than 256, then you'd never get caching of any filters!\n\nIn a real world example, we just went through an upgrade from ES 1.7 to 2.1.1 and experienced pretty severe degradation of response times.  Analysis of the query_cache indicated that a) the cache was relatively sparsely populated; b) the miss ratio was very high.  Our particular use case was not well handled b/c we filter documents using arbitrary boolean combinations of ~1k terms.  As best as I could tell, the limited 256 history size meant that we were only caching the very most common terms.  Inefficient caching combined with a fairly large document count led to increased response times across the board and very painful response times under heavier load. \n\nTellingly, what rescued performance was completely bypassing the usage-based cache via the undocumented `index.queries.cache.everything: true` setting and relying purely on the LRU-nature of the cache to keep the most useful filters around.\n\nTuning the usage policy would be great.  And, arguably, documented support of a policy that simply relies on using LRU to determine the useful filters would also be a good idea.  (It did not escape my attention that the `index.queries.cache.everything` setting appears to have only been added for testing purposes!)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
