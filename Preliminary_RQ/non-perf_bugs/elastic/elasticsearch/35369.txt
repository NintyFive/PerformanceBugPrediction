Having a string as `_id` for something near 2.000.000.000 documents and using search_after request to scroll fair amounts of documents, if I am correct, my fielddata cache did fill up with data necessary to apply the sort on my documents. To get around this problem, I just went back to sorting on integer properties (that I use to build the `_id` property...).\r\n\r\nTo me, recommending to use the `_id` property without warning against potential issues using it seems to be problematic: **should the documentation be updated to add more specific information about this case ?**\r\n\r\nIf I am not mistaken, the recommendation is only valid if using a generated `_id`, or an integer.\r\nAlso, those two documentation page seem to be conflicting:\r\n - https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/docs/reference/search/request/search-after.asciidoc\r\n - https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/docs/reference/mapping/fields/id-field.asciidoc\r\n\r\nOne says that using `_id` for aggregations and sorting is not recommended, the other recommends using `_id` as part of the sort tiebreaker for search_after requests.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
