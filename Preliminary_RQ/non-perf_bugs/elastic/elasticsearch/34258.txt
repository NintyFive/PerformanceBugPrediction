Reusing the same index uuid is not a problem for following an index in a different index, but it is for following an index in the same index.\r\n* There are several code paths that only get executed when following a local index.\r\n* In order to avoid cyclic auto follow explosion, logic was added to not auto follow leader indices that have custom ccr metadata in IndexMetaData for local auto follow patterns.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to just disallow following indices in the same cluster and then in tests we setup two clusters. The tests that need to be changed are `ShardChangesIT` and `AutoFollowTests`.","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
