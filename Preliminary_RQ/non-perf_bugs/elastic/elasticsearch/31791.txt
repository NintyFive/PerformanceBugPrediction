Inside the object `\"indices\" : {` all indices are listed with its names. The data that is missing inside is the index uuid. It can be fetched by calling `GET /index-name` and then can be found under `uuid`. Having to make a separate request for each index to fetch the identifier is not an optimal solution.\r\n\r\nThe uuid is important for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* The same index name can exist in multiple clusters. Beats can collect data from multiple clusters into a single monitoring cluster.\r\n* An index can be deleted and a new one created with the same name. In this case only the UUID is different.\r\n* With cross cluster replication matching indices from 2 different clusters with the same uuid could become even more interesting: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/30086\r\n\r\nNOTE: The _stats endpoint also currently does not expose the `cluster_uuid` and we fetch it in a separate call.","closed_by":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
