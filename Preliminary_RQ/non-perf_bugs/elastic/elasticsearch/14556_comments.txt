On the one hand this is a nice usecase for response filtering (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/14390) but it would still have `_source : {}` in the response. On the other hand having dedicated REST handlers is not nice either so I wonder if we can implement this as a general feature on GET and push the real rendering in to `GetResponse#toXContent()` and pass a boolean via the `Params` if we only want the source or skip metadata? We can then also deprecate the `/_source` Url and just use a param instead.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/374606611","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14556#issuecomment-374606611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14556","id":374606611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDYwNjYxMQ==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T13:56:20Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T13:56:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This feature request is an interesting idea but since its opening we have\r\nnot seen enough feedback that it is a feature we should pursue.
