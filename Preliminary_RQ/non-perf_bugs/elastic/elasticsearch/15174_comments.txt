I haven't tried with the `ik` analyzer as it is not supported by Elasticsearch.  I suggest trying to recreate without the `ik` analyzer.  If you can do that, then reopen this issue here, otherwise open an issue on https://github.com/medcl/elasticsearch-analysis-ik\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
