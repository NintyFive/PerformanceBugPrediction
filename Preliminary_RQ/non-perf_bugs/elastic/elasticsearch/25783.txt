I feel that for some they'll be scratching their head when they can't figure out why elasticsearch isn't booting up on OSX :)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nuncaught exception in thread [main] org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.StartupException: org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.BootstrapException: java.nio.file.FileSystemException: /SOME_DIR/elasticsearch-5.5.0/plugins/.DS_Store/plugin-descriptor.properties: Not a directory\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
