What is the advantage of writing yaml tests over Java tests? Yaml tests were created so that they could be run from the the different language clients. Are we adding yaml tests that the language clients won't ever run? What has changed compared to the initial goal of the yaml suite?\r\n\r\nI think the answers to these would help clarifying if we should add more assertions to the yaml tests, or rather go with Java tests for these cases.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/350273341","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27699#issuecomment-350273341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27699","id":350273341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDI3MzM0MQ==","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-08T14:17:09Z","updated_at":"2017-12-08T14:17:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We talked about this, and it makes sense to keep using `ESRestTestCase` in such cases, as they are much more likely feature tests and should not run when the client test things. The correct way would be to make sure all the APIs are supported in the high level rest client and use that one inside of `ESRestTestCase`","performed_via_github_app":null}]
