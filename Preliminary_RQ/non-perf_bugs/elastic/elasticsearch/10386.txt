A possible solution is to use the filter param:\n\nGET /sample/document/_search\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"value_facet\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"field\": \"value_id\",\n        \"include\": \"a|b\"\n      }}}}\n\nI think a better way would be, to use a value param, like this:\n\nGET /sample/document/_search\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"value_facet\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"field\": \"value_id\",\n        \"values\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n      }}}}\n\nto restrict the values. Can this be implemented or is there another possibility to implemented this?\n\nGreetings,\nMartin\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
