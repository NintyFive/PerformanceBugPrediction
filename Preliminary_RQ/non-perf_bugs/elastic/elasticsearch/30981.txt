It is always necessary while [creating an `ExplainResponse` object](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/explain/ExplainResponse.java#L48-L63) and also [transfered during serialization](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/explain/ExplainResponse.java#L118), but it's not in the rest response.\r\n\r\nIn explain's rest response, we have put the [`matched`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/rest/action/search/RestExplainAction.java#L99) field which is derived from lucene's explanation object, briefly to say if there is a match for the passed query.\r\n\r\nSo as a consuquence, we are not able to re-create the `ExplainResponse` in rest high level client because the `exists` field doesn't exist in low level rest results. So do we initially want to put `exists` instead of `matched` in rest response ? Or we need to add `exists` field in response before `matched` for example ?\r\n\r\nCC @javanna am I missing anything ? do you have an idea on it ?","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
