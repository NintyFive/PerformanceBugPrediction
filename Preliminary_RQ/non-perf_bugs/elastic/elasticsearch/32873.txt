JVM fails to overwrite the heap file with following error (if say the JVM option `-XX:HeapDumpPath=.\\heapdump.hprof` was used):\r\n```\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\nDumping heap to .\\heapdump.hprof ...\r\nUnable to create .\\heapdump.hprof: File exists\r\n```\r\nAs a result, only the first heap dump file will be created. No heap dump file will be created subsequently as the file would already exist.
