However, numeric data differs a bit from string data in that values are usually more useful (and not much larger) than ordinals and sorted-set is quite slow at getting the values from a doc ID (because of the levels of indirection and that getting the values will require random disk I/O).\n\nSo I was thinking that it would probably a better trade-off to store numeric values in a binary doc values field. Since all per-doc values would be stored sequentially on disk, we wouldn't have the random I/O issue anymore.\n\nThe two main challenges if we go this way would be to allow a field mapper to buffer all field values before creating a single Lucene field instance, and to pick a space and CPU efficient encoding for multi-valued numeric fields.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
