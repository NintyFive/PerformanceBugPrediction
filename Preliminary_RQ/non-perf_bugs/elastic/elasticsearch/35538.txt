There are currently only a couple third party offerings that are not anywhere near ready for production.\r\n\r\nRust has been voted the most loved programming language for the last three consecutive years on StackOverflow, and with companies beginning to move to its use in production, it would fit a pretty big hole in the Rust ecosystem to have an official ES client and allow developers to begin integrating with Elasticsearch from the start.","closed_by":{"login":"philkra","id":35487337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDg3MzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35487337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philkra","html_url":"https://github.com/philkra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philkra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philkra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philkra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philkra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philkra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philkra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philkra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philkra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philkra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
