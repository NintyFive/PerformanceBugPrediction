I saw [this PR](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/11077), thinking it might be related?\n\nIs there another way to achieve the highlighting in newer versions? I've tried indexing with term vectors for `text` and that works for all ES versions, but I don't want to do that, since I'd rather keep the returned results in highlight on a sentence level to be easier to understand the context, so `postings` highlighting is the best choice for me. Plus it takes less space. Any recommendations to achieve highlighting, or am I doing sth wrong?
