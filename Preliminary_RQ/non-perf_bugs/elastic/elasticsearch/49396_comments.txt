Upgrading Elasticsearch from Netty 4.1.32 would involve non-trivial behavioral changes. We found it difficult to assess the risk that these changes would pose to 6.8 stability. However, we came to the conclusion that it was dangerous to make these larger changes. \r\n\r\nAdditionally we evaluated the security risk posed by not upgrading Netty. Our understanding of this issue is that the security risk is low. The problem would arise when Elasticsearch is combined with a piece of middleware that sends different user requests over a persistent connection. This combination is difficult to exploit and can be mitigated when required on the middleware / proxy side.\r\n\r\n@jasontedor @ywelsch @tomcallahan ","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/582997107","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49396#issuecomment-582997107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49396","id":582997107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Mjk5NzEwNw==","user":{"login":"seang-es","id":6352850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTI4NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6352850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es","html_url":"https://github.com/seang-es","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-06T16:46:29Z","updated_at":"2020-02-06T16:46:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tbrooks8 Thanks, does this apply to only the 6.8.x branch, with 7.x and 8.0 being updated to Netty 4.1.45?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/583002152","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49396#issuecomment-583002152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49396","id":583002152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzAwMjE1Mg==","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-06T16:54:45Z","updated_at":"2020-02-06T16:54:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yes, this upgrade limitation only applies to 6.8.
