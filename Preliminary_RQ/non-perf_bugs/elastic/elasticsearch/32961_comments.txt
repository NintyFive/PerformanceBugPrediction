So we do not have the information necessary to upgrade them (nor would this work in the non-packaged case of zip/tar). The need to manually upgrade plugins is mentioned in [upgrade documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rolling-upgrades.html) (see step 6). Since there is nothing we can do about this, I'm going to close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
