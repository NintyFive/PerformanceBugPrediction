discussion some more investigation we came up with the following:\r\n\r\n- WEEK interval is not supported by standard SQL\r\n- Handling it with java.time is also tricky\r\n- WEEK interval can lead to problematic semantics:\r\n  - Is 7 DAYS interval equivalent of 1 WEEK? (and 14 DAYS 2 WEEKS and so on)\r\n  - When does a WEEK start? Monday? Sunday? Do we have to introduce 2 different intervals? Do we need to add locale in the SQL query params (currently not supported) so it's taken from there?\r\n\r\nTherefore, since we don't have any substantial demand for this feature, we'll go ahead and close this issue and revisit it in the future if we receive user requests to have it implemented.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
