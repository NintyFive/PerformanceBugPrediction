It all boils down to how delete index works internally. One cluster state update per index gets processed by `TransportDeleteIndexAction`, which tends to \"forget\" about previous indices failures. If the last delete index task succeeds, a positive response is returned, whereas if the last delete index task fails (or times out), then a failure is returned.
