Excluding the upper bound is intentional, and is designed to make it easier to create ranges with the minimum of arithmetic.  You just need to add your chosen interval (eg 1 month) to the `from` value in each range, eg:\n\n```\nfrom:            to:\n2014-01-18      2014-02-18\n2014-02-18      2014-03-18\n2014-03-18      2014-04-18\n```\n\ninstead of having to also manipulate the `to` value:\n\n```\nfrom:            to (inclusive):\n2014-01-18      2014-02-17\n2014-02-18      2014-03-17\n2014-03-18      2014-04-17\n```\n\nThis seems easier to me, especially when an inclusive range also has to deal with date rounding, eg do you mean `2014-04-17 00:00:00` or `2014-04-17 23:59:59.9999`?\n\nDo you still think that inclusive upper bounds are a good idea?\n\nBack in the day of facets, I remember that providing different comparators (eg `gt`, `gte` etc) was problematic for some reason.  Not sure if the same limitation applies to aggs.
