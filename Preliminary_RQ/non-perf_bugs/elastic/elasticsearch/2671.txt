This has come up for me in a project where one of the fields is essentially a dynamic enumeration of about five thousand entries; names of people and companies and the like. The Cleo project is available under Apache 2.0, should ES authors see fit to borrow any of its components to fulfill this feature request. ES already has its own Bloom implementation.\n\nAn auto-complete search request would allow me to say field X must equal \"Z\" and field \"Y\" is the field which I'm running the auto-complete request on.\n\nExample record: { assigned_rep: \"Bob\", company: \"Tractor mowing\", company_tokens: [\"tractor\",\"mowing\",\"lawn\"] }.\n\nMy search index would be on assigned_rep and company_tokens. I would pass assigned_rep = Bob and autocomplete_search on company_tokens for \"Law\", which would match on \"lawn\" and return the full record (and any other matches).\n","closed_by":{"login":"Downchuck","id":141466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTQ2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/141466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downchuck","html_url":"https://github.com/Downchuck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downchuck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downchuck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downchuck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downchuck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downchuck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downchuck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downchuck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downchuck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Downchuck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
