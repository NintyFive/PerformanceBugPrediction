This suggests that there might be issues with the classpath. I assume that you are running Elasticsearch standalone and not embedded in some other application. I'd also do a review of the defined environment variables (`env`) for the user that is executing the elasticsearch process and check the contents of `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext`.\r\n\r\nYou could also raise the log level of the root logger to `DEBUG` by changing the line with root logger in `config/elasticsearch.yml` to `rootLogger.level = debug`. It's less impact to start with setting the [slow log](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-slowlog.html) threshold to zero by [setting the following index-level setting](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-update-settings.html):\r\n\r\n```\r\nindex.search.slowlog.threshold.query.info: 0s\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy doing the latter you will get a list of all queries that are run but you need to do this per index.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also doubt that this is related to the query (I tried to reproduce it on 5.4.3 with JDK 1.8.0_141 with our [scripted metric aggregation example](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-metrics-scripted-metric-aggregation.html)) but maybe it's revealing something.\r\n\r\nAs the problem is not reproducible (neither by me nor by you) I am closing this for now. I hope that I've given you enough pointers to help you to narrow it down. If you found a way to reproduce this issue with the pointers I've given here, please feel free to reopen.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
