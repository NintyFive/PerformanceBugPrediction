We have thought about this quite hard in the last few weeks and have come to the conclusion to change our stance here on not declaring a Java dependency. It will take for us some time to investigate a solution that works for all the distributions that we support, and we are unlikely to make a change like this in a minor release but we intend to have this solved before our next major release. The solution that we are looking for will have two aims:\r\n> \r\n> * a simple `<package manager> install elasticsearch` should install a version of Java that we support\r\n> * there is an out for experienced/opinionated users to `<package manager> install elasticsearch` without it installing a version of Java that they do not want (e.g., users that want and only want an Oracle-distributed JDK) (we will probably via an `alternatives`-mechanism; again, we need to investigate what is possible on all the distributions that we support)\r\n> \r\n> We will also aim to clarify the documentation and to make the error that occurs when you `<package manager> install elasticsearch` in 6.x without a JDK being installed less obtuse.\r\n> \r\n> Again, thank you so much  for the feedback and thank you for your patience.
