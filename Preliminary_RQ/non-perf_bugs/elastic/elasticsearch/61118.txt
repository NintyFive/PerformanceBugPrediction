But make it part of the payload so the value will be available in all aspect of debugging.\r\nX-Opaque-ID only shows up for slow logs, which is not friendly enough IMO.\r\nI often use kibana to see detailed task and any query taking too long will be spotted easily.  Especially performance degradation over time.\r\nThe problem for me is that I have no idea who made that request and under what context.  The coders don't even know most of the time.\r\n\r\nIf there's a boolean flag that allows us to return the comment from request payload, then I can easily use comment as an ID.\r\nIt will speed up troubleshooting significantly.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
