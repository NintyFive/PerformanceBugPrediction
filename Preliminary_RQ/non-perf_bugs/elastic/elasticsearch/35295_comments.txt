For whatever reason, a job has a bulk in-flight (despite the test being over), so it acknowledges the stop but stays in `STOPPING` because it's waiting for the indexer to finish it's async request\r\n5. stop request times out (10s) and fails the test because the job couldn't be cleaned up, cascades to fail a few more tests that run right after\r\n6. Bulk finally times out with an error because the index was deleted\r\n7. Job logs the bulk error, notices the stop request and finally shuts itself down (well after the test has finished)\r\n\r\nNeed to determine why the indexer is allowed to continue running even after a test \"passes\" (e.g. everything should be done and static at the end of the test), and perhaps alter the order of events for clean up (remove all jobs before deleting all indices)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/465634324","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/35295#issuecomment-465634324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/35295","id":465634324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTYzNDMyNA==","user":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T15:49:49Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T15:49:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Note: the fix was merged into master, but backports are still pending.
