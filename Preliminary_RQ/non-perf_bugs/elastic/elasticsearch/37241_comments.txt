is expected, you should use the `index_prefixes` option in the mapping to ensure that prefixes are indexed, you can also use a different rewrite method for your prefix query. The limit was added to prevent wild expansion that can exhaust the memory on the node. Considering that this limit is documented and that you can workaround the issue I hope you don't mind that I close this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
