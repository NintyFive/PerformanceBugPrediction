javascript\n{\"error\":\"ElasticSearchIllegalStateException[restart is disabled (for now) ....]\",\"status\":500}\n```\n\nDoes it mean that we can only use it with the service wrapper?\nI'm on the way of creating the pull request to update the documentation so I need to understand if it's a windows restriction, a configuration restriction (but I can't see an option in the `elasticsearch.yml` file,
