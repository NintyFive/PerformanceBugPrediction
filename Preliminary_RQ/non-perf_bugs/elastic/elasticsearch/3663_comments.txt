As you have a different `data.path` this setting does not apply.\n- You should not use NFS at all, when working with elasticsearch. Your search and indexing performance will be dramatically slower. Also native locking is not supported on NFS. You might want to read this thread for further information: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Lucene-index-on-NFS-td4011301.html\n- You should especially make sure, that data directories are not written by two separate process, no matter if these process are on one machine or because your network storage are on a cluster.\n\nHope this helps (and ensures having a fast and reliable search engine up and running).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/25075460","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3663#issuecomment-25075460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3663","id":25075460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDc1NDYw","user":{"login":"anandnalya","id":66878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/66878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandnalya","html_url":"https://github.com/anandnalya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandnalya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandnalya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandnalya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandnalya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandnalya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandnalya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandnalya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandnalya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandnalya/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-25T10:19:00Z","updated_at":"2013-09-25T10:19:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"HI,\n\nI wanted to know if there are any other complications of using ES over NFS apart from the lucene gotchas.\n\nThanks,\nAnand\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/71429043","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3663#issuecomment-71429043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3663","id":71429043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDI5MDQz","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-26T08:45:39Z","updated_at":"2015-01-26T08:45:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think this should be solved with the improvement to Zen Discovery we made in 1.4.
