Tim. I did search for \"elasticsearch document level security terms lookup\" and got nothing back in the first 2 pages. So it seems most of the limitation are actually documented. The only missing one is just datemath with \"now\" and it can be easily added alongside the existing ones.\r\n\r\nAs for the location, I'd suggest at least add a cross-link to the [document level security doc page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/document-level-security.html) to reference the page you linked. And revise the statement of it \"supports the full Elasticsearch Query DSL\".","performed_via_github_app":null}]
