This just uses Codec.getDefault() for the raw unfiltered lucene default codec, which is randomized by LuceneTestCase.\n\nSome tests rely on the custom postings format in ES (the completion suggester tests and rest tests), and a few other tests wire the lucene default codec, but these can all be simplified to just use `SuppressCodecs(\"*\")`. \n\nOtherwise, i think let LuceneTestCase do it, it will only find bugs because of things like AssertingCodec that we have.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/94301453","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5830#issuecomment-94301453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5830","id":94301453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0MzAxNDUz","user":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-19T17:57:33Z","updated_at":"2015-04-19T17:57:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I hooked this in here: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/b09d236fc0bf2763dd69140e4b7f5fa0cc22a48b\n\nFor now we just use AssertingCodec: it found several bugs immediately: #10660, #10661.
