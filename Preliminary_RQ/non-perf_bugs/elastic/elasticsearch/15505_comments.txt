We were discussing it today as a team and I feel there's a possibility it's related to some ongoing work we've been doing, but I don't want to presume so much about your use case.  I realize it's been a while, but curious if you're still around and if we could hear more about what you're thinking of in terms of operations here.  For example, for your use case are you concerned mostly with search or also with indexing operations?  Are there other operations that you're also considering?  And are you sensitive to performance of the close/open index rotation?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/413689295","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15505#issuecomment-413689295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15505","id":413689295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzY4OTI5NQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-16T21:24:20Z","updated_at":"2018-08-16T21:24:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"And are you sensitive to the search performance on such indices?

And most urgent search traffic is not very high since it is only visited when exceptions happen. other regular search and statistic query will be left to off peak time.\r\nquestion:Would it be acceptable if when these indices are searched, the performance is degraded.\r\n answer: yes, from 1 seconds to 5/6 seconds is acceptable","performed_via_github_app":null}]
