In the past we've seen issue with `DEFINE` command which might ignore the given configuration - in other words, while you do `EsStorage` to point to `'es.nodes = 68.67.141.63` Pig might disregard that and use the default parameter, namely the `localhost`.\nYou can double check this in several ways:\n1. make sure there's no cluster on your localhost. If you are running the Pig script against a remote cluster, double check your elasticsearch ip.\n2. turn on logging (see the docs) to double check to what IP/node the connection is made to\n3. Make sure you are looking at the right cluster when checking the mapping.\n\nI'm closing the issue for now - if you still have issues, please open a new one in the es-hadoop project.\n\nThanks,\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/86630299","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10245#issuecomment-86630299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10245","id":86630299,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NjMwMjk5","user":{"login":"BalachanderGS","id":10089328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDg5MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10089328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalachanderGS","html_url":"https://github.com/BalachanderGS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalachanderGS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalachanderGS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalachanderGS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalachanderGS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalachanderGS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalachanderGS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalachanderGS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalachanderGS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalachanderGS/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-26T17:18:23Z","updated_at":"2015-03-26T17:18:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think it is going to the write IP as I am able to see the indexing through Marvel (on the desired cluster).
