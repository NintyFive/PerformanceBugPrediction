One problem they present is that we don't have a clear specification in advance of upgrading to 5.x which bootstrap checks are going to happen and what will cause a cluster to fail to start.\r\n\r\nEvery bootstrap check is [documented](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.2/bootstrap-checks.html).\r\n\r\n> Things that were allowed in 2.x are no longer permitted, and the process of working through each bootstrap issue and restarting to find the next issue.\r\n\r\nWe print every failing bootstrap check on startup, it is not necessary to go through them one-by-one.\r\n\r\n> It would help users plan for upgrades if we had a utility that would run the same set of bootstrap checks that 5.x uses on startup in order to verify whether a node is compliant.\r\n\r\nThis can be done by starting the node (for example, in a QA environment) in the expected configuration.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/282879459","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23394#issuecomment-282879459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23394","id":282879459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Mjg3OTQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"seang-es","id":6352850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTI4NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6352850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es","html_url":"https://github.com/seang-es","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-27T22:35:48Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T22:35:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The
