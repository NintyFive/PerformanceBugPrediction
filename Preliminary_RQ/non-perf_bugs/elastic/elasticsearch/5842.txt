Any indented lines after an unindented line will be treated as children of the unindented line, and all of those lines will not parse correctly.\n\nThe sample config comments in elasticsearch.yml and logging.yml include space characters after the '#' character at the beginning of the lines.  This encourages users to uncomment them by removing the '#' character without touching the space.  This can lead to trouble if users later add other config keys without including the space.  It would be better if the space characters were removed.\n","closed_by":{"login":"seang-es","id":6352850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTI4NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6352850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es","html_url":"https://github.com/seang-es","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seang-es/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
