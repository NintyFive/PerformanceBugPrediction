The issue description is a bit confusion, but here are the steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Generate access/refresh token pair with a short lifetime (used `15s` in my tests)\r\n2. Wait till access token expires\r\n3. Simultaneously send two refresh token requests\r\n4. When first request completes try to use newly refresh token within a request to `_authenticate` endpoint\r\n\r\nIt happens so that at the step `4.` first refresh request is still in progress and request to `_authenticate` with newly refreshed token at the same time fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n> HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized  (application/json)\r\n> WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"security\"\r\n> WWW-Authenticate: ApiKey\r\n> WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"security\" charset=\"UTF-8\"\r\n\r\n> {\"error\":{\"root_cause\":[{\"type\":\"security_exception\",\"reason\":\"missing authentication credentials for REST request [/_security/_authenticate]\",\"header\":{\"WWW-Authenticate\":[\"Bearer realm=\\\"security\\\"\",\"ApiKey\",\"Basic realm=\\\"security\\\" charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\"\"]}}],\"type\":\"security_exception\",\"reason\":\"missing authentication credentials for REST request [/_security/_authenticate]\",\"header\":{\"WWW-Authenticate\":[\"Bearer realm=\\\"security\\\"\",\"ApiKey\",\"Basic realm=\\\"security\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n/cc @jkakavas ","closed_by":{"login":"jkakavas","id":10281256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgxMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/10281256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas","html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
