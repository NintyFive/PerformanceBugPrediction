See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-shape.html:\r\n\r\n> IMPORTANT NOTE: WKT does not enforce a specific order for vertices thus ambiguous polygons around the dateline and poles are possible. GeoJSON mandates that the outer polygon must be counterclockwise and interior shapes must be clockwise, which agrees with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Simple Feature Access specification for vertex ordering.\r\n\r\n> Elasticsearch accepts both clockwise and counterclockwise polygons if they appear not to cross the dateline (i.e. they cross less than 180° of longitude), but for polygons that do cross the dateline (or for other polygons wider than 180°) Elasticsearch requires the vertex ordering to comply with the OGC and GeoJSON specifications. Otherwise, an unintended polygon may be created and unexpected query/filter results will be returned.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
