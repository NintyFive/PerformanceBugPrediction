That PR adjusts quite a lot of the docs, and there were a few followup PRs to deal with things it missed which did not all get backported all the way to 6.2. The case you highlight was fixed in #29667 (i.e. 6.4.0). Would you be interested in back porting that to 6.3 and 6.2?\r\n\r\nAs a user, the best bet is to upgrade to 6.8 (which is compatible with earlier 6.x releases) and then use the 6.8 docs.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/514180236","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44670#issuecomment-514180236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44670","id":514180236,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDE4MDIzNg==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T12:01:45Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T12:01:45Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-search","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/515906595","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44670#issuecomment-515906595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44670","id":515906595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTkwNjU5NQ==","user":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T08:55:53Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T08:55:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 to what @DaveCTurner said. Using \"_doc\" as the \"dummy\" type in later 6.x documentation is necessary, but at the same time we cannot use it going backwards. I understand the irritation but the docs are in sync with what each of the minor versions requires in this case I think.\r\n@cjcenizal does this explanation make sense to you and would you mind if we close this issue?
