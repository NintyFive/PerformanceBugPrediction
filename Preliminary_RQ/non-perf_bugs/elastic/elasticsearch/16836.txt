We need to notice this and fail hard. We've already removed some code that allows us to move forward if we fail to configure log4j (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/9c259aca413f904fcc31d959ab54a6ea8432404a) but we need tests that Elasticsearch dies when the log configuration is totally broken. Without a test that we run consistently we're as likely as not to still allow some broken log configuration to make it through. This feels like a fairly strait forward thing to test in the vagrant infrastructure or in some smoke test.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
