We should consider removing the blanket `--info` from our Jenkins build configurations, as well as perhaps reducing output from some of the more verbose tasks, such as `jarHell` by limiting their output to only reporting failures. If we regularly rely on info conveyed via `logger.info()` we should report this some other way, either by bumping the log level to lifecycle, or perhaps utilizing custom tags or values in build scans, or additional log files. Some things to consider:\r\n\r\nJenkins console logs are so large that working with them is increasingly problematic. The Jenkins UI struggles to even render them.\r\nAll this superfluous logging simply creates a ton of noise that you have to filter out or ignore when actually trying to find the console output relevant to your inquiry (generally, tests).\r\nCapturing, saving, and indexing all this stuff is costly. It’s particularly so for the Jenkins master. Build logs are persisted by the Jenkins master, not the workers, so at any given time the master is loaded down with I/O from writing all these build log files. The more workers we add the worse this gets.\r\n\r\nThanks @mark-vieira for bringing this up!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
