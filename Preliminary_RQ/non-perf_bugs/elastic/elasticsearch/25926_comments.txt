Please ask questions like these in the [Elasticsearch forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) instead.\r\n\r\nAs a hint: If the setting does not change, are you sure you are editing the correct config file? Please see the [directory layout](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rpm.html#rpm-layout) in the docs. The default location for config files installed via RPM is `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`, not `/config/elasticsearch.yml`.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
