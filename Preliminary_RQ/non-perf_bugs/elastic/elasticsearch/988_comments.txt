The following discribes the support regular expression syntax:\n\n```\nregexp         ::= unionexp\n               |\nunionexp       ::= interexp | unionexp                          (union)\n               |    interexp    \ninterexp       ::=  concatexp & interexp                        (intersection)                          [OPTIONAL]\n               |    concatexp\nconcatexp      ::=  repeatexp concatexp                         (concatenation)\n               |    repeatexp\nrepeatexp      ::=  repeatexp ?

Although with this in place the regexp queries performance great improved, it should be noted that they'll still be considerably slower than typical \"exact\" match queries (e.g. term, match, range queries). \n\n## Examples:\n\nA query to match documents where field \"name\" matches regular expression \"j.*n\" :\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"regexp\" : { \"name\" : \"j.*n\" }\n}\n```\n\nSame query with specific regular expression syntax flags provided\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"regexp\" : { \"name\" : { \"value\" : \"j.*n\", \"flags\" : \"INTERSECTION|COMPLEMENT|EMPTY\" } \n}\n```\n\nNote: This multi term query allows to control how it gets rewritten using the [rewrite](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/multi-term-rewrite.html) parameter.\n\nSame syntax applies to filter DSL. All common filter attributes are supported:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"regexp\" : { \n        \"name\" : { \n            \"value\" : \"j.*n\", \n            \"flags\" : \"INTERSECTION|COMPLEMENT|EMPTY\" \n        },\n        \"_name\" : \"all_johns\",\n        \"_cache\" : true,\n        \"_cache_key\" : \"my_cache_key\" \n}\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
