Your assumption is only correct if indices in the cluster have no more then 1 replica. It looks like in your case at least some of the indices have 2 replicas or more. For such indices a primary shard and at least one other replica have to be available to perform index operation with default level of write consistency. The `yellow` health status doesn't guarantee that. This issue is discussed in details in #4755. So, I am going to close this one as a duplicate. Please feel free to reopen it if my assessment of the issue was incorrect and you think that you have a different issue. \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
