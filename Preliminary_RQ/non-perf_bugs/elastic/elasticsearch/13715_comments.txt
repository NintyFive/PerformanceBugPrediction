out it is not so easy to exit in Bootstrap when people run elasticsearch service. For services   convert a variable `CONF_FILE` to `-Des.default.conf` and [pass this to elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/distribution/deb/src/main/packaging/init.d/elasticsearch#L99). So we have to check in the init scripts too if `CONF_FILE` was set. Otherwise someone who configured that before will install elasticsearch, start as usual but the new installation will silently pick up the default conf.\nFor this reason I added a check in all init scripts in #13772  but that is very ugly as @spinscale pointed out.\n\nWe thought the following would be a trade-of:\n- push the ugly changes in #13772 with all the additional checks to 2.0 and 2.x so that there are no bad surprises for people who use the `CONF_FILE` option and upgrade\n- remove `CONF_FILE` and the additional checks completely on master\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/143374475","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13715#issuecomment-143374475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13715","id":143374475,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzM3NDQ3NQ==","user":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-25T23:21:01Z","updated_at":"2015-09-25T23:21:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 to your plan @brwe \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
