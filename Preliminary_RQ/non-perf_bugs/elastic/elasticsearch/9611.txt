I work with ElasticSearch 1.4.2.\n\nI find a bug (maybe) that is much the same as this : https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/5110\n\nI need to specify nested fields in \"fields\" parameter of query string (query_string and simple_query_string). I try a lot of synthax but nothing work fine.\n\n_Steps to reproduce :_ https://github.com/BlackSlashProd/UploadZone/blob/master/ElasticSearch/Nested_Fields_Bug_Reproduce.txt\n**Query 1 and 2 are OK. Query 3 and 4 show the bug.**\n\nAs you can see the problem appears when i specify the queried fields.\nEven if i try `\"fields\" : [\"message\",\"comments\",\"comments_name\",\"comments_comment\"]`.\n\nIt's a bad use ? It's a bug ? it's the same bug as #5110 ? \n\n(Sorry for my broken English).\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
