To remind PR authors and reviewers, we've agreed that we should include a checker step that notifies the PR opener if they've opened a PR without updating the changelog.\r\n\r\nSince not every PR should be required to have a changelog entry, the checker should ignore PRs with the labels \">non-issue\", \">test\" or \">docs\". The checker should also add a comment to the PR when it runs to verify that it either 1) performed the check and it either passed or failed, or, 2) ignored PR because of labeling. This comment is important to have as history since labels are mutable.","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
