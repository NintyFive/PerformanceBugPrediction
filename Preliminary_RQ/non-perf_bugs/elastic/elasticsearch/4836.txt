I think it is important that the documentation present the json api first because it is more generally useful then the language specific api.\n\nSo if you:\n1.  Go to the documentation, say http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html\n2.  Type \"search api\" into the search box.\n\nThe first result is for the java api and second is for the groovy api.  The json api is ninth.  It really ought to be first.\n\nI'm not sure if the right solution is to name the json search api page \"search api\" instead of \"search apis\" or if it'd be better to lower the score of the non-json apis with a document boost or something and expect people to type \"search api java\" if they want the java api which should bring it back to the top.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
