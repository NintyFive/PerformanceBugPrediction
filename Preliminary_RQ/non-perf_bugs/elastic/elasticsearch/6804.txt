using \"terms\" aggregation, it's often useful to get top X terms (achieved by using `size` parameter), but as well get a separate bucket for all other terms together (possibly constrained by minimum doc count). \n\nThe query syntax might be:\n\n```\n{\n    \"aggs\" : {\n        \"tags\" : {\n            \"terms\" : { \n                \"field\" : \"tag\",\n                \"size\": 3,\n                \"min_doc_count\": 10,\n                \"other\": \"_other_terms\"\n             }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd the response might look like:\n\n```\n{\n    ...\n    \"aggregations\" : {\n        \"tags\" : {\n            \"buckets\" : [\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"soccer\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 500\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"hockey\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 400\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"basketball\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 300\n                },\n                {\n                    \"key\" : \"_other_terms\",\n                    \"doc_count\" : 150\n                },\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `_other_terms` bucket will be based on all tags with doc_count > 10 per tag, excluding already listed (top 3).\n\nRelated to
