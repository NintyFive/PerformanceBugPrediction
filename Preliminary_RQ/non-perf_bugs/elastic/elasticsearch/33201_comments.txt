Indeed checking on the build machine, the Jar is not there, only the src and doc jars are.  I suspect this is a bug in Gradle around lazy task evaluation  introduced in 4.8 and publicized in 4.9. We recently updated to 4.10 which might have fixed it.\r\n\r\nIn general it's very time consuming to create reproductions for intermittent issues like this one, instead I will remove the failing tasks completely because:\r\n   - there's no up to date checking on them - so it does needles work when running check on dev machines \r\n   - it does the extract in an external process, which takes more time\r\n   - but most importantly, we have testkit now and that's a better place to assert that the build plugin does indeed add those files.
