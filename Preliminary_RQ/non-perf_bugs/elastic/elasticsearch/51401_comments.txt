See the code [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/0f6ffc20a536d5daecb6fcc0cb5f59cf1acd63ca/server/src/main/java/org/apache/lucene/queries/BlendedTermQuery.java#L150). We favor the most common field by artificially adding 1 to the term frequency. In you example the field `x` contains the term `b`  more often than in the field `y` so we modify the formula so that a match on field `y`  is considered less relevant than a match on field `x`. \r\nWe plan to change this custom formula with the standard [BM25F](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41106) so I hope you don't mind if I close this issue.
