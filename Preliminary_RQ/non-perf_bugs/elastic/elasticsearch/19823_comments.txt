There are images that claim to be \"official\" but they are not vetted by Elastic and we do not support them. Whether or not you already know this. I say it because there is a lot of confusion on this issue.\n\n> Problem is: Elasticsearch happily saved it and and people got paged in at midnight UTC when index failed to roll.\n\nAlso, regarding getting paged at midnight: I feel your pain, I've experienced these issues too. But maybe do not deploy straight to production?\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
