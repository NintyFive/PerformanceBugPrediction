The problem is that `Thread.interrupted()` queries and _clears_ the interrupted status (see also [Javadoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#interrupted--)) which is contrary to what should happen, namely to _set_ the interrupt flag again so code higher up the call stack can check the flag and act accordingly. This is done by calling `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()` (see [Javadoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#interrupt--)).\n","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
