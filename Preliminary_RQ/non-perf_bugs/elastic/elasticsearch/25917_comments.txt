I know scripting is a lot more difficult then something declarative, but the advantage of scripting is that it is super explicit. @jpountz's solution uses `floor` but you could use `ceil` or `round`. So, at least for now, I'm going to close this and recommend @jpountz solution.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
