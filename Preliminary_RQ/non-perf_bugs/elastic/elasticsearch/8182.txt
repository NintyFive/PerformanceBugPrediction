It's important to note their warning (taken verbatim from the above link):\n\n> All JDK 7 versions ranging from 7u21 to 7u55 are buggy with regards to invokedynamic. If you plan to use invokedynamic support, make sure you either use 7u60 or JDK 8.\n\nThis should help to speed up scripting support without any effort.\n\nThanks to Robert and Uwe for pointing it out.\n","closed_by":{"login":"pickypg","id":1501235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1501235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg","html_url":"https://github.com/pickypg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pickypg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
