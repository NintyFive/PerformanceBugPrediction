I've labelled this \"discuss\" but I can't see any easy solution to this given that the parent document and each nested object are separate documents.  The only things I can suggest are:\n- access the `details.amount` field using the `_source` instead (which will be slow)\n- store the `details.amount` value in each nested document as well  (my preferred solution)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/64394110","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8623#issuecomment-64394110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8623","id":64394110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Mzk0MTEw","user":{"login":"bakura10","id":1198915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTg5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1198915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10","html_url":"https://github.com/bakura10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bakura10/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-25T12:44:38Z","updated_at":"2014-11-25T12:44:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\n\nThanks for your answer.
