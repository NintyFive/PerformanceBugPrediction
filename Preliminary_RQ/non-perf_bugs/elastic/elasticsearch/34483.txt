This is all or nothing, it either applies to every transport connection or to none. This means that we can not enable compression on remote-cluster traffic independently from within-cluster traffic. There are compelling reasons to allow these to be separate though. We expect that some architectures will have fast within-cluster interconnects (e.g., 10 GbE or more) but not-so-fast remote cluster interconnects. In these cases, trading CPU for compression on the within-cluster traffic could be a waste, but critical for the remote-cluster traffic.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important for cross-cluster replication where we expect large volumes of data to be transported across potentially small tubes.\r\n\r\nWe should enable setting `transport.tcp.compress` on a per-connection basis so that it can be separate for within-cluster traffic versus each remote-cluster connection.\r\n\r\nIt is worth considering if there are other transport-level settings that would benefit from this enablement as well.","closed_by":{"login":"tbrooks8","id":862472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MjQ3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/862472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8","html_url":"https://github.com/tbrooks8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbrooks8/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
