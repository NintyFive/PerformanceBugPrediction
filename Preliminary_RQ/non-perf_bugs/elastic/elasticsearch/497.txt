You could also just have an attribute \"facetable\" or \"sortable\" which helps users know more outright that their field can be used for those actions without having to know all of the other settings that might be involved in dealing with those cases.\n\nSame for term_vector, omit_norms, and omit_term_freq_and_positions -- what are the higher level cases we could define instead of having to know the nuts and bolts of how the engine works to solve those cases?  like \"allowPositionSearches\" for making sure positions are there. ... you get the idea\n\nAgain, there are plenty of low level lucene imlpementations and engines out there.
