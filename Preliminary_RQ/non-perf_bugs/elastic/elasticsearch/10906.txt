I am running the ELK stack inside of docker. My elasticsearch container has v1.5.1 installed. I am seeing a consistent memory leak while running the elasticsearch container. While running the stack, I do the following:\n\n1.) docker ps\n2.) docker inspect {container id of es} (to get pid)\n3.) top | grep {pid of es}\n\nIf you monitor the process with top while running logspout, performing Kibana searches, etc, the elasticsearch process never gives back any memory and the memory percentage increases gradually over time. Also, I had upgraded from 1.4.0 to 1.5.1 in an attempt to mitigate the problem, as the memory leak exists in 1.4.0 also.\n\nThis has become a serious concern as we would like to be able to stand up the ELK stack for QA and PROD, but cannot while the memory leak exists.\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
