You may need to do an Optimize for that. You can call optimize with the only_expunge_deletes=true to only cater for deletes or alternatively call a Merge operation.\n\nAn update is really a delete+index-new-doc, so the deletions hang around until they are garbage collected by the merge process.  The new suggester (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10746) will take deletions into account\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/100136033","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11040#issuecomment-100136033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11040","id":100136033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDEzNjAzMw==","user":{"login":"yuikns","id":1095780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1095780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuikns","html_url":"https://github.com/yuikns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuikns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuikns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuikns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuikns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuikns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuikns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuikns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuikns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuikns/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-08T07:41:25Z","updated_at":"2015-05-08T07:47:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clintongormley  Thanks for your reply.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
