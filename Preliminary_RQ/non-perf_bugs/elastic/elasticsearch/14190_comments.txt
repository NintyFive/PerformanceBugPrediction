I would love to remove all of the `SearchRequestBuilder` setter methods that end up setting stuff to the `SearchSourceBuilder` object, which should rather be set explicitly using `setSource` only and using `SearchSourceBuilder` directly to provide query, size etc.\r\n\r\nThis would remove all the inconsistencies mentioned in this issue, but it turns out to be quite a change for java api users, breaking as most people are using `client.prepareSearch().setQuery(query)` which would have to become `client.prepareSearch().setSource(new SearchSourceBuilder().query(query))`.  I don't think we should break every single java application at the moment. Also once transport client is going to be deprecated, this will not be a problem anymore.
