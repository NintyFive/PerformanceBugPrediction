Similar for Grok and other things.\r\n\r\nAt this time, each same-feature in Ingest Node and Logstash may have different behavior, has different test suites, and the code is unshared. I believe this is a recipe for bad experience for users and maintenance headaches for us, and I believe we can fix it by enabling code sharing between the two components - Logstash and Ingest Node.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nPossible areas for conflict here:\r\n* Elasticsearch releases are released on different schedules than Logstash plugins are\r\n* Most (all?) code for Ingest Node is in the Elasticsearch repository. This not true for Logstash plugins.\r\n* The execution model between Ingest Node and Logstash are incompatible.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","closed_by":{"login":"jordansissel","id":131818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTgxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/131818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel","html_url":"https://github.com/jordansissel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jordansissel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
