We have multi-phase reduction which should help avoid OOMs but it is still possible to have abusive queries taking a node down. \r\nA recent example OOM was caused by date histograms with 5 minute intervals executed across many time-based indices. Each of the data nodes failed to trip a circuit breaker because they were only seeing a small part of the final result. The multi-phase reduction did nothing to reduce the final number of buckets required and the final OOM occurred while rendering results in `toXContent`. This scenario was exacerbated by the fact there was a top-level terms agg for `hostname` under which there were the date histograms.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
