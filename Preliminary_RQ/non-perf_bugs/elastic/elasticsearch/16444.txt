I came across a bug that seem to be related to the storage of spatial mappings. I have seen this behaviour on  ES 2.0.x and the latest 2.2.0. In 1.7.x this worked without any issues. I am running Ubuntu 15.10 64bit with ES 2.2.0 installed from the elastic PPA. This also occured on a Ubuntu 14.04 64bit installation.\n\nI have attached the json files to recreate the issue. Here are the curl requests using the json files as the payload content.\n\n`curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/test`\n\n`curl -vX PUT localhost:9200/test -d @create-index_broken.json --header \"Content-Type: application/json\"`\n\n`curl -vX PUT localhost:9200/test/entry/124 -d @put-record_working.json --header \"Content-Type: application/json\"`\n(this takes about 6 seconds on my machine)\n\n`curl -vX PUT localhost:9200/test/entry/123 -d @put-record_broken.json --header \"Content-Type: application/json\"`\n\nThe spatial extent is bigger than in the previous request. This takes some time, and eventually I get the following error:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"error\": {\n        \"root_cause\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"index_failed_engine_exception\",\n                \"reason\": \"Index failed for [entry#123]\",\n                \"shard\": \"0\",\n                \"index\": \"test\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"index_failed_engine_exception\",\n        \"reason\": \"Index failed for [entry#123]\",\n        \"shard\": \"0\",\n        \"index\": \"test\",\n        \"caused_by\": {\n            \"type\": \"out_of_memory_error\",\n            \"reason\": \"Java heap space\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"status\": 500\n}\n```\n\nWhen I create the index with a larger precision (1000m), both records are inserted in acceptable time:\n\n`curl -vX PUT localhost:9200/test -d @create-index_working.json --header \"Content-Type: application/json\"`\n\nThe json files are attached as a zip:\n[spatial-index-bug.zip](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/117142/spatial-index-bug.zip)\n","closed_by":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
