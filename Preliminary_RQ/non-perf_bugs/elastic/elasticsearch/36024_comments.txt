Since the Deprecation Info API provides information about indexes that need to be reindexed and as far as I know, there won't be any internal indices requiring upgrade through the [Migration Upgrade API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/migration-api-upgrade.html) in the 7.0 upgrade, it seems like maybe we should remove this two APIs completely?\r\n\r\nWhether or not we remove them, I will need to know whether or not we anticipate any useful data coming from these in 6.7 or not.
