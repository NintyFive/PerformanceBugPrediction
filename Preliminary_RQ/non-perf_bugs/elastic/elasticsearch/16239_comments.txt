The get mapping api is implemented by looking at the cluster state from the master, and doing a manual inspection of the cluster state shows the same inconsistency.\n\nI have a hunch this is a problem in `MetaDataMappingService.PutMappingExecutor`, where I believe it should now simply be regenerating the entire mappings for the given index instead of the current complicated merging into the existing `MappingMetaData` of the index based on the type in the request. /cc @jpountz \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/175632722","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16239#issuecomment-175632722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16239","id":175632722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTYzMjcyMg==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-27T13:41:24Z","updated_at":"2016-01-27T13:41:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good catch @rjernst, this was indeed one of the causes of the problem.
