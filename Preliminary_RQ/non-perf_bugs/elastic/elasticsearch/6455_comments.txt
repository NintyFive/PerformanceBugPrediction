The node level filter cache is the way to go, since it sets bounds on the node level and not per shard. This setting can be changed dynamically, but using the cluster update settings API. Side note, setting expiration on filter cache is probably not worth it, size based eviction tends to be enough.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
