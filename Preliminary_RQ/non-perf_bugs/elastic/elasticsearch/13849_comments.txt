The semantics for the `terms` query is simple: include any document which contains at least one of the listed terms.  \n\nThe `match` query is a very different story.  We've got min should match, fuzziness, cutoff frequencies, tf/idf, phrases and positions, what happens if each entry in the array generates multiple terms? how do we combine the scores from each entry, and how do we combine the scores from the terms from each entry. should we use bool, dis_max, blended?  etc etc etc\n\nWe provide the tools for you to specify the logic you require explicitly yourself, eg:\n\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"should\": [\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"participants\": \"1\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"match\": {\n            \"participants\": \"2\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nor (depending on your needs) perhaps:\n\n```\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"constant_score\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n          \"should\": [\n            {\n              \"match\": {\n                \"participants\": \"1\"\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"match\": {\n                \"participants\": \"2\"\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI don't think we should further complicate an already complicated query when there is a perfectly usable alternative.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
