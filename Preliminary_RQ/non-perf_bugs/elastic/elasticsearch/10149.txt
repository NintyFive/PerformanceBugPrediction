There is an effort to allow to explicitly \"choose\" which field to use by using type prefix (my_type.my_field), but itâ€™s not complete, and there are places where it will never work (like faceting on the field). n In practice though, this restriction is almost never an issue. The field name usually ends up being a good indication to its \"typeness\" (e.g. \"first_name\" will always be a string). Note also, that this does not apply to the cross index case.\n\nBased on comments in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8870 and the known issues around not having validation today on same field name across multiple types in an index, it sounds like it is more appropriate to have a more forceful warning vs. a recommendation - until alternatives are available for #8870.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
