Openssl  seems to support adding the `Bag Attributes` and `Key Attributes` from the safe bug and the cert bag: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/7d38ca3f8bca58bf7b69e78c1f1ab69e5f429dff/apps/pkcs12.c#L670\r\n\r\nbut there seems to be no specification that explicitly defines how these attributes are to be presented in a key/cert file. \r\n[RFC7468](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468#section-3) allows only whitespace before the header (and that only in Lax mode ), but both Openssl and BouncyCastle allow arbitrary content before the header of PEM files. \r\n\r\nI suggest we, too, err a little on the side of interoperability and backwards compatibility with pre-6.4 configurations in the expense of strict conformance to the RFC by allowing and disregarding extra content before the header","performed_via_github_app":null}]
