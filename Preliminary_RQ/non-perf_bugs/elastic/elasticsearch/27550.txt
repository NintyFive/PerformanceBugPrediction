After reading the [sliced scroll](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/search-request-scroll.html#sliced-scroll) section from the scroll API docs I got the impression that sliced scroll is supposed to work when targeting a single shard.\r\n\r\n<!-- Bug report -->\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version** (`bin/elasticsearch --version`): 5.5.2, but I've tested with elasticsearch 6 and reproduced the same behaviour.\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**:\r\n```\r\ncurl localhost:9200/_cat/plugins\r\no2qKP9T ingest-geoip      5.5.2\r\no2qKP9T ingest-user-agent 5.5.2\r\no2qKP9T x-pack            5.5.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`):\r\n```\r\n$ java -version\r\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_141\"\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_141-b16)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.141-b16, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system): I'm using elasticsearch official docker image.\r\n`docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.5.2`\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\r\n\r\nI'm trying to perform a sliced scroll targeting only one shard through routing and elasticsearch is returning all the results in only one of the 2 slices.\r\n\r\nI expect elasticsearch to slice the query/results across all slices, even when targeting one shard only.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nI have created a small bash script to reproduce the problem, please find it [here](https://gist.github.com/alissonsales/77f5a50214ccd71b26a86956b6230c07).\r\n\r\nHere are my results when I run the script using 1 and 2 shards.\r\n\r\n### Using 1 shard\r\n```\r\n$ bash sliced_scroll.sh 1\r\nES version\r\n{\r\n  \"name\" : \"o2qKP9T\",\r\n  \"cluster_name\" : \"docker-cluster\",\r\n  \"cluster_uuid\" : \"bhLcjiBTTBaWlq6OuVC-Mg\",\r\n  \"version\" : {\r\n    \"number\" : \"5.5.2\",\r\n    \"build_hash\" : \"b2f0c09\",\r\n    \"build_date\" : \"2017-08-14T12:33:14.154Z\",\r\n    \"build_snapshot\" : false,\r\n    \"lucene_version\" : \"6.6.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"tagline\" : \"You Know, for Search\"\r\n}\r\nCreate index\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\ncontent-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\r\ncontent-length: 48\r\n\r\n{\"acknowledged\":true,\"shards_acknowledged\":true}Adding docs...\r\nslice id 0 search\r\n4\r\nslice id 1 search\r\n5\r\n```\r\n\r\nElasticsearch returns 2 slices, splitting the query/results as expected.\r\n\r\n### Using 2 shards\r\n```\r\n$ bash sliced_scroll.sh 2\r\nES version\r\n{\r\n  \"name\" : \"o2qKP9T\",\r\n  \"cluster_name\" : \"docker-cluster\",\r\n  \"cluster_uuid\" : \"bhLcjiBTTBaWlq6OuVC-Mg\",\r\n  \"version\" : {\r\n    \"number\" : \"5.5.2\",\r\n    \"build_hash\" : \"b2f0c09\",\r\n    \"build_date\" : \"2017-08-14T12:33:14.154Z\",\r\n    \"build_snapshot\" : false,\r\n    \"lucene_version\" : \"6.6.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"tagline\" : \"You Know, for Search\"\r\n}\r\nCreate index\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\ncontent-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\r\ncontent-length: 48\r\n\r\n{\"acknowledged\":true,\"shards_acknowledged\":true}Adding docs...\r\nslice id 0 search\r\n9\r\nslice id 1 search\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nElasticsearch returns 2 slices, but doesn't split the query/results, returning all results in only one slice.\r\n\r\nI hope this covers all details required to reproduce the issue and I apologise in case this is the expected behaviour and I'm missing something.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAlisson Sales\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
