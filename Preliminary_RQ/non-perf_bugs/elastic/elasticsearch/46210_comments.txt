This sort of question you posted is better suited for our [forum like website](https://discuss.elastic.co/), where not only Elastic employees can answer but also community members.\r\n\r\nAs such, I will close this issue now, kindly suggesting you post your question in the forum I mentioned above.\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe the latest query you posted is the correct one. Please, make sure the mapping was applied correctly to your index, maybe the indexed documents created some unwanted fields automatically?\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"nested\": {\r\n      \"path\": \"publishing_rule.publishing_orders\",\r\n      \"query\": {\r\n        \"bool\": {\r\n          \"must\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"match\": {\r\n                \"publishing_rule.publishing_orders.active\": true\r\n              }\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              \"nested\": {\r\n                \"path\": \"publishing_rule.publishing_orders.transporters\",\r\n                \"query\": {\r\n                  \"bool\": {\r\n                    \"must\": [\r\n                      {\r\n                        \"match\": {\r\n                          \"publishing_rule.publishing_orders.transporters.fteid\": \"81\"\r\n                        }\r\n                      }\r\n                    ]\r\n                  }\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null}]
