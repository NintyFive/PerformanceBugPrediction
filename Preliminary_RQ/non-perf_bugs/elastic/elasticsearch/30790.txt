It would be ideal if whatever did was available to Ingest and hopefully Painless.\r\n\r\nJust exposing an instance of `MessageDigest` is likely to be very inefficient since it is not thread safe. Most systems expect SHA-256 these days rather than MD5 or SHA-1.\r\n\r\n#### Workaround\r\n\r\nIt's possible to [whitelist the `MessageDigest` class in Painless via a whitelist plugin](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/plugins/examples/painless-whitelist). Alternatively, you could write a separate plugin and whitelist that code, or implement a custom `Ingest` processor plugin.","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
