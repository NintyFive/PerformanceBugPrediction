Some ideas on what to report are:\r\n- step change detected\r\n- periodicity detected\r\n- trend detected\r\n\r\nHow this could work technically:\r\n- CPP emits log messages with special marker string denoting log message related to a significant model change\r\n- Java adds a hook to `CppLogMessageHandler` class so that every time such message is discovered, an annotation is created\r\n- Annotation is automatically visible in the UI, just like user-created annotations or other system-created annotations (e.g.: model snapshot annotation)\r\n- When job is deleted, we don't need to delete the annotations as they provide history that the user may want to retain","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
