The timezone in use here (`Canada/Mountain`) and in the discuss issue (`Japan`) are \"obsolete\" timezones and have been replaced by `America/Edmonton` / `Asia/Tokyo` respectively.\r\n\r\nWhat's happening is that internally the date_histogram is converting the TZ on the fly to the \"new\" timezone, but rollup is comparing it against the original.  So it's seeing `America/Edmonton != Canada/Mountain` and failing to run the query because the timezones don't match.\r\n\r\nI think this is fixable in a bwc manner, will work on a PR.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
