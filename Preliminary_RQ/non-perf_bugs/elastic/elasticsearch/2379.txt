This means that I have percolators with identical IDs in different indexes.\n\nWhen I percolate my documents, I specify a query string for the percolators :\n\n```\ntestindex-2b086e73/doc/a889db29-2409-4174-9425-818eb7293b57?percolate=SourceId:1\n```\n\nAnd then the result contains duplicate percolator IDs, as if the index name was ignored :\n\n``` javascript\n{\n    \"ok\" : true,\n    \"_index\" : \"testindex-17eecc11\",\n    \"_type\" : \"doc\",\n    \"_id\" : \"824f26e4-76a6-4b66-9cb2-f3adc0103586\",\n    \"_version\" : 1,\n    \"matches\" : [\"1.789\", \"1.789\", \"1.789\"]\n}\n```\n\nBut when I don't specify a query for the percolators (?percolate=*) the result only contains one ID as expected.\n\n**Edit:**\nI feel like it's an intended behavior in (https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/percolator/PercolatorExecutor.java#L345) is it? If yes, how do I filter percolators only on one documenttype/index?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
