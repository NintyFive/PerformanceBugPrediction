It concerns aggregations that return no results (while it should) when a type has the same name as a field name of an other type.\n\nHere is a way to systematically reproduce the issue:\n\n```\n# If you just change \"state\" with \"state2\" in the second type, everything will work fine\ncurl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/agg_analysis' -d '\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"data\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"state\" : {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"fields\": {\n            \"raw\" : {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"state\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\" : {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"fields\": {\n            \"raw\" : {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n'\n```\n\n```\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/agg_analysis/data/_bulk' -d '\n{ \"index\": {}}\n{ \"state\" : \"New York\" }\n{ \"index\": {}}\n{ \"state\" : \"New Mexico\" }\n{ \"index\": {}}\n{ \"state\" : \"New York\" }\n'\n```\n\n```\ncurl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/agg_analysis/data/_search?pretty' -d '\n{\n  \"size\" : 0,\n  \"aggs\" : {\n    \"states\" : {\n        \"terms\" : {\n            \"field\" : \"state.raw\"\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n'\n```\n\nThis should return a list of 2 states, but returns none. Note that `state` is:\n- The name of a field in the `data` type.\n- And also the name of an other type.\n\nChanging the type name from `state` to `state2` in the mapping will make the aggregation on the `data` type work which is really weird.\n\nTo check this out, you can run all the steps again by replacing from `state` with `state2` in the mapping step.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
