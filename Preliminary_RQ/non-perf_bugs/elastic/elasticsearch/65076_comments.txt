This is also documenten in our [contribution guideline](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-the-elasticsearch-codebase). You can use JDK 11 at runtime but for compilation JDK 14 is required. I can reproduce your error using 11, but everything seems to work as expected on 14. I'm closing this but you can ask for advice and help in our  forums over at https://discuss.elastic.co if you have further questions around this.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/728124820","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/65076#issuecomment-728124820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/65076","id":728124820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODEyNDgyMA==","user":{"login":"Ierezell","id":30974685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTc0Njg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/30974685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ierezell","html_url":"https://github.com/Ierezell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ierezell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ierezell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ierezell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ierezell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ierezell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ierezell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ierezell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ierezell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ierezell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-16T15:13:35Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T15:13:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @cbuescher, \r\nThanks for the quick response ! \r\n\r\nI had other versions of java which leads to error indicating i needed at least java 11.
