Files can now be deleted on windows, although the index is still open - like it was always possible on Unix environments (delete on last close semantics).\n- Speed improvements in sorting comparators: Sorting now uses Java 7's own comparators for integer and long sorts, which are highly optimized by the Hotspot VM..\n\nIf you want to stay up-to-date with Lucene and Solr, you should upgrade your infrastructure to Java 7. Please be aware that you must use at least use Java 7u1.\nThe recommended version at the moment is Java 7u25. Later versions like 7u40, 7u45,... have a bug causing index corrumption. Ideally use the Java 7u60 prerelease, which has fixed this bug. Once 7u60 is out, this will be the recommended version.\nIn addition, there is no Oracle/BEA JRockit available for Java 7, use the official Oracle Java 7. JRockit was never working correctly with Lucene/Solr (causing index corrumption), so this should not be an issue for you. Please also review our list of JVM bugs: http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs\n\nApache Lucene and Apache Solr were also heavily tested with all prerelease versions of Java 8, so you can also give it a try! Looking forward to the official Java 8 release next week - I will run my indexes with that version for sure!\n```\n\nWe should move as well and make Java 1.7 the minimum requirement to run Elasticsearch once we move to `Lucene 4.8`. Note, this is not yet release and it will roughly take a month or so until it will. I am putting es version `1.2.0` on this issue and mark it breaking to notify users. This means everything `>= v1.2.0` will need Java 1.7 and will not run on `1.6` to be absolutely clear.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
