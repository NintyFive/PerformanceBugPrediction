I have not received a response on [the Elastic discussion forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/how-many-threads-does-a-typical-search-use/150934) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52745062/how-are-active-threads-counted-in-elasticsearch) so I thought I would try here.\r\n\r\nWhen a search request fans over multiple shards, does it use threads from each node's thread pool? Would these threads be reflected in the shard's \"active\" thread count? \r\n\r\nFor example, if I have 10 nodes with 1 shard each (10 shards total) and I do a search request, would this search request be reflected as:\r\n\r\n10 \"active\" threads (one for each node/shard)? Or 1 \"active\" thread for the search request?\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
