It was a real problem, and the reason that `ES_HEAP_SIZE` was added.  \n\nInstead of sizing the heap automatically, I'd much prefer:\n- to have one setting for min/max\n- to complain in production mode if that setting is not set\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/220357689","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17686#issuecomment-220357689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17686","id":220357689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDM1NzY4OQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T15:19:30Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T15:19:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We have decided to not go this route, opting instead for the defaults added in #18311 and otherwise requiring manual configuration for now.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
