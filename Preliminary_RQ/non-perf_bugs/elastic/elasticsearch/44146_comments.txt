If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. The discussion forums are beter suited to these sorts of \"how to\" conversations.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/509876351","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44146#issuecomment-509876351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44146","id":509876351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTg3NjM1MQ==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-10T01:57:30Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T01:57:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-analytics-geo","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/509879700","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44146#issuecomment-509879700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44146","id":509879700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTg3OTcwMA==","user":{"login":"HanguChoi","id":12369225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzY5MjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12369225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanguChoi","html_url":"https://github.com/HanguChoi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanguChoi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanguChoi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanguChoi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanguChoi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanguChoi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanguChoi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanguChoi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanguChoi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanguChoi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-10T02:14:28Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T02:14:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you @tvernum, \r\nI also posted this topic the forum you mentioned already. \r\nYou mean, you don't think this is a bug or feature that need to develop? \r\n\r\nI thought it can be a bug, because same explain in [es 1.75 doc](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/search-aggregations.html) and [es 7.2 doc](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html) but seems different result.. \r\n```\r\nThe context of the execution defines what this document set is (e.g. a top-level aggregation executes within the context of the executed query/filters of the search request).\r\n```\r\nAnyway, Thank you for quick response!
