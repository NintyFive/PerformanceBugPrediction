But we can add additional log lines specifically to the create/remove index template code though if needed e.g. `MetaDataIndexTemplateService` similar to what `MetaDataCreateIndexService` does when an index gets created. We should do that for both `removeTemplates` & `putTemplate` methods. I think this is reasonable and wouldn't cause problems at INFO level, assuming that index templates don't get changed all the time.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/372776597","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10795#issuecomment-372776597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10795","id":372776597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjc3NjU5Nw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T18:46:29Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T18:46:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I opened #29027.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
