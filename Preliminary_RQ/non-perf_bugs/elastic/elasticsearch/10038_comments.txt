From my perspective, they both kind of go hand in hand.

When the concrete mapping gets created (e.g. when creating the index), you could have a field with same name but a different date type, which takes precedence over the default one. That affects how the filter gets parsed so that it properly works depending on the data type. That is why we have to wait till the concrete mapping is defined and we cannot parse the filter depending on the default mapping, so we make sure that the filter is properly parsed.

Assume that people who know their data and want \"default pre-defined filtered aliases\" based off of the default mappings, is that a feasible feature request? Would it make sense to have something like this.

I do see your point @shivangshah , I am just not sure how we can get there. The feature you are requesting turns around the _default_ mapping as we would need to lock down the mappings for those fields and make sure that the parsed filter is always consistent with the actual mapping for the field. That would mean that instead of a fallback mechanism we would need to be able to force certain mappings for all of the types.\n\nGiven the work happening in #8871 to have fields of the same name in different types always have the same mapping, perhaps this is something we can support after all?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/90629519","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10038#issuecomment-90629519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10038","id":90629519,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkwNjI5NTE5","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-07T16:19:52Z","updated_at":"2015-04-07T16:19:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"yea, good point @clintongormley that makes sense.
