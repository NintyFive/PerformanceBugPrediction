So, we decided to switch to \"simple_query_string\".  However, we discovered that the same analyzers are not being used for each.  I reviewed \"When Analyzers Are Used\" (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/analysis-intro.html?q=analy#_when_analyzers_are_used) to see if it indicated there would be a difference between simple and regular query string but it did not, so I'm wondering if this is a bug.  For example:\n\n`\"query_string\": {\n   \"query\": \"sales\",\n   \"fields\": [\n      \"title\"\n   ]\n}`\n\nwill use the analyzer for the \"title\" field which is the en_analyzer and properly stem \"sales\" to \"sale\" and find the matching documents.  Simply changing \"query_string\" to \"simple_query_string\" will not.  We have to search for \"sale\" or add an analyzer to the query, like so:\n\n`\"simple_query_string\": {\n   \"query\": \"sales\",\n   \"fields\": [\n      \"title\"\n   ],\n   \"analyzer\": \"en_analyzer\"\n}`\n\nOf course, not all our fields are analyzed the same way and the default behavior described in the documentation reference above makes perfect sense.  Is this a bug or does \"simple_query_string\" not behave the same way w/ respect to field analysis during query?  We are using ES 1.7.2.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
