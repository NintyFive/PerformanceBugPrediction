Unfortunately I failed, since the get template API and the get mappings API don't agree on the formatting of `dynamic: false`.\n\nThe get-mappings returns false as a string (`\"false\"`), whilst get-template returns a boolean.\n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/1 -d '{\n  \"template\": \"test*\",\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"dynamic\": false,\n      \"properties\": {\"field1\": {\"type\": \"string\"}\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/test/1 -d '{\"field1\": \"foo\"}'\n```\n\nnow the template looks like this:\n\n```\ncurl \"localhost:9200/_template/1?pretty\"\n{\n  \"1\" : {\n    \"order\" : 0,\n    \"template\" : \"test*\",\n    \"settings\" : { },\n    \"mappings\" : {\n      \"test\" : {\n        \"dynamic\" : false,\n        \"properties\" : {\n          \"field1\" : {\n            \"type\" : \"string\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"aliases\" : { }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nand the mapping like this :(\n\n```\ncurl \"localhost:9200/test/_mappings?pretty\"\n{\n  \"test\" : {\n    \"mappings\" : {\n      \"test\" : {\n        \"dynamic\" : \"false\",\n        \"properties\" : {\n          \"field1\" : {\n            \"type\" : \"string\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI found this on \"1.6.2\" -- feel free to dismiss if it was already addressed.\n\nI can see, where this is coming from: since `dynamic` is not really boolean (because of `strict`), it needs to be realized as a string in the mapping. But couldn't the template API apply the same logic, so the `\"mappings\": {...` blocks in template and index-mappings become comparable?\n\nNote: I \"solved\" the problem by creating the template with the string `\"false\"`, but for a user this is a little nagging inconsistency...\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
