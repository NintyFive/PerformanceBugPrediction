That isn't supported. I can't see your plugin in the stack trace at all so it is hard to figure out what the actual problem is here.\r\n\r\nFor what it is worth the plugin APIs aren't considered stable. I've been saying for three years that we're two years away from having stable plugin APIs.

The plugin is a private one, but the trace does not show any component of the plugin, seems to be a new checking previous to the doExectute of the particular TransportAction of the plugin that is launching that error. The plugin is not writing anything, is only processing SearchRequests, the documentation says that search is multi index, and it has been so until now. If it helps, I was able to reproduce the same error with the public plugin Carrot2 (https://github.com/carrot2/elasticsearch-carrot2 , I actually had to change a couple of lines for upgrading from the release 5.5.2 to the 5.6.3 of that plugin). I mean, the plugin is not failing, the request does not arrive at the plugin, it fails before even start the processing in the plugin classes. \r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/345227936","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27062#issuecomment-345227936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27062","id":345227936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTIyNzkzNg==","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-17T12:11:26Z","updated_at":"2017-11-17T12:11:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"To me this looks like the Rest action for your plugin has no registered correctly.
