A possible fix is to set the return type to Double.\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/bd8701da4fa7731ceb55cd80b70f712b42902181/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/bucket/histogram/HistogramAggregationBuilder.java#L196-L203\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a test that does not set the `extendedBounds`.\r\n 2. Check for the values of `minBound` and `maxBound`.\r\n 3. `NullPointException` occurs since the return type is primitive and `extendedBounds.getMin()`/`extendedBounds.getMax()` is null.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
