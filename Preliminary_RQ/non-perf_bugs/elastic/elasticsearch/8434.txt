This would be a new syntax and would replace the old `a>b.c` style syntax. We could add a config option to enable the older syntax for bwc. The new syntax would allow for complex aggregation paths for use in reducers to, for example, get properties from a particular bucket in an aggregation, or retrieve all the values of the property `c` in all the buckets even if c is three levels down the aggregation tree. It would also give a standard way to access the root of the agg tree (with '$').\n\nfor reference see: http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
