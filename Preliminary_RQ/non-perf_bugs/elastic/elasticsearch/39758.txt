This will be much worse as ECS will gets more widely used.\r\nSometimes it is possible to solve it by aliases, sometimes it is not - situations like \"dynamic data\" or if needed to do it in already existent index without reindexing/creating new one. In these situations we copy fields in logstash which results to bigger indexes with duplicated data.\r\n\r\nElasticsearch could provide a feature similar to hard links in filesystem - allow to specify links to fields for each single document. So indexing like field1:\"somevalue\", field2:linkto:field1. Or it could be fully automatic - if there are 4 fields with the same data type and exactly same value, store it just once. This feature would help to solve many troubles we are facing to.","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
