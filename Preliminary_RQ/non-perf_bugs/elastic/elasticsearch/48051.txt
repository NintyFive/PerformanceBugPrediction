For instance, you might want to adjust a node-level static setting. The procedure is basically the same, except that you should skip any parts that talk about upgrading the nodes while they're down.\r\n\r\nI think we should have docs specifically for restarts without upgrades, rather than asking users to skip the irrelevant bits of the upgrade docs themselves. This repeats #7169 which was closed (\"Done\"? perhaps we added this and then lost it later?). I'm asking for help from the docs team since I don't think my Asciidoc-fu is up to the task of re-using the bits of the docs we already have.","closed_by":{"login":"szabosteve","id":22324794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzI0Nzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/22324794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve","html_url":"https://github.com/szabosteve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szabosteve/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
