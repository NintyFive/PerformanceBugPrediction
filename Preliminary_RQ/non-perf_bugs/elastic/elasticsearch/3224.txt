This can trigger inconsistencies if a collector consumes a field data instance which has been built for a newer point-in-time AtomicReader which might have additional deleted documents.\n\nFor example, in the following scenario, Q1 will miss some data:\n- Q1 (slow query) starts executing\n- refresh\n- Q2 (fast query) starts executing\n- Q2 requires field data for segment S (preserved through the refresh, but has additional deleted documents) -> load and cache\n- Q1 requires data for segment S -> get from cache (same cache key)\n\nThis problem would be solved by ignoring live documents when loading field data.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
