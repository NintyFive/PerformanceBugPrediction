It looks like you have Logstash configured to point to a non-existing Elasticsearch node?  I suggest you have a look at the [Logstash docs](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html) and if you still can't figure it out, ask on the Logstash mailing list.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
