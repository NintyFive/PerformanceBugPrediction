Having to expose your app to both your CCS node as well as various backend cluster nodes partially defeats the purpose (I see your point that you've tackled the \"hard\" part, aggregating search results in CCS), but being able to remove that direct expose to backend clusters would be more elegant.\r\n\r\nTechnically we can talk to the backends directly, but it's just an added layer we would need in our app. Having this info exposed via CCS would benefit others I suspect as well. Consider the motivator feature parity with non-CCS API calls :)\r\n\r\nBeing that the response data from each backend cluster is unique by `clustername:indexname` keys, this feels like a trivial improvement.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/339577833","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27099#issuecomment-339577833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27099","id":339577833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTU3NzgzMw==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-26T07:32:53Z","updated_at":"2017-10-26T07:32:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If the purpose is talking to a single node, you could achieve that with a proxy between your application and your clusters.
