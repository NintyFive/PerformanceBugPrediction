If you have two queries that uses the same path you need to use a different `name` to disambiguate. It's not explained well in the docs and we should throw an error if we find two `inner_hits` with the same name so I am not closing this issue and will mark it as a bug. However the workaround is simple, just set a different `name` on each `inner_hits` and they will be returned in different sections in the search response.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/455346365","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37584#issuecomment-455346365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37584","id":455346365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTM0NjM2NQ==","user":{"login":"kwojcicki","id":2487946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODc5NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2487946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwojcicki","html_url":"https://github.com/kwojcicki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwojcicki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwojcicki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwojcicki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwojcicki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwojcicki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwojcicki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwojcicki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwojcicki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwojcicki/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-17T21:55:07Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T21:55:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey @jimczi, @imotov looking to take a crack at this :) would looking at https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/InnerHitBuilder.java and https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/InnerHitContextBuilder.java be a good start?
