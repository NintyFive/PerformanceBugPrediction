During that time nodes will only serve reads but writes will stall, waiting for the election to complete. We could relatively easy add an API to force a new master election but that will still take 3s and the old master is likely to re-elected. We could, in theory, introduce a clean master hand-off to another node but this is tricky and I think that are other places we can improve and have more impact (for example, ideas to reduce the 3s duration). \n\nAll that said, I wonder why you see the no master block. All write api should wait for 1 minute before timing out and other operations that require a master should timeout only after 30s. Both of which are much longer than the time it takes to elect a new master.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/138152715","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13346#issuecomment-138152715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13346","id":138152715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODE1MjcxNQ==","user":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-07T01:31:33Z","updated_at":"2015-09-07T01:31:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> All that said, I wonder why you see the no master block.
