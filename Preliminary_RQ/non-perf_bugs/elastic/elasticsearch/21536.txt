However, we changed the default scripting language to Painless in 5.0 and this [confuses users](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/scripted-metric--agg-variable-not-defined/65802) as they get non-obvious error messages when they follow the example in the docs:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n...\r\n       \"reason\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"script_exception\",\r\n          \"reason\" : \"compile error\",\r\n          \"caused_by\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"illegal_argument_exception\",\r\n            \"reason\" : \"Variable [_agg] is not defined.\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"script_stack\" : [\r\n            \"_agg[transactions] = []\",\r\n            \"^---- HERE\"\r\n          ],\r\n          \"script\" : \"_agg[transactions] = []\",\r\n          \"lang\" : \"painless\"\r\n        }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could now either:\r\n\r\n(a) Fix the docs so we explicitly define the scripting language (as I've done on Discuss)\r\n(b) or fix the docs so it works with Painless\r\n\r\nI'd opt for option (b) but maybe we also need code changes then. /cc @jdconrad ","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
