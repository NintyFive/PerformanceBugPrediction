In the first three I see a message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  1> Caused by: RemoteTransportException[[node-2][127.0.0.1:40038][indices:data/read/explain[s]]]; nested: IllegalStateException[unexpected byte [0x32]];\r\n  1> Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: unexpected byte [0x32]\r\n```\r\n\r\nor something similar. These serialization failures then lead to the test failures for these tests.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth I see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1>             \"reason\" : \"Validation Failed: 1: using [from] is not allowed in a scroll context;\",\r\n  1>             \"stack_trace\" : \"[Validation Failed: 1: using [from] is not allowed in a scroll context;]; nested: ActionRequestValidationException[Validation Failed: 1: using [from] is not allowed in a scroll context;];\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think there's a common cause to all of these, a BWC change that the build was not ready for. For the former I think that it's #26145 and for the latter that would be #26235.\r\n\r\nSo, these appear to have been temporary build failures that no longer reproduce now that all branches have caught up.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
