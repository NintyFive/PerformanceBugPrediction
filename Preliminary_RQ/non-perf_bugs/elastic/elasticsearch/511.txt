For example, a document in the following form:\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\" : {\n        \"first\" : \"shay\",\n        \"last\" : \"banon\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd a query string to query any field under `name`:\n\n```\n{\n    \"query_string\" : {\n        \"fields\" : [ \"name.*\" ],\n        \"query\" : \"test\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe matching is done on the full name of the fields, the index name, and the stand alone name, so allows for interesting matching capabilities. The matching is done using the simple pattern matching support (Match a String against the given pattern, supporting the following simple pattern styles: \"xxx*\", \"*xxx\", \"*xxx*\" and \"xxx*yyy\" matches (with an arbitrary number of pattern parts), as well as direct equality.).\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
