The main problem with the NLP approach I took was, that you need to have a couple of gigabytes of memory for the models. And this memory is taken up on each node, instead of the preprocessing component only, so you are wasting a fair share of memory.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68133609","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9041#issuecomment-68133609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9041","id":68133609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MTMzNjA5","user":{"login":"utk4rsh","id":1297606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc2MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1297606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utk4rsh","html_url":"https://github.com/utk4rsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utk4rsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utk4rsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utk4rsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utk4rsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utk4rsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utk4rsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utk4rsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utk4rsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utk4rsh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-26T09:51:28Z","updated_at":"2014-12-26T09:51:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot for the detailed replies.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
