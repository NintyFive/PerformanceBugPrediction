For upgraded indices, it was added as the first format because that reflects how values were parsed in 1.x.  For new indices, it is added as the second format (and so will do what you expect).\n\nIf you reindex your data, things will work as before.  Alternatively, specify the `format` parameter in your aggregation as a workaround.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
