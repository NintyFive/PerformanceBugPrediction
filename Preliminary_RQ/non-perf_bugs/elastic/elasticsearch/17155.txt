Its a bit cumbersome as i have to install each plugin individually. Can i specify just the names of the plugins somewhere and when `kibana` starts up, it will automatically install these plugins. I remember that in Kibana 4.1.x, i could add the following to the `kibana.yml` file\n\n```\nbundled_plugin_ids:\n - plugins/dashboard/index\n - plugins/discover/index\n - plugins/doc/index\n - plugins/kibana/index\n - plugins/markdown_vis/index\n - plugins/metric_vis/index\n - plugins/settings/index\n - plugins/table_vis/index\n - plugins/vis_types/index\n - plugins/visualize/index\n```\n\nis this for already installed plugins? Or is it a way to specify auto install of plugins? Can we do something similar for Kibana 4.4.x?\n\nHow would we do this for Elastic?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
