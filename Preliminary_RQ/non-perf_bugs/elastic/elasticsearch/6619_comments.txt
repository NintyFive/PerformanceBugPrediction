I think that concrete mappings, even with dynamic templates, is very valuable, for example, Kibana can then auto suggest existing fields and such.\n\nI think that there is a lot of improvements that we can add to ES even when it concretely creates mappings. One is this: #6648, the other is potentially to move from update on write data structures (that have a better concurrency story) to update in place concurrent data structures above a certain threshold. Based on my tests, I think we can get to a very good perf while still maintaing the concrete mappings case.\n\nThe cluster state is the place that will suffer, or when someone has 1 million fields for example. But I think that this is simply abusing the system and things will break in other places (in terms of resources used, ...), not just mappings.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/47971747","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6619#issuecomment-47971747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6619","id":47971747,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTcxNzQ3","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-03T19:06:16Z","updated_at":"2014-07-03T19:06:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"update\n- #6648 is in, and will be on 1.3.\n- #6714 is in, will be on 1.3 (memory improvement in analysis for many mappings)\n- #6707 the last one, that brings the perf to acceptable levels, but is a bit trickier in terms of code change, we are still discussing...\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/48089355","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6619#issuecomment-48089355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6619","id":48089355,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDg5MzU1","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-05T15:44:18Z","updated_at":"2014-07-05T15:44:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#6707 has been pushed as well, I think we are at a good state performance wise, so closing this for now, we can reopen a new issue if this is still a problem\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/49604442","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6619#issuecomment-49604442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6619","id":49604442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjA0NDQy","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-21T13:24:47Z","updated_at":"2014-07-21T13:24:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#6843 another one that helps a lot with memory usage here\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
