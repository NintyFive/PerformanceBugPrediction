I assume this is a bug since _score contains a floating point value.\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n```\n# Create empty index\ncurl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/'\n\n# Feed two documents\nfor a in doc1 doc2; do curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/$a -d '{\"foo\":\"foo\"}'; done\n\n# Search with script_score\ncurl http://localhost:9200/twitter/_search -d '{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"function_score\": {\n      \"query\": {\n        \"term\": {\n          \"foo\": \"foo\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"functions\": [\n        {\n          \"script_score\": {\n            \"script\": \"_score * 1\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nNotice that hits have score 0.0. Replace `_score * 1` by `_score` to get the correct score.\n\nI am running elasticsearch 1.7.3 and groovy 2.4.4\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
