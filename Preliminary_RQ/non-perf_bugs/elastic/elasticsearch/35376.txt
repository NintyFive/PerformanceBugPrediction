This function prepares a table for the application to subsequently fetch. The table definition is given within the spec.\r\n\r\nCurrent `SYS COLUMNS` implementation is aligned with the spec with the exception of the following columns, that are all returned as `integer`, while the application expects them as \"Smallint\" (i.e. SQL `SHORT`): `DATA_TYPE`, `DECIMAL_DIGITS `, `NUM_PREC_RADIX`, `NULLABLE`, `SQL_DATA_TYPE`, `SQL_DATETIME_SUB`.\r\n\r\nThis misalignment is problematic for the applications that:\r\n- don't specify a particular type for the driver to convert the result to, but leave it to \"default\" (meaning \"whatever type is in the DB\"), but who also\r\n- provide a buffer for the result which is aligned to the standard.\r\n\r\nFor example: when fetching `DATA_TYPE` value, the application provides a two byte buffer (to accommodate the `SHORT`). Leaving the conversion to \"default\", the driver would then try to access a four byte buffer, corresponding to DB's `INTEGER`, which eventually leads to a failure.\r\n\r\nNow, this application behavior is not really correct (and [the spec advises against](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/appendixes/default-c-data-types) using \"default\" data type, but this is too late for 2.x applications). However, this problem can be mitigated if we aligned our types with the spec.","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
