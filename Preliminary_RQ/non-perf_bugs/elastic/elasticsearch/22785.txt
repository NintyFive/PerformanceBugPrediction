Create an simple index with following mapping for 2.4.1:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"stringtest\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"stringField\": {\r\n          \"index\": \"not_analyzed\",\r\n          \"type\": \"string\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand for 5.1.1\r\n```json\r\n   {\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"stringtest\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"stringField\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"keyword\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 2. Add one million documents with the same text (in my case I added ThisIsAString{i} where {i} is a number that increments for each document) to each index.\r\n 3. The size of the 5.1.1 index is twice the size of the 2.4.1 index (at least in my environment)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
