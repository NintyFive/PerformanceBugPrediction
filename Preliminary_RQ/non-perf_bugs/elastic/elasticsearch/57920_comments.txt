We also enforce the build to fail if someone adds back usage of a deprecated gradle features / apis to keep the build clean. This should give us a good base to keep up with next gradle major releases and allow us to deal with future deprecations in gradle easier. \r\nTherefore I'm closing this ticket as I consider it done.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
