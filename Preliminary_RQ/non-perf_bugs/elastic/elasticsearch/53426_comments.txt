@jasontedor \r\nThank you for working on this issue.\r\n\r\nElasticsearch chart code is in [helm-charts/elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/tree/master/elasticsearch).\r\n\r\nThis chart will create the following K8S resources:\r\n- [StatefulSet](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/statefulset.yaml) which will manage Elasticsearch pods including a few init and side car containers to manage [virtual memory tuning](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/statefulset.yaml#L139-L148), [keystore](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/statefulset.yaml#L149-L184) and [graceful termination](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/statefulset.yaml#L297-L352)\r\n- 2 [Services](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/service.yaml) which will expose the pods as network services internal to the K8S cluster and will be used for node discovery (see [Clustering and Node Discovery](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/README.md#clustering-and-node-discovery) for more details)\r\n- (Optional) [ConfigMap](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/configmap.yaml) which can contain `elasticsearch.yml` and `log4j2.properties` content for example (default values in [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/values.yaml#L23-L28))\r\n- (Optional) [Ingress](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/ingress.yaml) which manage external access to the service\r\n- (Optional) [ServiceAccount](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/serviceaccount.yaml), [Role](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/role.yaml) and [RoleBinding](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/rolebinding.yaml) to manage [K8S RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)\r\n- (Optional) [PodDisruptionBudget](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/poddisruptionbudget.yaml) to ensure HA during updates and K8S operations\r\n- (Optional) [PodSecurityPolicy](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/podsecuritypolicy.yaml) to enforce rules controlling what a pod can do\r\n\r\n## What we would like for this review\r\n\r\n- Validate that a chart deployment with [default values](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/values.yaml) provides a well-configured Elasticsearch clusters\r\n- Validate that we don't need additional K8S resources for specific Elasticsearch use cases (examples additional initContainer, additional volumes for persistency, ...)\r\n- Validate the [default resources requests / limits](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/values.yaml#L57-L63) and [`ES_JAVA_OPTS`](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/values.yaml#L55)\r\n- Validate the [readinessProbe](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/master/elasticsearch/templates/statefulset.yaml#L194-L227) to check that Elasticsearch is ready and help us define a livenessProbe (quoting @Crazybus livenessProbe = I'm dead, restart me / readinessProbe = I'm not ready to receive traffic, wait for me)\r\n- Validate that we can use `RollingUpdate` strategy for [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#rolling-updates) during updates\r\n- Any other thing that could be relevant\r\n\r\nPlease ping me if you have any

Validate the readinessProbe to check that Elasticsearch is ready and help us define a livenessProbe (quoting @Crazybus livenessProbe = I'm dead, restart me / readinessProbe = I'm not ready to receive traffic, wait for me)\r\n\r\nThis quote was originally for non-cluster applications like Metricbeat/Filebeat. For stateful clusters applications like Elasticsearch there is also another really important usage for the readinessProbe. \r\n\r\nUnder normal operating conditions the readinessProbe needs to be \"node aware\". If this is passing, please send requests to me. If it is failing remove me from the service.\r\n\r\nDuring restarts (rolling upgrades, Kubernetes node cluster maintenance or pod rescheduling) this readinessProbe also needs to become \"cluster aware\". This is because Kubernetes will wait for the first pod to be ready before restarting the next one.\r\n\r\nWithout any cluster level health checking here it would mean that Kubernetes would restart each pod in sequence as soon as it started responding to a basic \"I am ready\" check. For Elasticsearch this would mean that nothing was waiting for the cluster to be \"green\" in between restarts of each Elasticsearch pod.\r\n\r\nThe current logic in the readinessProbe will make sure that on initial startup the probe will wait for the cluster to become green. Once this condition is met  the probe switches over to the node level check.\r\n\r\nThis makes sure that cluster health is green before upgrading the next pod, and that already running pods are not considered unhealthy if the cluster health is non-green.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world Kubernetes statefulsets would have different readinessProbes to signify pod level health, and cluster level health for rolling upgrade but this is unfortunately not the case.\r\n\r\nThe readinessProbe:\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/a0e8d77c6a292636ef771e78f24b04b6ea1158bb/elasticsearch/templates/statefulset.yaml#L215-L227","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/600649360","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53426#issuecomment-600649360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53426","id":600649360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDY0OTM2MA==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-18T14:18:38Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T14:18:38Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-core-infra (:Core/Infra/Core)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/604547622","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53426#issuecomment-604547622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53426","id":604547622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDU0NzYyMg==","user":{"login":"pugnascotia","id":8696382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTYzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8696382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia","html_url":"https://github.com/pugnascotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-26T16:57:51Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T16:57:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Feedback from an Elasticsearch POV:\r\n\r\n   * I'm running the latest Docker for Mac and `helm` (via Homebrew).
