The standard tokenizer creates two tokens for the input `005-2011`, `005` and `2011`. Same for `5-2011` except that the tokens are `5` and `2011` and since we don't highlight partial word (and we don't match on them either) the response you get is expected. Please use the forum if you have follow up questions. As said above the issues you're having is due to wrong expectations regarding tokenization and queries so I'd be happy to follow up on the discuss forum. ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
