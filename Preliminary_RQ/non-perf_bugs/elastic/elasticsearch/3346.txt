Then, there will be two doc alive in diffrent shard but the same index.\n\nIt seems the delete operation is broadcasted to all shards, but the index operation not. \n\nSince it's hard to monitor if the routing filed is modified, the only thing I can do is do an delete operation before each index operation, I really don't like it >_<\n# how to reproduce the bug\n\n`Tested under both v0.90.0`\n## [1] Create A Index\n\n``` shell\ncurl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/user' -d '\n{\n    \"mappings\": {\n        \"User\": {\n            \"store\": \"no\",\n            \"_id\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"index\": \"not_analyzed\",\n                    \"store\": \"yes\"\n            },\n            \"_type\": {\n                \"enabled\": true\n            },\n            \"_routing\": {\n                \"path\": \"tag\",\n                \"required\": true\n            },\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"tag\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n'\n```\n## [2] Input Data\n\n``` shell\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/user/User/123' -d '{\"tag\" : \"good\"}'\n```\n\n{\"ok\":true,\"_index\":\"user\",\"_type\":\"User\",\"_id\":\"123\",\"_version\":1}\n\n``` shell\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/user/User/123' -d '{\"tag\" : \"bad\"}'\n```\n\n{\"ok\":true,\"_index\":\"user\",\"_type\":\"User\",\"_id\":\"123\",\"_version\":1}\n## [3] Search\n\n``` shell\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/user/User/_search' -d '{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"term\": {\n      \"_id\": \"123\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"facets\": {\n    \"tag\": {\n      \"terms\": {\n        \"field\": \"tag\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\n{\n    \"took\": 1,\n    \"timed_out\": false,\n    \"_shards\": {\n        \"total\": 10,\n        \"successful\": 10,\n        \"failed\": 0\n    },\n    \"hits\": {\n        \"total\": 2,\n        \"max_score\": 0.30685282,\n        \"hits\": [\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"user\",\n                \"_type\": \"User\",\n                \"_id\": \"123\",\n                \"_score\": 0.30685282,\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"tag\": \"bad\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"user\",\n                \"_type\": \"User\",\n                \"_id\": \"123\",\n                \"_score\": 0.30685282,\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"tag\": \"good\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"facets\": {\n        \"tag\": {\n            \"_type\": \"terms\",\n            \"missing\": 0,\n            \"total\": 2,\n            \"other\": 0,\n            \"terms\": [\n                {\n                    \"term\": \"good\",\n                    \"count\": 1\n                },\n                {\n                    \"term\": \"bad\",\n                    \"count\": 1\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
