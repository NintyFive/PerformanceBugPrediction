In testing, that is not the behavior I see.\n\nWhen I run the following code, each scroll response only contains `<size>` results instead of `<size * num shards>` results.  This is occurring in ES 2.3.1.  I tested using wildcard index name that matches 155 indexes (and millions of documents), each with 8 primary shards.\n\nSwitching the search type to the deprecated 'scan' type changes the behavior to more closely match the documentation.\n\nIs this expected scroll functionality and the documentation is incorrect?  The main [documentation page on scroll](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-scroll.html) makes no reference to size.\n\nResults using scroll:\n\n> Initial Hit Count: 100\n> Scroll Hit Count: 100\n> Scroll Hit Count: 100\n> Scroll Hit Count: 100\n> Scroll Hit Count: 100\n> etc...\n\nResults using scan:\n\n> Initial Hit Count: 0\n> Scroll Hit Count: 123217\n> Scroll Hit Count: 16200\n> Scroll Hit Count: 16071\n> Scroll Hit Count: 16000\n> etc...\n\n```\n        Settings settings = Settings.settingsBuilder().put(\n                \"cluster.name\", CLUSTER_NAME\n        ).build();\n\n        TransportClient tc = TransportClient.builder().settings(settings).build();\n        tc.addTransportAddress(new InetSocketTransportAddress(InetAddress.getByName(NODE_IP), 9300));\n\n        SearchRequestBuilder builder = tc.prepareSearch(INDEX)\n                .addSort(SortParseElement.DOC_FIELD_NAME, SortOrder.ASC)\n                .setScroll(TimeValue.timeValueSeconds(5))\n                .setQuery(new MatchAllQueryBuilder())\n                .setSize(100);\n\n        SearchResponse response = builder.execute().actionGet();\n        System.out.println(\"Initial Hit Count: \" + response.getHits().getHits().length);\n\n        while(true)\n        {\n            response = tc.prepareSearchScroll(response.getScrollId()).setScroll(TimeValue.timeValueSeconds(5)).execute().actionGet();\n            System.out.println(\"Scroll Hit Count: \" + response.getHits().getHits().length);\n            if (response.getHits().getHits().length == 0) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"nik9000","id":215970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/215970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000","html_url":"https://github.com/nik9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nik9000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
