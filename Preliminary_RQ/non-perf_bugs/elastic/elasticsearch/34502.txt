attaching the [complete log snippet for this test suite](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/2481658/SSLTrustRestrictionsTests_full_log.txt).\r\n\r\nWhat's noticeable: This build failed on MacOS 10.13.3. I wonder whether some lingering thread holds onto the file `trust_restrictions.yml` and at this point I am not sure whether this is a problem specific to this test or whether this is a general problem on MacOS 10.13 which uses [APFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System). \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
