I'm imaging something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /_painless/execute\r\n{\r\n  \"script\": {\r\n      \"source\": \"params.count / params.total\"\r\n      \"params\": {\r\n          \"count\": 100\r\n          \"total\": 1000\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the response would be something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"result\": 0.1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously this is a very simple example but with this type of interface we could replace the \"math\" (which uses Math.js) aggregation in TSVB with Painless and provide a way for the user to create scripts that allow them to manipulate data essentially the same way (but more secure).  This would also provide a way to create interfaces for and testing and debugging painless scripts. I'm sure Rashid could use this as well in the new Canvas project to provide scripting as well.\r\n\r\n@jdconrad  @rashidkpc @epixa ","closed_by":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
