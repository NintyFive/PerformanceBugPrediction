It also got me wondering why it's needed in the first place, @rjernst.\r\nRunning with a newer jre should allow us to inspect older versions of the byte-code, so why does it matter ? \r\n\r\nIt does matter when we have rules for JDK methods such as `java.lang.Thread#stop(java.lang.Throwable)` which was removed in Java 11, but only because the rule engine can't resolve the method. That could be addressed by `failOnMissingClasses`, and `getFailOnUnresolvableSignatures` but that doesn't buy us much, since the code would not compile on newer JDK version, so we would detect it anyhow.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what would happen if a third party jar would use such a removed method ? Would it fail at runtime ? But we wouldn't detect such usage anyhow since we don't inspect the bytecode of  everything on the classppath, just the class files of the project. \r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/404728964","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31715#issuecomment-404728964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31715","id":404728964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDcyODk2NA==","user":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-13T05:24:11Z","updated_at":"2018-07-13T05:24:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We do have a separate check for third party dependencies, and we do need to check with specific java versions due to multi release jars.
