The caller may have a pre-allocated array that it fills with the `yield`ed values.  So several small array allocations, or worse, collections that require primitive type boxing to use, become one large array allocation and an occasional expansion of the array.\r\n\r\nThere are complications.\r\n\r\nA) `yield` is not appropriate in contexts where a single value is returned, such as filter scripts.  \r\n\r\nB) The interaction between `yield` and `return` (both bare return and return value) is messy.  Should a user be able to `yield` AND `return` in the same script?  If not, then how do they terminate early after their done `yield`ing?\r\n\r\n@jimczi @nik9000 @jdconrad @rjernst please add anything I missed","closed_by":{"login":"stu-elastic","id":24232742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjMyNzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/24232742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic","html_url":"https://github.com/stu-elastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu-elastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
