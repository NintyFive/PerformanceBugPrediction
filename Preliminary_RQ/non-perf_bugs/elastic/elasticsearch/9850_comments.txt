If you have a float, it will be casted to a double.\n- 3350.2 cannot be represented accurately as a floating-point number\n\nHere is a code snippet (in Java but would do the same in other languages) that demonstrates the problem that you are seeing:\n\n``` java\nfloat f = 3350.2f;\nSystem.out.println(f); // prints 3350.2\ndouble d = f;\nSystem.out.println(d); // prints 3350.199951171875\nd = 3350.2;\nSystem.out.println(d); // prints 3350.2\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
