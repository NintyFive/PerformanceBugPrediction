Why do you have so many shards and why are you trying to create 4000 at one time? The cause of this error is probably due to the thread pool and queue filling up and causing rejected executions. \r\n\r\nWithout any kinds of steps to reproduce there is not much we can do to diagnose this but regardless the solution here is to not overload your cluster with too many shards and to not try to create 1000's of shards in one go on such a small cluster. If you can reproduce this on a more reasonable cluster size with a more reasonable number of shards please post the steps for reproduction. For now I will close this issue","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/341372962","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27226#issuecomment-341372962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27226","id":341372962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTM3Mjk2Mg==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-02T10:03:05Z","updated_at":"2017-11-02T10:03:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"From your log messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2017-11-02T10:35:44,801][ERROR][i.n.u.c.D.rejectedExecution] Failed to submit a listener notification task.
