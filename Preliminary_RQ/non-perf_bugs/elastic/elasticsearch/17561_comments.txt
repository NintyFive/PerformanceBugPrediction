For instance, the following:\n\n```\nPUT _template/test\n{\n  \"order\": 0,\n  \"template\": \"persons*\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"index\": {\n      \"number_of_shards\": \"1\",\n      \"number_of_replicas\": \"0\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"person\": {\n      \"dynamic\": \"strict\",\n      \"_all\": {\n        \"enabled\": false\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n          \"index\": \"not_analyzed\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow put a document with type `personx`, which should have been prevented:\n\n```\nPUT persons_1970/personx/1\n{\n    \"name\" : \"Henk\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `personx` type is added.  If the index already existed at the time we tried to add `personx`, then this would fail.  Setting `index.*` settings in the config file is no longer supported in 5.0 so I'm going to close this issue.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
