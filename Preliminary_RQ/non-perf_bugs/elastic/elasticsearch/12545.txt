Occasionally - but not every day - I have an event of type \"bar\" that has field called \"enddate\".  I would like to query for these events, and sort by the \"enddate\" field.\n\nUnfortunately, elasticsearch is checking the mapping before it checks the data.  When the daily index contains no rows of this type, the \"enddate\" field doesn't appear in the mapping, and the query fails:\n\n```\nParse Failure [No mapping found for [enddate] in order to sort on]]\n```\n\nThe work-arounds seem to be either to define a fixed mapping, or insert dummy records every day.  Both are bad.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
