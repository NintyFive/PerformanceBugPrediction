Posting it now.)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that I agree with the premise of the issue, I think if you look at EQL in Elasticsearch within a vacuum, then yes, the event type is purely an alias for `event.category == \"<eventType>\"`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think you can or should look at it in a vacuum. At the most basic level, an identifier is just a name for something. For EQL in Endgame, each event type actually had a separate schema. So if you did `process where X` then the condition X is validated against the `process` event schema. Also, for those implementations, the event type actually lives both outside and inside the event data. The event type is basically the name for the class of events you're looking at.\r\n\r\nWhen we were first exploring EQL, we actually had a length discussion (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49462) about how the \"event type\" concept will translate into Elasticsearch. It wasn't an obvious choice and there were pros and cons for several possible approaches. That just emphasizes how choosing to use `event.category` as the matched field is purely an implementation detail and not a property of the language or specification itself.\r\n\r\nSince the `event.category` alias is an implementation detail of EQL in Elasticsearch, then what should be the syntax that's captured in the grammar/specification? I think an identifier (since it's just a name anyway) actually makes sense. \"I'm looking for `eventType` events that match `condition`\". You're naming the type of event that you're looking for.  EQL has pipe identifiers, function name identifiers and field name identifiers. I'm not sure why the syntax for event type identifiers should be special and look like strings, instead of using the `` `<escaped event type>` `` notation, which already represents an escaped identifier that may contain special characters","performed_via_github_app":null}]
