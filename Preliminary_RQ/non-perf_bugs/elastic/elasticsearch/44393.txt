Downgrading to 6.7.1 resolves the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Setup a maven project with the following dependency\r\n```        \r\n<dependency>\r\n        <groupId>org.elasticsearch.client</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client</artifactId>\r\n        <version>6.7.2</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n 2. Try and compile the following:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.http.HttpHost;\r\nimport org.elasticsearch.action.index.IndexRequest;\r\nimport org.elasticsearch.client.RestClient;\r\nimport org.elasticsearch.client.RestHighLevelClient;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n        RestHighLevelClient client = new RestHighLevelClient(RestClient.builder(HttpHost.create(\"localhost:9200\")));\r\n        client.index(new IndexRequest(\"some-index\", \"_doc\", \"some-id\"));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 3. On version 6.7.2, the above does not compile (will complain \"IndexRequest\" is missing). On 6.7.1, the code does compile.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbaiera","id":875779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/875779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera","html_url":"https://github.com/jbaiera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbaiera/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
