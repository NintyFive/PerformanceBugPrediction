In some cases one of the disk can become unresponsive in which case some APIs like `/_nodes/stats` might get stuck. The ongoing writes can be stalled till this state is detected by some other means and disk replaced. I believe the lag detector with 7.x would be the first to figure this out and remove the node from the cluster state but only if there has been a cluster state update. Could this be detected upfront with deeper health checks","closed_by":{"login":"ebadyano","id":26631211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjMxMjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26631211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano","html_url":"https://github.com/ebadyano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
