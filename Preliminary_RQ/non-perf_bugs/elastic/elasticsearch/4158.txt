If you use concurrentRequests > 0, calling close() will execute a new bulk request asynchronously then return immediately.  \n\nIt's possible to write a wrapper around BulkProcessor to implement this behaviour, but it's a bit tricky as you have to understand the Exception handling quirks of BulkProcessor and be aware that every call to listener.beforeBulk() will not guarantee a corresponding call to listener.afterBulk().  \n\nIt would be nice to have this behaviour implemented as part of the core library.
