Bug report -->\r\n\r\n**Elasticsearch version**: 5.2\r\n\r\n**Plugins installed**: none\r\n\r\n**JVM version** (`java -version`): 1.8.0_131\r\n\r\n**OS version** (`uname -a` if on a Unix-like system):\r\nLinux 3.10.0-514.6.1.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Jan 18 13:06:36 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**: \r\n\r\nAction: I match on textfield \"myfield\" twice in the same query: once normally, once fuzzy (with a 0.1 boost factor), then I apply highlighting on \"myfield\".\r\n\r\nExpected Behaviour: Highlighting shouldn't highlight fuzzy results unless asked to do so.\r\n\r\nActual Behaviour: The highlighting highlights fuzzy results. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n 1. Create an index with a type and one text field in it called \"myfield\"\r\n 2. Add documents with the following value for \"myfield\":  \"gas\", \"was\", \"has\"\r\n 3. Query the index matching on 1)myfield, and 2)myfield with fuzzyness of AUTO. Add highlighting for myfield. Use search term \"gas\". \r\n 4. Highlighting will highlight \"was\" and \"has\"\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
