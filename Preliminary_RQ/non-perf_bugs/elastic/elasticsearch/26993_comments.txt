It brought less GCs and less memory allocations and some users reported that this change make the snapshots faster.\r\n\r\nI experimented the `TransfertManager` class and various sizes of snapshots and I didn't see any big performance improvements. The current blob uploading code is now easy to understand and to maintain, so I prefer not to change it and incur the risk to introduce new bugs. This decision is of course not definitive and we could decide in the future to use this class.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
