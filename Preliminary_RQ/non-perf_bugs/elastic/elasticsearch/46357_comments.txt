Engineers hear \"phase\" and think of the actions a lifecycle policy takes upon an index entering a particular phase, actions which are of course finite. These two concepts are out of alignment.\r\n\r\nI think the long-term solution is to align the users' and engineers' perspectives. We need to let users view their indices in the UI in a way that aligns with their mental model. It seems like there's no quick solution here, so I'd like to keep this issue open or replace it with another terser one to track that goal.\r\n\r\nIn the short-term, I'll open an issue and corresponding PR that removes this filter from Index Management because I feel like it will cause confusion among the majority of our users.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/530619089","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46357#issuecomment-530619089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/46357","id":530619089,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDYxOTA4OQ==","user":{"login":"cjcenizal","id":1238659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg2NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1238659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal","html_url":"https://github.com/cjcenizal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T00:46:19Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T00:46:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Issue: https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/45484\r\nPR: https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/45486","performed_via_github_app":null}]
