This is related to CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\nThe code issue is located in file KeyStoreWrapper, line 40. The default pass phrase key value is hard coded which is used to decrypt the private key file. Knowing the public key, private key and algorithm methods an attacker can find a back door to break the algorithm patterns used.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
