I suspect that you've some files from a previous installation in the same directory. The top of the exception message that you've truncated would give the conflicts, which would help you track this down. Since I don't think there's a bug here, and we reserve GitHub for verified bug reports, if you need additional help tracking this down, I'd ask that you use the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co). If you do this, it would help if you included the top of the exception message. If it turns out there is a bug here, we can reopen this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
