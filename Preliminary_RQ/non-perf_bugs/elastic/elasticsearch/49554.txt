Elasticsearch offers standard deviation (STDDEV) and variance (VAR) both in [population form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) however there's also the `sampling` form which depending on the data size, can yield significantly different results.\r\nAs it's just a matter of a (somewhat) different formula, it should be straight forward to expand the current implementation [Extended Stats](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch///reference/current/search-aggregations-metrics-extendedstats-aggregation.html) to support this variant as well.\r\n\r\nPotentially to avoid any ambiguities going forward, the current `std_deviation` could be aliased to `std_deviation_population` (same for `variance`) so one could easily pick up the desired type and while also being clear about what type the default fields are.\r\n\r\nThe improved response can look something like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    \"aggregations\": {\r\n        \"grades_stats\": {\r\n
