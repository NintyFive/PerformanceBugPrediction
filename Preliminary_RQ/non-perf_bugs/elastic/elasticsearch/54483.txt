So I used org.elasticsearch.action.update.UpdateRequest object to upsert process. \r\nThe code is blow.\r\n>String type = map.remove(\"<%=UPDATE%>\")+\"\";\r\n>String index = map.remove(\"<%=INDEX%>\")+\"\";\r\n>String id = map.remove(\"<%=ID%>\")+\"\";\r\n><%=cid%>_request.add(new org.elasticsearch.action.update.UpdateRequest(index, type, id).doc(map, org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.XContentType.JSON).docAsUpsert(<%=DOC_AS_UPSERT%>));\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when I had put the document without index mapping, it was so successfully working but what if index mapping was exist before or created, it put out message \r\nas \"ElasticsearchException[Elasticsearch exception [type=illegal_argument_exception, reason=Rejecting mapping update to [test-es1] as the final mapping would have more than 1 type: [_doc, UPDATE]]]\" and failed to upsert.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been removing second parameter(type-\"UPDATE\") of UpdateRequest object, everything was so good working.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nPlease include a *minimal* but *complete* recreation of the problem, including\r\n(e.g.) index creation, mappings, settings, query etc.  The easier you make for\r\nus to reproduce it, the more likely that somebody will take the time to look at it.\r\n\r\n 1.\r\n 2.\r\n 3.\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\nElasticsearchException[Elasticsearch exception [type=illegal_argument_exception, reason=Rejecting mapping update to [test-es1] as the final mapping would have more than 1 type: [_doc, UPDATE]]]\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
