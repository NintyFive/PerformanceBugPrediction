With more and more clients ingesting network related log data, it would be especially helpful if we could include CIDR notation and ranges as viable options for better searching. Ideally, Elasticsearch would be able to then interpret that block so that searching 192.168.1.5 would find CIDR block 192.168.1.1/16 as well as 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.120.\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\nMy clients have multiple layers of network security devices blocking and allowing specific types of traffic. It's not uncommon for a single packet to travel through 1 or more firewalls and then IPS or switch with its own security setting. Those settings typically express source and destination the rule applies to in one of the following ways:\r\n\r\nCIDR ID: 192.168.1.1/31\r\nRange: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.1\r\nComma separated: 192.168.1.0, 192.168.1.1\r\n\r\nIt would be trivial to split out comma separated values using grok filters in most cases, but for larger ranges and CIDR blocks, we'd have to create potentially thousands of mostly redundant records to record the full range properly.","closed_by":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
