This would allow you to not only have on/off detection but also detect flapping watches as part of your execution and than act accordingly. This will also solve your use-case.\r\n\r\nI will however close this issue in the Elasticsearch repo, as this repository is only for the development and discussion of the open source part of Elasticsearch. Feel free to post any suggestions in our [x-pack discussion forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/x-pack) though. Happy to get any input and have further discussions!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
