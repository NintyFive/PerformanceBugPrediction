I had a method like findByNumber(), and if I passed a negative number, the results found were completly unrelated to the said number. Filter worked nicely with positive values. Because under the hood, it were using a query_string and the -X was converted to string and \"-\" interpreted as an operator character.\r\n\r\nJust have to find how to escape this in Spring Data Elasticsearch. Thanks for the subject and answer, but what does \"-\" do in a query string so ? ","performed_via_github_app":null}]
