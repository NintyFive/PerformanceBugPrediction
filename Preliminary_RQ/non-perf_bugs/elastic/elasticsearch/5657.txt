I have created the following setup.\nAn ES cluster with three nodes. A shared file system which can only be accessed by Node 1[Master] and Node 2. This shared fs is registered as the repository for taking backups on Node 1.\n\nI noticed that even if I \na) force some of my data to be present only on Node 3, and \nb) ensure that Node 3 cannot access the shared repository\n\nTaking a snapshot of the entire cluster still reports a success. However, when I browse the contents of the snapshot folder, I do not see any of the data from Node 3. I was expecting a \"RepositoryMissing\" exception to be thrown by Node 3. Have I misunderstood how ES snapshotting works?\n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
