I extracted a Java based junit test (see gist) that succeeds on 0.20.6 and fails on 1.0.1. I was unable to reproduce using curl which makes me think this might be limited to the Java client.\n\nThe test uses a custom analyzer (composed of standard filters) and a dynamic mapping template. The custom analyzer performs a special handling for structured numbers that should prevent hits on reordered number groups. This does not seem to be working right in 1.0.1 (seems like the standard analyzer is used regardless of mapping).\n\ngist: https://gist.github.com/jfiedler/9485429\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
