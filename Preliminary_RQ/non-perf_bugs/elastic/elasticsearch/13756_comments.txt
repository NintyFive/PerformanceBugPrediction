As much as we hope that admins out there will thoroughly test and read the documentation on breaking changes, this is unfortunately not always the case, so I am just wondering if it is better to still allow the node to start up and just continue to throw these exceptions to the log on every start up (or attempt to invoke scripting when it is disabled) just to remind the admins to do some clean up.  But I do see your point here, this will simply shift the surprise to when they actually have to use scripting/runtime :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/142787359","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13756#issuecomment-142787359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13756","id":142787359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Mjc4NzM1OQ==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-24T02:43:03Z","updated_at":"2015-09-24T02:43:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can the migration plugin catch that?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/143184051","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13756#issuecomment-143184051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13756","id":143184051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzE4NDA1MQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-25T10:35:53Z","updated_at":"2015-09-25T10:35:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No it can't.
