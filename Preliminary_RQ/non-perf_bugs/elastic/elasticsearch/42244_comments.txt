second CI failure can be reproduced with the seed from above on both 7.2 and master. The problem seems to be long and complex histories (many timeouts) making the linearizability checker choke on it. We could improve the caching strategy for large histories, but this specific problem does not appear with the unresponsive network simulation fix from #42579 so will leave this for now.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
