This makes the above more challenging.\n- The existing mechanism for passing this information around (`Settings`) is not secure: credentials are kept around in memory, passed too to many places, held in `java.lang.String`. We need a new mechanism that is a one-time handoff to the target plugin and then erases itself.\n\nSo I think we need to walk before we can run, that is all.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/146421565","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13555#issuecomment-146421565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13555","id":146421565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjQyMTU2NQ==","user":{"login":"robertsmarty","id":4920375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjAzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4920375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty","html_url":"https://github.com/robertsmarty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-08T05:15:30Z","updated_at":"2015-10-08T05:15:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the detail!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
