This is static information on the node, and 'min' and 'max' here indicate the core pool size and max thread pool size with respect to the ThreadPoolExecutor.\n\nGET _nodes/stats/thread_pool is meant to show the current state of each thread pool, where 'threads' in the latter is showing a dynamic reporting of the current number of live threads for the given thread pool (based on ThreadPoolExecutor's getPoolSize()).\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
