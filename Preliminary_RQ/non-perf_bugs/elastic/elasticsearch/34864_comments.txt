In 6.x change the default search size to something big like 100000.  This will make the endpoint behave as it does today except for users with extreme, unheard of, numbers of jobs.\r\n2. In 7.0 introduce paging with a lowish default page size, and document it as a breaking change.  This will also require a major overhaul of how the jobs list in the UI works though, so we will have to check that time is available to do the UI work before adding paging.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, in 7.0 the UI could be changed to search the `.ml-config` index directly to get jobs.  Then the UI's ability to search and filter the jobs list could be preserved without us having to add a large amount of functionality to the GET jobs endpoint.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/444518119","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34864#issuecomment-444518119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34864","id":444518119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDUxODExOQ==","user":{"login":"sophiec20","id":4185750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODU3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4185750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophiec20","html_url":"https://github.com/sophiec20","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophiec20/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophiec20/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophiec20/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophiec20/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophiec20/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophiec20/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophiec20/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophiec20/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophiec20/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-05T15:08:41Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T15:08:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Current implementation is limited to first 10 jobs.
