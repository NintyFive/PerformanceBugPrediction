Catalina will [require applications distributed outside of the Mac App Store to be signed and notarized](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution). For Elasticsearch specifically, this requires that:\r\n - the bundled JDK be signed/notarized\r\n - we handle that JNA extracts a native library at runtime\r\n - the ML binaries be signed/notarized\r\n\r\nThe bundled JDKs produced by Oracle are signed but not notarized, we are exploring our options here including using a bundled JDK from a different source. JNA is not signed and notarized, our best option here is probably that the bundled JDK have the unsigned library entitlement. For the ML artifacts, we are currently working on integrating signing and notarization into our release pipeline.","closed_by":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
