This was originally set up this because 99% of the reasons why a node can't form a cluster are temporarily and you actually want it to retry. Also, even if the node will quits an external service will just start it up again in many cases. \r\n\r\nWith the the introduction of the hard node id rule, I agree it would be nice if the node will quit to make this issue more apparent. Sadly the current flow of code makes it hard to stop the node and I'm not sure it's worth the extra complexity - it is clear that something is wrong (the node doesn't join) and we log it. Also, since pinging takes 3 seconds, I think the amount of generated logs should not be that great.
