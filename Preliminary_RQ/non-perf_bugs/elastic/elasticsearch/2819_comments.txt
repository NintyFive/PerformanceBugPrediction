I had a look at your example data, and actually none of the range queries would actually work with those documents. \n\nThe reason is that you did map the `screened` field as a date, specifying a format or it as well, but that format is used when you submit the document as a `string`. If you provide it as a number, it will get indexed as is, since date fields are internally represented as `long`. So, the number doesn't get converted to a string and then parsed as a date...but it gets indexed directly as a time from epoch. In fact in your case the numeric value 20130325110225 was indexed as something like  Fri, 27 Nov 2607 20:58:30 GMT I believe.\n\nTo solve this you need to submit the field as a string with the specified format (just add double quotes around it). Otherwise if you want to submit it as number, the long must be a time from epoch.\n\nAdding the double quotes both queries work with 0.90.5, also after #2808 was fixed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/35110934","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2819#issuecomment-35110934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2819","id":35110934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTEwOTM0","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-14T18:30:40Z","updated_at":"2014-02-14T18:30:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing, seems like there was an issue with the submitted documents as said above.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
