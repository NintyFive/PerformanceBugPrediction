I am trying to perform a match_phrase_prefix query. Yet, in my staging environment when I just search for \"te\" the result comes back as expected. In production, I have to extend my search query to \"tes\" (3 letters) to retrieve the document.\n\nThe query I am issuing is a follows:\n\n```\n    {\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match_phrase_prefix\": {\n      \"title\": \"test\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"post_filter\": { \n    \"term\": {    \"uniqueId\":\"my_unique_id\" }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe only difference I can see between the two environments are the amount of documents index.\n\nIn my staging environment, I have approx. 150k documents index which equates to about 297M.\n\nIn production, I have over 120 millon documents indexed which equates close to 120gb.\n\nIs this a scale problem, or is there some elasticsearch setting that I am missing. Like I said the mappings and settings are identical across the environments, so I am a bit stumped here.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
