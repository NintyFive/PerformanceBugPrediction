Basically just `reindex` and friends do this and only when they are run with `?wait_for_completion=false`. We *expect* them to take a long time so they opt in to this.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that *everything* is a task and you'd up in a bad spot if you tried to create a record of every task. To be honest, if a bulk update is so large that you worry about it timing out while waiting on it I think you are better off splitting it up.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/375689557","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29212#issuecomment-375689557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29212","id":375689557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTY4OTU1Nw==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-23T14:49:34Z","updated_at":"2018-03-23T14:49:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@shivendrasoni if your bulk indexing takes longer than what's reasonable for a timeout variable, something else is off. As Nik explained, tasks that are expected to run a very long time have this support. If we're missing it somewhere, we should add it but I don't feel that the bulk API is a good candidate. We can try to figure out what makes the bulk API so slow , if you open a topic on discuss.elastic.co and get back to github if there something to change in the code. Hope this helps.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
