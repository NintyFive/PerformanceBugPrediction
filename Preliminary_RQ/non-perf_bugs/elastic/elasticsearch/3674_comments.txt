This is great as we've been working on some rare failure cases the past few weeks. We see them since we switched to randomized testing [1]. We have seen something like the second one before, but not the first.  Can you share the complete log output for both? I have a couple of questions: \n\nWere you running the tests while the machine was under load? \nWhich jvm are you using? \nCan you reproduce the failure on your machine? (I cannot unfortunately.) If so, could you try with using only one jvm (add the -Dtests.jvms=1 param)?\n\n[1] http://labs.carrotsearch.com/randomizedtesting.html\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/24363672","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3674#issuecomment-24363672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3674","id":24363672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzYzNjcy","user":{"login":"h4ck3rm1k3","id":34903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/34903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4ck3rm1k3","html_url":"https://github.com/h4ck3rm1k3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4ck3rm1k3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4ck3rm1k3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4ck3rm1k3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4ck3rm1k3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4ck3rm1k3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4ck3rm1k3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4ck3rm1k3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4ck3rm1k3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4ck3rm1k3/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-12T23:30:37Z","updated_at":"2013-09-12T23:30:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"on the second run, this first one worked.\n/home/mdupont/experiments/maven/OME/experiments/maven/apache-maven-3.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/mvn test -Dtests.seed=23CD52CEE15D72 -Dtests.class=org.elasticsearch.routing.SimpleRoutingTests -Dtests.method=testSimpleSearchRouting -Dtests.prefix=tests -Dtests.integration= -Dtests.nightly= -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Duser.timezone=America/Los_Angeles\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\n[INFO]  \n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Building elasticsearch 1.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- maven-enforcer-plugin:1.0:enforce (enforce-maven) @ elasticsearch ---\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- buildnumber-maven-plugin:1.2:create (default) @ elasticsearch ---\n[INFO] Checking for local modifications: skipped.\n[INFO] Updating project files from SCM: skipped.\n[INFO] Executing: /bin/sh -c cd /home/mdupont/experiments/elasticsearch && git rev-parse --verify HEAD\n[INFO] Working directory: /home/mdupont/experiments/elasticsearch\n[INFO] Storing buildNumber: fddb7420ae266378499ac51215ffe040f81ce31a at timestamp: 1379028572295\n[INFO] Executing: /bin/sh -c cd /home/mdupont/experiments/elasticsearch && git rev-parse --verify HEAD\n[INFO] Working directory: /home/mdupont/experiments/elasticsearch\n[INFO] Storing buildScmBranch: UNKNOWN\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- maven-resources-plugin:2.5:resources (default-resources) @ elasticsearch ---\n[debug] execute contextualize\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources.\n[INFO] Copying 1 resource\n[INFO] Copying 5 resources\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- maven-compiler-plugin:2.3.2:compile (default-compile) @ elasticsearch ---\n[INFO] Compiling 36 source files to /home/mdupont/experiments/elasticsearch/target/classes\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- forbiddenapis:1.3:check (check-forbidden-apis) @ elasticsearch ---\n[INFO] Reading bundled API signatures: jdk-unsafe\n[INFO] Reading bundled API signatures: jdk-deprecated\n[INFO] Reading bundled API signatures: jdk-system-out\n[INFO] Reading API signatures: /home/mdupont/experiments/elasticsearch/core-signatures.txt\n[INFO] Loading classes to check...\n[INFO] Scanning for API signatures and dependencies...\n[INFO] Scanned 4599 (and 1154 related) class file(s) for forbidden API invocations (in 5.85s), 0 error(s).\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- maven-resources-plugin:2.5:testResources (default-testResources) @ elasticsearch ---\n[debug] execute contextualize\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources.\n[INFO] Copying 166 resources\n[INFO] Copying 21 resources\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- maven-compiler-plugin:2.3.2:testCompile (default-testCompile) @ elasticsearch ---\n[INFO] Nothing to compile - all classes are up to date\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- forbiddenapis:1.3:testCheck (check-forbidden-test-apis) @ elasticsearch ---\n[INFO] Reading bundled API signatures: jdk-unsafe\n[INFO] Reading bundled API signatures: jdk-deprecated\n[INFO] Loading classes to check...\n[INFO] Scanning for API signatures and dependencies...\n[INFO] Scanned 714 (and 1503 related) class file(s) for forbidden API invocations (in 1.36s), 0 error(s).\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- maven-surefire-plugin:2.15:test (default-test) @ elasticsearch ---\n[INFO] Tests are skipped.\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- junit4-maven-plugin:2.0.10:junit4 (tests) @ elasticsearch ---\n[INFO] <JUnit4> says ciao!

All I now about is 'mvn install/compile/package/deploy'.

It slows down the build just enough that the error does not happen. It's got to be some knind of race condition. I can't provide any feedback under these circumstances, right?\n\nMy original goal in compling ESearch was to find the 90.5 version and compile it. We are having the InetAddress Serializtion issue when we compile our project with Java 1.7, since your jars and zips are compiled with 1.6. We are having to downgrade our environments to 1.6 to get them running. I was hoping to test whether compiling Esearch with 1.7 would solve the problem (or find if the problem was in a dependency fo ESearch's). \n\n \nDennis Gearon\n\nNever, ever approach a computer saying or even thinking \"I will just do this quickly.\"\n\n---\n\n From: Alexander Reelsen notifications@github.com\nTo: elasticsearch/elasticsearch elasticsearch@noreply.github.com \nCc: Dennis Gearon gearond@sbcglobal.net \nSent: Friday, October 11, 2013 1:39 AM\nSubject: Re: [elasticsearch] Lastest git master does not build clean (#3674)\n\n@kwince if you just need to create a package and rather want to ignore the tests (dont get me wrong here, reporting test failures is perfectly valid and we are happy for that), you can run the packaging process without executing the tests via mvn -DskipTests=true package (you might know that already, just wanted to make sure you know in case you just want to play with the 1.0 snapshot zip/tar.gz archive).\nAlso if you can reproduce test failures, dont bother to put in some information including the seeds, so we can reproduce it with our randomized test architecture.\n—\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/27382534","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3674#issuecomment-27382534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3674","id":27382534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzgyNTM0","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-30T11:47:40Z","updated_at":"2013-10-30T11:47:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kwince just as a reference\n\n```\ngit checkout v0.90.5\nmvn clean package -DskipTests=true\n```\n\nThat should generate the same packages than on elasticsearch.org - however it does not really matter, if you build with java6 or java7 compiler as we are setting the compiled target java version to 1.6 in the `pom.xml`. Also if you change this to 1.7 your serialization problem would not have been solved, as you still use different JVMs to communicate during runtime (and this is where the problem occurs, not on compile time).\n\nIn the meantime we have continued our efforts to stabilize the tests further. If you run the tests yourself and you reliably manage to have a failing tests, please create a new github issue for this as well - which includes the mvn call to reproduce (we need a special call, which includes all the arguments needed to create the same setup for the randomized testing, this call is logged directly above the failed assertion of a failed test - or just include the full log).\n\nThanks to everyone for helping and notifying!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
