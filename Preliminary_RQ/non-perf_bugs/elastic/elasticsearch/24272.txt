Enough that, if the cache is turned off, the script compilation limit will kick in and kill the test. You can reproduce this with `@Seed(\"1700EBAFCDE6C8B9\")` on `BulkWithUpdatesIT`.\r\n\r\nI don't know the right solution here. We could change it so the cache is never turned off 100%, but, unless we prevent that in configuration, someone is going to set up elasticsearch that way one day. And we should randomly test that.... So I think either we make 0 an invalid setting or we should update all the tests that fail when this is 0 to force it to something non-0.... Of course these are fairly difficult to debug.....\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a failure: https://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+5.3+multijob-unix-compatibility/137/os=centos/consoleFull","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
