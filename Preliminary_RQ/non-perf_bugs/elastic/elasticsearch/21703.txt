For instance, `age:>18` is equivalent to `age:{18 TO *]`. The issue however is that given that it is implemented on top of the base Lucene query parser (`<` and `>` are handled in `MapperQueryParser#getFieldQuerySingle`), they cannot be escaped like other query operators. So if you want to search for a term that starts with `<` or `>` in a `keyword` field, the only way to do so is to quote the searched term, eg. `my_field:\">value\"`.","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
