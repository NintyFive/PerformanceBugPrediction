Started ES build from master - last commit 35be46df71e5da1e840b678d8650fb012ae7305b with no data directory\n2. Response seems ok: https://gist.github.com/50ca6553b2adcd09ff51\n3. Restart ES\n4. Response is without matches from percolator: https://gist.github.com/fbaf397c8f820c6fe0d0\n\nI tried it without step 3 (restarting ES) too and result was exactly the same.
