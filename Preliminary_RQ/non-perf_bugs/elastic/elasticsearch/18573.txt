With PR #15625 we log a warning if minimum_master_nodes is set to less than a quorum of master-eligible nodes.\n\nIn the future we could not only log a warning but also add some checks to enforce that minimum_master_nodes is properly used. Updating the setting to a value that brings it down to less than a quorum of master-eligible nodes could for example be prohibited. (Note that this might need special care for the case where the cluster is down-scaled from two to one master-eligible node).\n\nLong term we could even think about preventing a node from joining a cluster and fail elections if it will bring minimum_master_nodes to an illegal value (and we're in production mode).\n","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
