The dot processor exists to help disambiguate (and handle) dot notation vs. nested object notation (the latter is the default)\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n```\r\n      \"_source\": {\r\n        \"foo.bar\": 17,\r\n        \"foo\" : {\r\n          \"bar\" : 18\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }]\r\n```\r\nIn a processor, when you reference \"foo.bar\" do you mean the value of 17 or 18 ? With the dot processor (by default) you get an array of both [17,18], with out the dot processor, it will default to only reading the nested object. \r\n\r\nHappy to discuss this further, but in the context of the issue logged (rename processor) I will close this issue. Feel free to re-open or open a new issue with ideas on how to improve the experience here. \r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/454598663","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37507#issuecomment-454598663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37507","id":454598663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDU5ODY2Mw==","user":{"login":"ycombinator","id":51061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/51061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator","html_url":"https://github.com/ycombinator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycombinator/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-16T00:01:05Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T00:01:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the explanation, @jakelandis. The current behavior makes sense, given the ambiguity problem.\r\n\r\nOne side-effect in terms of user experience is that we end up needing a lot of `dot_expander` processors, something that could be alleviated by https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/36950.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
