The problem was that homebrew didn't update itself, so homebrew didn't know the latest elasticsearch.\n\nSo I basically did:\n\nbrew update\nbrew uninstall elasticsearch\nbrew install elasticsearch   # remove and install because just trying to update it didn't do anything\n\nMake sure to restart elasticsearch too. For some reason, when I re-started elasticsearch according to instructions, the old one was still running. So I just kill -9'd the old instance and ran again. Finally bulk works again.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
