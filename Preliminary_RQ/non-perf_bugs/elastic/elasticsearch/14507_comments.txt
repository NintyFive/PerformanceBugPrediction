Maybe just RESTful principles does not fit ES API requirements.

Just create resource with representation of these operations, for example `http://localhost:9200/alias-operations` and PUT a collection of AliasOperation entities, defined as `{action: '<action>', index: '<name>', 'alias': '<name>'}`. ~~ActionOperation may have own unique ID and state of execution, and I should be able to get details about batch via `alias-operations/<id>`.~~ (EDIT) The state of single operation may be available via `alias-operations/<id>`, but this may be not required/useful.
