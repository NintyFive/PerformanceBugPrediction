The problem is that we need to add the document type in the mapping source too:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nXContentBuilder mapping = XContentFactory.jsonBuilder()\r\n    .startObject()\r\n        // define the document type\r\n        .startObject(\"elog\")\r\n            .startObject(\"properties\")\r\n                .startObject(\"_log\")\r\n                    .field(\"type\", \"text\")\r\n                .endObject()\r\n            .endObject()\r\n        .endObject()\r\n    .endObject();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the method signature (`addMapping(String type, XContentBuilder source)`) suggests that it is sufficient to just include `properties` in the mapping source and as long as you always use the transport client, this will even work. One possibility would be to add a validation (in `MetaDataIndexTemplateService`?) that the mapping is structurally correct.","closed_by":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
