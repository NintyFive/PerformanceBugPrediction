https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.x/index-modules-translog.html#_translog_settings\n\n```\nBy default, Elasticsearch fsyncs and commits the translog every 5 seconds and at the end of every index, delete, update, or bulk request. \n```\n\nI think the interval-based fsync is only useful in case you disable the per-write fsync, so it's a bit confusing to say that elasticsearch does both as it implies that the interval-based fsync is still useful when you already fsync after every write operation?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
