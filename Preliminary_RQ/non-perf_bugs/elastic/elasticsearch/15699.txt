See here: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/set-a--ttl-value-at-the-index-level/31668/3 where theuntergeek -- Aaron Mildenstein says \"there is no index-level TTL presently. There's a feature request issue out for it (I forget the number), but it has not yet been added.\"  and https://discuss.elastic.co/t/index-level-ttl-how-do-we-track-this-feature-request/37775 where warkolm (Mark Walkom) responded to my request about how to track such a feature with \"It'd be in here - https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1.  If you find it, please link it here so others can benefit :smile: (I couldn't find it!)\"\n\nI've checked in issues and features and am not finding anything.  Can someone please point me to where to track this feature request?  I'm surprised there isn't more noise about this one, since it would make index maintenance much simpler.\n\nThanks,\nCasie\n","closed_by":{"login":"eskibars","id":2246002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDYwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2246002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars","html_url":"https://github.com/eskibars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskibars/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
