The field data is loaded to memory is now controlled using different settings, called `index.fielddata.cache` which defaults to `resident`. You can set it to `soft` to retain the old usage behavior, or you can set it to:\n\n```\nindex.fielddata.cache: node\nindices.fielddata.cache.size: 30%\n```\n\n(the `30%` can also be an explicit size, like `12gb`)\n\nIn which case it will use 30% of the heap for the field data.
