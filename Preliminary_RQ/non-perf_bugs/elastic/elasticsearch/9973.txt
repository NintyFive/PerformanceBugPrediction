I've created a Play to reproduce the issue I'm seeing here - https://www.found.no/play/gist/e452c1d68d6465540d85\n\nFor two simple documents:\n## name: \"7000\"\n\nname: \"T100\"\n\nWith a simple not_analyzed mapping:\n\ntype:\n    properties: \n        name: \n            type: string\n            index: not_analyzed\n\nThe query for \"name:7_\" matches a single document (as it should), but a query for \"name:T_\" does not match a document.  I'm seeing this bug in ES versions 1.3.2 and 1.4.4.\n\nTrying various searches and documents, it appears that wildcarding starting with a numeric-looking string works, but starting with an alpha character (e.g. \"T\") fails to get any hits.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jdutton","id":2054211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTQyMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2054211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdutton","html_url":"https://github.com/jdutton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdutton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdutton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdutton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdutton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdutton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdutton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdutton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdutton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdutton/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
