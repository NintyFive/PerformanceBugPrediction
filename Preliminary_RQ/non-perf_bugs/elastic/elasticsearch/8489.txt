If you can't create an index because of low disk, that is an error. \n- It would be nice if the error returned to the client indicated the reason the index was unassigned. \n","closed_by":{"login":"ppearcy","id":307414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzQxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/307414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy","html_url":"https://github.com/ppearcy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppearcy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
