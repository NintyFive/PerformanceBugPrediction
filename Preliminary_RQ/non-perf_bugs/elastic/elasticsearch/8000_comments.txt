We always denormalize instead. See `_cat/shards` or `_cat/segments` for example.\n\nIn this case, since node attributes are such a small part of a node identity, I wonder if it doesn't make sense to have a new API, `_cat/nodeattrs` or somesuch?\n\n```\n% GET /_cat/nodeattrs\nnode    attr.name     attr.value\nn1      zone          zone2323\nn2      zone          zone8282\n```\n\nThe default could have more info, maybe `host` and `port`.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/125799145","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8000#issuecomment-125799145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8000","id":125799145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNTc5OTE0NQ==","user":{"login":"metadave","id":58244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/58244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave","html_url":"https://github.com/metadave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-29T01:30:31Z","updated_at":"2015-07-29T01:31:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1, I like how your `GET /_cat/nodeattrs` example looks\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/126095410","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8000#issuecomment-126095410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8000","id":126095410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjA5NTQxMA==","user":{"login":"metadave","id":58244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/58244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave","html_url":"https://github.com/metadave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metadave/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-29T21:05:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-29T21:05:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Node attributes are available in `_cat/nodeattrs` via #12534 \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
