Sometimes nodes start GC thrashing b/c it's not freeing up enough memory. For example:\n\n```\n[2015-03-23 17:25:53,342][INFO ][monitor.jvm              ] [Ocelot] [gc][old][212973][1077] duration [6.1s], collections [1]/[6.4s], total [6.1s]/[1.8h], memory [7.2gb]->[7.2gb]/[7.3gb], all_pools {[young] [38mb]->[188mb]/[0b]}{[survivor] [0b]->[0b]/[0b]}{[old] [7.1gb]->[7gb]/[7.3gb]}\n[2015-03-23 17:25:59,627][INFO ][monitor.jvm              ] [Ocelot] [gc][old][212974][1078] duration [6.1s], collections [1]/[6.2s], total [6.1s]/[1.8h], memory [7.2gb]->[7.1gb]/[7.3gb], all_pools {[young] [188mb]->[70mb]/[0b]}{[survivor] [0b]->[0b]/[0b]}{[old] [7gb]->[7gb]/[7.3gb]}\n```\n\nIt's all old gen. We switched from concurrent mark sweep to G1, but that didn't help. Looking at node stats while this is going on\n\ncurl http://localhost:9200/_nodes/Ocelot/stats\n\n```\n\"segments\": {\n          \"count\": 6015,\n          \"memory_in_bytes\": 909820630,  =  0.84734 GB\n          \"index_writer_memory_in_bytes\": 0,\n          \"index_writer_max_memory_in_bytes\": 1504223232,  = 1.40092 GB\n          \"version_map_memory_in_bytes\": 0,\n          \"fixed_bit_set_memory_in_bytes\": 2779968664    = 2.58905 GB\n        },\n```\n\nI noticed that fixed_bit_set_memory_in_bytes is taking up quite a large chunk of our 8GB heap and that by design it never evicts\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/7037\n\nWe use nested documents heavily. I was wondering if there's a way to control this memory usage, if this is a bug, or if we simply need more memory/nodes to cover this memory overhead. \n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
