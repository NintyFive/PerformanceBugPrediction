Instead of providing these \"opinionated features\", we'd be better of just providing the primitives required for users to implement the logic they need.\n\nWe have these primitives in 5.0:  ingest pipelines allow injecting a new timestamp at index time, delete-by-query is being moved back into core (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16883) for deletion of expired documents, and the update API allows updating the ttl and timestamp as the user sees fit.\n\nWe still need to be able to support indices created in 2.x in 5.x, but we should prevent new indices from enabling `_ttl` and `_timestamp`.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/218748986","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18280#issuecomment-218748986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18280","id":218748986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODc0ODk4Ng==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-12T12:58:02Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T12:58:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would be good to add deprecation logging in 2.x\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
