nested: NullPointerException; }]\",\n   \"status\": 500\n}\n```\n\n`lastname` mapping is as follows:\n\n``` javascript\n\"lastname\": {\n  \"type\": \"string\",\n  \"index\": \"not_analyzed\",\n  \"omit_norms\": true,\n  \"index_options\": \"docs\"\n}\n```\n\nFairly standard IMO.\n\nNow the funny thing is that I have another `name` mapping which is exactly the same and everything works just fine. From a data point of view, I cannot see a difference between one field and the other (upper case strings).\n\nThe NPE happens in `BytesRefOrdValComparator` at line 388 because `MultiDocs.ordinals()` returns `null`.\n\nNow, i don't know why `lastname` happens to use `MultiOrdinals` (or `MultiDocs` for that matter) to do sorting, but making `MultiDocs` return its `MultiOrdinals` instance seems to fix the issue, although I'm not sure whether the null pointer was intentional and the problem is somewhere else.\n\nThoughts?\n\nThanks a lot in advance.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
