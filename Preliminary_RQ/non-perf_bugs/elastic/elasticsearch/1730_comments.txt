What happens is that shutdown causes the node to go and explicitly leave the cluster, but, then, the master it leaves (if its not the master) is too fast and manages to send a ping request where the node that shutsdown still manages to answer, which causes this problem and #1731. I will push a fix with a dedicated issue for this: #1740. If you can give it a twirl as well (I managed to recreate it), it would be great and we can close these two.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/4391443","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1730#issuecomment-4391443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1730","id":4391443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTE0NDM=","user":{"login":"nkvoll","id":391931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/391931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll","html_url":"https://github.com/nkvoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nkvoll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-03-08T13:49:28Z","updated_at":"2012-03-08T13:49:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#1740 seems to have fixed this.
