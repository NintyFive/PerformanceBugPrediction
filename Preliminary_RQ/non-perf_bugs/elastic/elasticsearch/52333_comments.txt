Your report matches [the expected behavior of the default highlighter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/search-request-highlighting.html#unified-highlighter), which uses characters like `!` or `.` to determine sentence boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a user question rather than a bug, and we'd like to direct these kinds of things to the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/). If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
