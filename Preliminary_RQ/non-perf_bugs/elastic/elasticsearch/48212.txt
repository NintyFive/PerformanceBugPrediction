As you can tell from [this build](https://gradle-enterprise.elastic.co/s/wtzckil6qwe2o/tests/byProject?toggled=W1syXSxbMiwwXSxbMiwwLDBdLFsyLDAsMCwwXV0) the suite took over 19m during a successful run. Perhaps it makes sense to bump the suite timeout for this test or break it up, depending on how easy that might be.","closed_by":{"login":"mark-vieira","id":4106672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4106672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira","html_url":"https://github.com/mark-vieira","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark-vieira/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
