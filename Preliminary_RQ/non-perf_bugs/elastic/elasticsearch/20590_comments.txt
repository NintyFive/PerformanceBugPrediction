But since the aggregation may have a search query and/or filters associated with it we don't know how performant this would be. I imagine it would be more efficient to implement this option inside elasticsearch so the calculations can be done in a single request.\n\nI think there's some precedence for such an option in the terms agg. Essentially we want the `size` option from the terms agg, but for histograms.\n\nThanks for considering!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/248616170","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20590#issuecomment-248616170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20590","id":248616170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODYxNjE3MA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-21T13:42:58Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T13:42:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Duplicate of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9572\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
