have been a number of release manager failures recently because the elasticsearch build no longer producing some poms. \r\nThere's no way to write a test for this from the ES side, on the other hand we have the example plugin tests that would detect any non published dependencies ( non published transitive dependencies of published artifacts ) - but only if these don't generate a pom. These tests will not detect if the upload of the artifacts is not performed. \r\n\r\nAs such , the following proposal:\r\n  - have a yaml description in a file in the ES repo \r\n  - the es build will:   \r\n       - make sure no project has publishing applied other than the ones in the file \r\n       - apply publishing for all project in the file \r\n  - release manager will \r\n       - configure all maven publications based on this file\r\n\r\nThis will also make the testing of the plugin build more effective. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
