However, a combination of force=true and waitIfOngoing=false (default value) makes nonsense as that force flush will be ignored if there's an ongoing flush.\r\n\r\n@jpountz [suggests](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/36188#pullrequestreview-181145369) replacing these two parameters with an enum of flush purposes:\r\n\r\n- `TRY_FLUSH` equals `force=false` and `waitIfOngoing=false`\r\n- `FLUSH_IF_CHANGES` equals `force=false` and `waitIfOngoing=true`\r\n- `FORCE_FLUSH` equals `force=true` and `waitIfOngoing=true`\r\n\r\nNote that this is a breaking change. Another option is always to execute a force flush regardless of the value of waitIfOngoing.","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
