Minor fixes here that I can think of are \r\n\r\n1. Make the test wait until the task state is set before sending the rethrottle command. It's easy to imagine client applications running into problems here, so I'd like it to be more resilient\r\n2. Make the rethrottle action wait until the task's state is set before continuing, or timeout. I'm not a huge fan of this strategy, although I can't really articulate any good reasons why\r\n3. Let it perform a rethrottle on the task, and if the state isn't set yet, \"store\" that rethrottle and apply it later at the time the task state is set. This is closest to the old behavior but maybe could be more confusing\r\n\r\nAll of these still have the issue where the task may have operations performed on it before its state is set, which didn't happen in the old behavior. The way to get around this, which would be a major change, would to be have it always set the task as leader when slices is `auto`. \r\n\r\nI'll try one of these minor ones first and see if that's satisfactory, and if not make the major
