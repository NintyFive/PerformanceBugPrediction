This was done since the keyservers are slow to return the key and thus the docker builds would fail. Additionally, the process of uploading checksums to the repository was done since Tini did not releases checksums.\r\n\r\nWith the merging of https://github.com/krallin/tini/pull/156 and the closing of https://github.com/krallin/tini/issues/153, Tini now publishes their checksums on their Github releases. Checksums are now available from version `v0.19.0`.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the addition of Tiniâ€™s checksums, I think Elasticsearch should move away from uploading checksums and utilize the official checksums from Tini. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome advantages of moving to this approach are:\r\n\r\n- Elastic does not need to keep uploading new checksums for new versions of Tini\r\n- Verifying the checksums can be done fully in the Dockerfile without copying additional files\r\n- Updating to a new version of Tini would pretty seamless. Would only need to change the version of Tini inside the Dockerfile\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pugnascotia","id":8696382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTYzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8696382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia","html_url":"https://github.com/pugnascotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pugnascotia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
