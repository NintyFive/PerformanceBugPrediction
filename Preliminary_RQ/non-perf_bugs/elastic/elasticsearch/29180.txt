It has some different use cases than Logstash, and is quite popular in some sectors. \r\n\r\nIt has some NiFi community maintained processors for interacting with Elasticsearch, but per feedback from Elasticon, some folks who have considered NiFi have decided not to use it due to gaps between the currently available Elasticsearch processors and the current code baselines and implementation standards.\r\n\r\nElastic is uniquely positioned to produce and maintain an optimized set of official NiFi processors for the Elastic stack. I'm requesting that Elastic look at maintaining a set of NiFi processors as a freely distributed NAR (Nifi archive package) with the most up to date Elastic APIs, flexibility in interfacing with various Elastic stack components, etc.\r\n\r\nSpecific processors might include Elasticsearch bulk indexing, query, scanning, etc. A \"nifi beats\" processor could produce valuable auditing information for nifi clusters that could route through logstash/etc. Outputs for alerting from X-Pack could be valuable as well.\r\n\r\n@tris325","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
