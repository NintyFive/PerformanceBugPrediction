This might (for example) be an issue with your index template so you should check your Filebeat configuration / start from a fresh configuration and check whether this still reproduces.\r\n\r\nIf your problem persists I suggest that you [open a topic in the Filebeat Discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/beats/filebeat). The Beats team is active there as well and can help out resolving this.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
