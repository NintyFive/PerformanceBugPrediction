Realize this is not the Python client github repo - but I believe this needs support upstream (unless I am missing an available flag already implemented).\n\nThis bulk process contains a mix of index, updates and deletes.\n\nRight now, if the batch contains anything other than an 'index' (sourced from a large input file row by row) I need to try/except error catch any delete/update as a **single** API call in case a document is being deleted/updated doesn't exist.  Essentially bypassing the bulk process.  For millions of rows, this is obviously not optimal.\n\nNeed an \"ignore missing document\" flag in bulk to ignore errors when id not found for update/delete.  (unless I am missing this flag in the docs somewhere..
