This lives on to this day in the default config and results in a good deal of log noise sometimes. For instance, an exception thrown in an implementation of `TransportMasterNodeAction#masterOperation` results in a retry or else it is propagated back to the caller but is also logged at `DEBUG` level, complete with stack trace, by `TransportMasterNodeAction` on the way past:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/96b4f3df9067d579bf7e22e09613ea94f4f05462/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/support/master/TransportMasterNodeAction.java#L155-L166\r\n\r\nIt seems odd to single out this one package for `DEBUG`-level logs; these days many actions are in other packages (e.g. within `org.elasticsearch.xpack.*`). Do we still see value in this being part of the out-of-the-box default config? I think we should move to not emitting any `DEBUG`-level logs by default.","closed_by":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
