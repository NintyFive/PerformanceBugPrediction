If we're going to add new features, we prefer to add primitives that users can combine to achieve their higher level goals.  This is a high level feature, which means that 10 users will want to do things in 11 different ways. The primitives already exist in Elasticsearch to implement this feature.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
