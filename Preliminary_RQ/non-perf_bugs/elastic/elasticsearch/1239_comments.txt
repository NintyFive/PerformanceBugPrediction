Certainly could be done with a custom Appender, but I wanted an approach where I don't have to touch the source applications (for various reasons).  ElasticSearch itself is an example: I'd have to update LogConfigurator to know about my new appender in order to use it.  The main reason is 3rd-party software or apps developed by other teams where organizational friction makes this the easier approach :-)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/2020782","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1239#issuecomment-2020782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1239","id":2020782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjA3ODI=","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-09-06T18:41:51Z","updated_at":"2011-09-06T18:41:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I see, then it possibly make sense, though, since rivers can move between nodes in the cluster, I guess you will need to pin them down.
