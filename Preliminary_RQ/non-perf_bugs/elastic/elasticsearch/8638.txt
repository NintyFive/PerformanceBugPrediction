However, it doesn't support query + filter, which works in most other parts of ES.\n\nCurrently, `function_score` takes either a filter OR a query, but not both. Allowing support for both query and filter would be good because:\n1. It would align better with the rest of ES (it took me a while to figure out why the filter wasn't applied).
