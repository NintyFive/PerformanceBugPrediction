I'm not sure why it was there - but not to critical, elasticsearch lets you do it.\n\n```\nPOST -2016.12.12/test\n{\n  \"name\":\"abc\"\n}\n```\n\nI tried to delete these indices by issuing\n `DELETE -2016.*`\n\nThe problem is that this was interpreted as \n`DELETE everything except for indices starting with 2016.`\nwhich basically means delete the entire database - and after a few poignant seconds, that's what it did. \n\nI have since become acquainted with https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-index.html and the ability to include or exclude indices with the + or - operator, but it seems that this is more dangerous than useful, at least if you are unfortunate enough to have indices that start with -.\n\nI understand that it's a \"feature\", but it doesn't seems practically so useful.  Perhaps there could be a special query string for DELETE like \"wildcard=inclusive\" or \"=exclusive\"...  As it is now, I'm not even sure how I would delete the indices that start with \"-2016.\"  I can't do \"+-2016.*\"\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
