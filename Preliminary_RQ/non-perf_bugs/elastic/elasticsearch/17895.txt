There is some kind of overlap between ingest and scripts: scripts are much more flexible (and safe with painless) but for people that get familiar with ingest it may be more convenient to reuse defined pipelines. Also some of  the enrichments made through ingest are not easily performed using scripts (think geoip). \n\nWe can debate that ingest enrichments are really meant to be executed pre-indexing. But while we are reindexing a document, which is what the update api does, maybe it would be handy to be able to use ingest pipelines as well? Or maybe this is a bad idea at all and it would introduce yet another way to update documents other than scripts and partial document. I am on the fence on this myself, would be good to discuss this.\n\nThis [comment](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/16808#issuecomment-212485004) made me think about this. Not sure ingest would help there though.\n","closed_by":{"login":"talevy","id":388837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/388837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy","html_url":"https://github.com/talevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/talevy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
