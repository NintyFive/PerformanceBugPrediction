This will allow for better data consistency. \r\n\r\nThe overall requirements for this flag should probably be as follows:\r\n\r\n`wait_for_checkpoint` should be its own flag, separate from `force` and `wait_for_completion`. \r\n\r\n* `wait_for_completion`: can be used with any other flag and indicates if we wait for the task to go away before returning to the listener or not. Essentially sync vs async.\r\n* `force`: has to be used if the task is failed\r\n* `wait_for_checkpoint`: cannot be used on a failed task since the indexer cannot continue, this flag makes no sense for a failed task. Its value should just be ignored on a failed task.\r\n\r\nAs for the default value for each of them, I think the following makes sense:\r\n`force: false`\r\n`wait_for_completion: false`\r\n`wait_for_checkpoint: true`\r\n\r\nThis means that if a user wants to stop a checkpoint, but has noticed that it has stayed int he `STOPPING` state for a long time, they can use `_stop?wait_for_checkpoint=false` to cause it to stop.\r\n\r\nThis will most likely require a new `DataFrameTransformTaskState` state of `STOPPING` so that the transform can signal a `stop` when `ClientDataFrameIndexer#onFinish` is called.","closed_by":{"login":"benwtrent","id":4357155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTcxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4357155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent","html_url":"https://github.com/benwtrent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benwtrent/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
