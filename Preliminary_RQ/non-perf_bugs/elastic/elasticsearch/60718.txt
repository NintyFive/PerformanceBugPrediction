They accept the `?local` parameter and passes this to the `ClusterStateAction` but this parameter has no effect on the `IndicesStatsAction`. This is surprising, because `GET _cat/shards?local` and `GET _cat/indices?local` look like they might be completely local calls but in fact they still depend on every data node in the cluster.\r\n\r\nI think the `?local` parameter does not make sense on these APIs and we should remove it.\r\n\r\nRelates #50088 which is the same issue for `GET _cat/nodes`.","closed_by":{"login":"danhermann","id":22777892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzc3ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22777892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann","html_url":"https://github.com/danhermann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
