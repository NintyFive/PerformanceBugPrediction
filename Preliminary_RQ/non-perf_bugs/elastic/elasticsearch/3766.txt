I am using elasticsearch as the output of logstash, in an embedded fashion. I am observing high CPU utilization ( > 85%) constantly when the index size grows beyond a point. \n\nA simple script is dumping log messages at a high rate and the index soon grows pretty big. At some point (not sure about when it takes off), but whats interesting to note is after this point even if the logs stop, the CPU utilization stays high. Is this a known issue?\n\nNOTE : This is an elasticsearch cluster with a single node. JVM version 1.6.0_27\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
