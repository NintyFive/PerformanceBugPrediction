I don't understand why you are talking about two different versions of Elasticsearch  (2.2 and 5.4 + in the docs you refer to 5.5). The version numbers of (transport) client and server always need to match and API calls that work with one major version do not necessarily work with another one. \r\n\r\nWe also reserve Github for bug reports and feature requests only. Please ask questions like these in the [Elasticsearch forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) instead. Thank you!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
