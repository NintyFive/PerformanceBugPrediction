The class `IndicesFilterCache` sets `concurrencyLevel` to a hardcoded 16:\n\n``` java\nprivate void buildCache() {\n    CacheBuilder<WeightedFilterCache.FilterCacheKey, DocIdSet> cacheBuilder = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()\n            .removalListener(this)\n            .maximumWeight(sizeInBytes).weigher(new WeightedFilterCache.FilterCacheValueWeigher());\n\n    // defaults to 4, but this is a busy map for all indices, increase it a bit\n    cacheBuilder.concurrencyLevel(16);\n\n    if (expire != null) {\n        cacheBuilder.expireAfterAccess(expire.millis(), TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\n    }\n\n    cache = cacheBuilder.build();\n}\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/9ed34b5a9e9769b1264bf04d9b9a674794515bc6/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/indices/cache/filter/IndicesFilterCache.java#L116\n\nIn the Guava libraries, the eviction code is as follows:\n\n``` java\nvoid evictEntries() {\n    if (!map.evictsBySize()) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    drainRecencyQueue();\n    while (totalWeight > maxSegmentWeight) {\n        ReferenceEntry<K, V> e = getNextEvictable();\n        if (!removeEntry(e, e.getHash(), RemovalCause.SIZE)) {\n            throw new AssertionError();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/source/browse/guava/src/com/google/common/cache/LocalCache.java#2659\n\nSince `totalWeight` is an `int` and `maxSegmentWeight` is a `long` set to `maxWeight / concurrencyLevel`, when `maxWeight` is 32GB or above, then the value of `maxSegmentWeight` will be set to  above the maximum value of `int` and the check \n\n``` java\nwhile (totalWeight > maxSegmentWeight) {\n```\n\nwill always fail.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/43833893","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6268#issuecomment-43833893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6268","id":43833893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODMzODkz","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-22T00:22:51Z","updated_at":"2014-05-22T00:22:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wow, good catch!
