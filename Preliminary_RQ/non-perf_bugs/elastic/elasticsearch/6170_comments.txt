The maven shade plugin is a viable solution but it's hardly elegant. At a minimum, I would hope ES would provide a client only dependency that allowed users to interact with the Client interface (Transport or otherwise) without bringing in all of the Lucene dependencies. The big win here is that ES does the packaging and it's one less thing we need to maintain locally in our own source repo. \n\nWhether this new module uses the Shade plugin to hide Lucene or perhaps removes Lucene is largely an implementation detail. We could debate the merits of a smaller dependency tree as a separate issue. As it stands now, if you have a component like Apache Jackrabbit then you're unable to use ES in your application in any capacity without the shade plugin. Again, I can roll my own (which I have) but I don't want to have to continue to do this.\n\nI think this issue is worth addressing.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/160832543","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6170#issuecomment-160832543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6170","id":160832543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDgzMjU0Mw==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-01T02:55:07Z","updated_at":"2015-12-01T02:55:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"May be it's the same issue as https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7743?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/165953212","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6170#issuecomment-165953212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6170","id":165953212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTk1MzIxMg==","user":{"login":"matt-blanchette","id":4365537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjU1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4365537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette","html_url":"https://github.com/matt-blanchette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-blanchette/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-19T06:24:15Z","updated_at":"2015-12-19T06:24:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1 for Java client with few dependencies\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/249834070","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6170#issuecomment-249834070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6170","id":249834070,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTgzNDA3MA==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T11:04:12Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T11:04:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't think we are planning on doing this with a transport client.
