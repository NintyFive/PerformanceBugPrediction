For users already using x-pack an upgrade via OS package manager like yum or apt-get does not remove x-pack plugin before installing ES 6.3. This leads to an issue where node does not start and following exception is logged:\r\n```\r\n[2018-06-15T10:28:26,252][ERROR][o.e.b.Bootstrap ] Exception\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Duplicate key org.elasticsearch.plugins.PluginsService$Bundle@24a783dd\r\nat java.util.stream.Collectors.lambda$throwingMerger$0(Collectors.java:133) ~[?:1.8.0_171]\r\nat java.util.HashMap.merge(HashMap.java:1254) ~[?:1.8.0_171] \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo recover from it one need to:\r\n * remove x-pack `/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin remove x-pack`\r\n * append log4j config of x-pack to the main one: `cat /etc/elasticsearch/x-pack/log4j2.properties >> /etc/elasticsearch/log4j2.properties`\r\n * move x-pack config files from `/etc/elasticsearch/x-pack` to `/etc/elasticsearch`\r\n\r\nCan we have an [upgrade document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/rolling-upgrades.html) updated to explicitly reflect additional steps when upgrading to 6.3?
