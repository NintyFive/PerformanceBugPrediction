scripting module's example for using on-disk scripts suggests that users should use \"script\" and supply the script's name, but the \"file\" is a much better and clearer choice for on-disk scripts:\n\n``` json\n          \"script_score\": {\n            \"script\": \"calculate-score\",\n            \"params\": {\n              \"my_modifier\": 8\n            }\n          }\n```\n\nworks, but it should be the much clearer:\n\n``` json\n          \"script_score\": {\n            \"file\": \"calculate-score\",\n            \"lang\" : \"groovy\",\n            \"params\":
