It duplicates effort and increases the likelihood of error.\r\n\r\nInstead, docbooks generated from the elastic/elasticsearch repo should use the shared stack version file in the elastic/docs repo.\r\n\r\nAs the elastic/docs repo is already required to build any docbooks, this would not introduce any new repo-cloning requirements. The process for building Elasticsearch dobooks would not change.\r\n\r\nRelates to elastic/docs#804.\r\n\r\n## Proposed plan\r\n\r\n1. Include the stack version file in the `$ES_REPO_ROOT/doc/Versions.asciidoc` file. As of writing, this impacts the following docbooks:\r\n\r\n    * [ Java REST Client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/master/index.html)\r\n    * [Painless Scripting Language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/master/index.html)\r\n    * [Elasticsearch Plugins and Integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/master/index.html)\r\n    * [Elasticsearch Reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/index.html)\r\n\r\n2. Remove the following attributes from the `$ES_REPO_ROOT/doc/Versions.asciidoc` file, back to the last supported version:\r\n    * `version`, which displays the current Elasticsearch version in several example snippets\r\n    * `bare_version`, which is used similarly to the `version` attribute but does not include `-alpha` or `-beta`\r\n    * `major_version`, which is the `version` in a n.x format (e.g. 7.x)\r\n    * `prev-major-version`, which is the laster `version` in a n.x format (e.g. 7.x)\r\n    * `branch`, which is used during the doc build\r\n    * `release-state`, which determines whether a [preliminary note](https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/lib/ES/Book.pm#L22) displays.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing forward, docs release managers will update these attributes in the appropriate \r\nstack version file as part of the release process.\r\n\r\nES dev release managers will continue updating the Elasticsearch `Versions.asciidoc` file as today.","closed_by":{"login":"jrodewig","id":40268737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjY4NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40268737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrodewig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrodewig/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
