Unfortunately the resulting project will not build out of the box, mostly because of two issues:\n- use of (forbidden/unaccessible) Unsafe/CAS by the in-tree jsr166 classes\n- runtime check for enabled assertions results in an error about:\n  \"Possible accidental assignment in place of a comparison. A condition expression should not be reduced to an assignment\"\n\nThe maven goal can add per-project compiler flags to reduce these errors to warnings/ignore them. The same goes for the other >4000 warnings (mostly generics, unused imports, dead code, deprecations etc. - see separate issue)\n\nWhether these two in particular should be warnings or outright ignored is an open issue. The jsr166 code should not be touched as it's a straight import from the jsr166 repository and should remain as pristine as possible for tracking upstream changes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
