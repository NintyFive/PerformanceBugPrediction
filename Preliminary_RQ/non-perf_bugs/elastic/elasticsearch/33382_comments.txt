We are also in the process of replacing function_score with a scripting context that would make applying decays easy. We still think it would be nice to have both since they have different trade-offs: scripts would be more flexible but slower since they can't skip non-competitive hits like these new queries can.\r\n\r\nOne open question left is whether we should have 1 or 3 different queries to handle boosting numbers, dates and geo-points. The main issue is that these queries take a pivot distance as a parameter that would be a number for numeric fields, a duration for date fields and a geo distance for geo-point fields.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
