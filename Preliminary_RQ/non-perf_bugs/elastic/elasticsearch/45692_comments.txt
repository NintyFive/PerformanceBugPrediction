If you can stop by there, we'd appreciate it. This allows us to use GitHub for verified bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/\\) that should be able to help get an answer to your question. As such, I hope you don't mind that I close this.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said a quick pointer:\r\n* You can only run a single snapshot at a time. Concurrently running multiple ones will fail in the way you posted above.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
