I apologize in advance for posting here, but I can't seem to find a dedicated ElasticSearch forum associated with elasticsearch.org!?\n\nYes. See http://www.elasticsearch.org/community\nBetter ask there.\n\nWhat elasticsearch tries to do is to create a tmp file on the repository and then try to read it from all the data nodes forming the cluster and then remove the file.\nIt most likely fails at one of those steps.\n\nYou should try to do the same from all nodes with the user which is running elasticsearch and see how it goes. Note that you could skip the verification using `?verify=false` IIRC.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
