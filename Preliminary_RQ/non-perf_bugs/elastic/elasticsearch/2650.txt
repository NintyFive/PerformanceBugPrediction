Two types of distributors are supported. The `least_used` distributor always selects the directory with the most available space. The `random` distributor selects directories at random. The probability of selecting a particular directory is proportional to amount of available space in this directory.\n## Original Request\n\nWhen using multiple data directories all on different hard disks, if a new disk is added later on with 0% capacity used, then all ElasticSearch insertions will using this new disk until it is even with the others. This causes a large I/O load on the single disk and leaves the others untouched. Even worse, other processes that also share that new disk, such as Hadoop processes, end up being I/O blocked whenever they need to access it.\n\nIf a way to configure ElasticSearch to randomly select a data directory to write new data to was created, then the I/O load could still be distributed across all disks when new disks are added in.\n\nHadoop does random disk selection until a disk becomes almost full in which case it is excluded from the random selection. I think this is a good strategy but even just random all the time would prevent the new disk I/O problem.\n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
