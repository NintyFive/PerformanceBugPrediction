The problem with `ParallelCompositeReader` is that it doesn't extend `FilterDirectoryReader` and the we can't extract the shardId from the IndexReader. This is unlike other reader implementations (`AssertingDirectoryReader`) returned by this method.\r\n\r\nI'll remove the `LuceneTestCase#wrapReader(...)` wrapping for now in these tests.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/297923740","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24343#issuecomment-297923740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/24343","id":297923740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzkyMzc0MA==","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-28T07:01:48Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T07:01:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This commit fixed these build failures: ebe98f9d621291717a68b1719aef48cfd4a4e469","performed_via_github_app":null}]
