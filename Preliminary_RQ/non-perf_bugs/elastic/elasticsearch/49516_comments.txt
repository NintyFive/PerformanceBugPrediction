For our context/ knowledge it would be helpful to hear more details of the use case:\r\n* How would the log normal distribution be used as part of scoring? I would guess that its probability density function could be helpful as a decay function.\r\n* Why can't it be implemented using pre-existing Painless functions? I think we already have the right building blocks to represent the PDF, just want to check I'm not missing some subtlety here.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/592801324","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49516#issuecomment-592801324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49516","id":592801324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MjgwMTMyNA==","user":{"login":"jtibshirani","id":7461306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjEzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7461306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani","html_url":"https://github.com/jtibshirani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtibshirani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-29T01:16:02Z","updated_at":"2020-02-29T01:16:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@sherry-ger just pinging again about the questions above.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/623334392","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49516#issuecomment-623334392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/49516","id":623334392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzMzNDM5Mg==","user":{"login":"danielmitterdorfer","id":1699576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTk1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1699576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/danielmitterdorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielmitterdorfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-04T08:39:46Z","updated_at":"2020-05-04T08:39:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No further feedback received. @sherry-ger if you have the requested\r\ninformation please add it in a comment and we can look at re-opening\r\nthis issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
