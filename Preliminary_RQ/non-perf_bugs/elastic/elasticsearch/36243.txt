In particular, because Node.js just released security updates that [reject response headers over 8192 bytes](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/november-2018-security-releases/), its likely a significant number of users of Node.js will now see issues due to those headers.\r\n\r\nHopefully, that will lead to them fixing the issues raised by the deprecation warnings! :)\r\n\r\nHowever, in some cases, it's not feasible to fix the warnings immediately. In my case, I maintain an open source project ([the Pelias geocoder](https://github.com/pelias/pelias/)), where we are currently migrating from Elasticsearch 2 to 5. We can't fix the deprecation warnings until we drop support for ES2, and we can't drop that support right away.\r\n\r\nWhile there are [discussions](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33508) about setting a default to the number of warnings returned, even having the option to set that limit would be enough for now. I understand that setting new default config options might not be possible on older releases that are technically only getting bugfixes, and no behavior changes would be allowed.\r\n\r\nLet me know if backporting this change is possible or if there is another solution.
