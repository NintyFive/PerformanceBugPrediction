In other words, 5.x indices with `_all` explicitly enabled will continue to work in 6.0 as before, while indices with `_all` not explicitly enabled will lose `_all` fields and will start to use our fallback mechanism for all fields queries. \r\n\r\nAfter discussions with @archanid and @dakrone we couldn't come to a clear conclusion on how this situation should be handled. We see at least 2 options here. \r\n\r\n1) It can be fixed by updating all existing 5.x mappings to have `_all` explicitly enabled when the first 6.0 node shows up in the cluster. \r\n\r\n2) Alternatively we can just update our [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/breaking_60_mappings_changes.html#_the_literal__all_literal_meta_field_is_now_disabled_by_default) that doesn't seem to explicitly say what happens to the existing mappings. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
