I don't think this is a bug, the problem is that by removing all whitespaces in your first escaped example you're creating sections like this one:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\\"filter\\\":{{{#line_no}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n=> tripple mustache with a section start.\r\n\r\nif you simple add whitespaces at the beginning of your two section starts to prevent the tripple mustache there it all works fine via:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"{\\\"query\\\":{\\\"bool\\\":{\\\"must\\\":{\\\"match\\\":{\\\"line\\\":\\\"{{text}}\\\"}},\\\"filter\\\":{
