I would only expect `+_type:__nested1` to be cached by the bitset filter cache. \r\n\r\nI think this is not intended and if many different nested sort filter where to be specified in separate search requests then this could cause the bitset filter cache to consume a lot of jvm heap space.\r\n\r\nThe problem is in `SortBuilder` class line 251 where this happens: `context.bitsetFilter(parentQuery)`\r\nand in the case of multi level sorting `parentQuery` could be set to the nested filter of the parent nested sort definition.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how this can be best be fixed. I'm opening this issue to track the problem.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
