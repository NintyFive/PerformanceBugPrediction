It looks like one spec_id corresponds to a set of requests.  Is it possible to have multiple \"spec_id\"s in a single API call?  If not, could we drop it to remove a layer of hierarchy in the request.\"\n\n[We discussed](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20231#issuecomment-244368225) allowing to compare more than one query configuration already way back in the past.\n\na) I think this could be easily modeled by asking the user to submit more than one rank eval request.\nb) In it's current form I think this id isn't particularly useful.\n\nTo conclude I think it makes sense to just drop it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
