This issue results from a change in the way we serialize and parse lucene versions  ( changed inhttps://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/7584/files#diff-6debabcebb4a810f1be417d16c41c115R140 ). The change is compatible with ES 1.3.1 since the parsing there was improved due to another issue ( https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/pull/7055 ). \n\nAt the moment, I can only think of 2  solutions:\n- you can ignore these errors and continue the upgrade. The shards will be allocated as soon as the primary is assigned to a 1.4.2 (once all nodes with current copies have been upgraded). The down side is that your indices will be temporally red (indexing may stall, and searches will return partial data in that time)\n- do a rolling upgrade to 1.3.8, where this is not an issue and from there upgrade to 1.4.3 .\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/74439022","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9704#issuecomment-74439022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9704","id":74439022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDM5MDIy","user":{"login":"HenrikOssipoff","id":4737224,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzcyMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4737224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenrikOssipoff","html_url":"https://github.com/HenrikOssipoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenrikOssipoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenrikOssipoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenrikOssipoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenrikOssipoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenrikOssipoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenrikOssipoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenrikOssipoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenrikOssipoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenrikOssipoff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-15T21:49:27Z","updated_at":"2015-02-15T21:49:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for getting back to me on this.\n\nWe will attempt to do a rolling upgrade (or rather, downgrade I guess) of 1.3.8 on all nodes, and from there do an upgrade to 1.4.3.\n\nWhile I know this is very conditional of which version you are running, this should likely be marked as a breaking change in the appropriate version -- in case someone else tries to do an upgrade from 1.3.0 to 1.4.3.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/74439209","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9704#issuecomment-74439209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9704","id":74439209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDM5MjA5","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-15T21:53:09Z","updated_at":"2015-02-15T22:34:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@HenrikOssipoff yeah, I agree it's tricky. This is why I left it open for further thought. \n\nNote that if you have successfully indexed any document into a shard created on the 1.4.2 node you will not be able to downgrade it. You can close the index in question and reopen once the whole procedure is completed.
