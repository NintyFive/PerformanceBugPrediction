Master nodes, like data nodes, should all be of similar quality, otherwise if one \"better\" master node fails, then another \"worse\" master node tries to take over, you could end up just crashing your cluster regardless.\n\nDedicated master nodes make sense once your cluster is big enough.  They can use cheaper, smaller hardware than the data nodes.  Alternatively, you can also run two instances of elasticsearch on each box: one as dedicated data, and one as dedicated master, with a much smaller heap.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/139025550","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12778#issuecomment-139025550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12778","id":139025550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTAyNTU1MA==","user":{"login":"charlesmims","id":3018003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTgwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3018003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims","html_url":"https://github.com/charlesmims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T19:45:40Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T19:47:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I disagree with this assessment.  For situations where data nodes are huge beefy boxes, adding the duty of temporarily being master in addition to being a data node shouldn't cause instability unless the data node is already running close to its limits.  At any rate there are countless design decisions like this that elasticsearch admins need to account for already.  I'm probably not the only admin who wants a way to have a dedicated master and be able to survive failure of that master without dedicated backup masters and without having to restart a node to get the cluster back to the original master.\n\nHow is running two instances on one machine, one as a dedicated master and one as dedicated data preferable to allowing a data node to temporarily take over as master in the event that a master node goes down?  If you're suggesting that it should be done this way because you would implement it with enough memory set aside for a master instance and reduced memory for the data instance, this isn't any better than having dedicated backup master machines.\n\nThe guys in elasticsearch irc chat seemed to think this would be a good feature, can we put it to a vote or something rather than just closing it?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/139026682","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12778#issuecomment-139026682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12778","id":139026682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTAyNjY4Mg==","user":{"login":"charlesmims","id":3018003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTgwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3018003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims","html_url":"https://github.com/charlesmims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T19:50:30Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T19:50:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Another benefit of being able to specify a master is eliminating downtime while a new master is elected, when doing rolling restarts to upgrade, for example.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/141690575","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12778#issuecomment-141690575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12778","id":141690575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTY5MDU3NQ==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-19T17:22:31Z","updated_at":"2015-09-19T17:22:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> How is running two instances on one machine, one as a dedicated master and one as dedicated data preferable to allowing a data node to temporarily take over as master in the event that a master node goes down? \n\nWhile it's true that the master and data nodes share the risk of server failures, using two separate processes protects the master from any data/search related pressure (mostly memory and GC). We try to keep things as simple as possible because as you say, there is a lot an admin needs to worry about it. We feel this is a simpler and less error prone solution.\n\n> Another benefit of being able to specify a master is eliminating downtime while a new master is elected, when doing rolling restarts to upgrade, for example.\n\nI a fully agree that a clean master step down API will be handy to have a planned master shutdown go without any service hick up. It's own are radar but at the moment, there are other things higher up on the list - for example, shorten the 3s master election so if a master goes down (planned or not) a new master will be more quickly elected.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/166735226","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12778#issuecomment-166735226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12778","id":166735226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjczNTIyNg==","user":{"login":"charlesmims","id":3018003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTgwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3018003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims","html_url":"https://github.com/charlesmims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesmims/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-22T21:33:48Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T21:33:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Another use-case for this feature:\nUpgrading masters and rolling restarts could be less harrowing than shutting down the current master and hoping master election works.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
