Unfortunately, `groupId` does not appear in the final artifact's name, so it is good practice to make the `artifactId` unique enough that you are not going to get conflicts when it is consumed.  Your suggestions will result in jar names like `rest-client.jar`, `rest-client-sniffer.jar`, and `transport-client.jar`.
