\n\nBased on #4092 and the below snippet, it appears that the correct behavior is to not remove stop words for versions on or after 1.0.0.Beta1.\n\n```\nSTANDARD(CachingStrategy.ELASTICSEARCH) { // we don't do stopwords anymore from 1.0Beta on\n    @Override\n    protected Analyzer create(Version version) {\n        if (version.onOrAfter(Version.V_1_0_0_Beta1)) {\n            return new StandardAnalyzer(version.luceneVersion, CharArraySet.EMPTY_SET);\n        }\n        return new StandardAnalyzer(version.luceneVersion);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe inconsistency here is due to the fact that when an analyzer name isn't specified in the query params, the analyzer isn't being resolved from the pre-built analyzers, but instead from Lucene.STANDARD_ANALYZER which is configured to use stop words.\n\nPerhaps it should be resolved from the pre-built analyzers instead.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/43435971","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5974#issuecomment-43435971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5974","id":43435971,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDM1OTcx","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-18T10:06:09Z","updated_at":"2014-05-18T10:06:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
