Why would you define a runtime field without knowing what it should emit? The put mappings API would need to be used to update the script anyways later, and with the same API you can define the same field once you know what values it needs to emit, without defining it first as a placeholder?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/694365036","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62407#issuecomment-694365036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/62407","id":694365036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NDM2NTAzNg==","user":{"login":"cjcenizal","id":1238659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg2NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1238659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal","html_url":"https://github.com/cjcenizal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjcenizal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-17T16:56:02Z","updated_at":"2020-09-17T16:56:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@javanna You're right, I was mostly thinking that you'd want to be able to create a placeholder when defining a runtime field on a query, and that allowing it there would be inconsistent with disallowing it when defining it on the index. But that inconsistency is overshadowed by designing the API for the specific use-case at hand, and I can't think of a situation where you'd deliberately want to specify a placeholder runtime field on an index template or index.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
