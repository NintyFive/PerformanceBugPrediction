Currently what is reported in the GET mapping API is content that can be passed to the PUT mapping api so adding a derived property like \"auto_created\" would lose some of that symmetry.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what you can do today, we do log which templates were in effect when an index is created so a diff of the contents of that template and the current index mapping would give you an indication of which fields were introduced by dynamic mapping.\r\n\r\nAnother way of introspecting the growth of a mapping in more detail is to make use of the \"exists\" query in aggregations. Using [this example](https://gist.github.com/markharwood/45b8d66778322e26f5891c96cd060592) you can see when the field `foo` was first introduced. The same syntax could be used for all fields in a mapping to plot a timeline of when fields were introduced.\r\n\r\nOn balance, with these available workarounds and the difficulties in adding \"autocreated\" to the mapping definition we're not sure that the proposed feature is something we want to take forward.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
