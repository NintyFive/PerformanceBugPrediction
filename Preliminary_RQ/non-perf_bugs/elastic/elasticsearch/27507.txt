I've made a post on here\r\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/t/504-gateway-errors-when-using-postings-highlighter/108774\r\n\r\nHowever I'm thinking this may be a genuine issue. If I remove the highlighter elastic sends back some results. I even changed to use fast vector by specifying offsets option in the index but that hasn;t worked either.\r\n\r\nHere is the actual query:\r\n\r\nGET test/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"size\": 500, \r\n   \"highlight\":{\r\n      \"pre_tags\":[\r\n         \"<mark>\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"post_tags\":[\r\n         \"</mark>\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"order\":\"score\",\r\n      \"fields\":{\r\n         \"content.plain\":{\r\n            \"fragment_size\":150,\r\n            \"no_match_size\":150,\r\n            \"number_of_fragments\":1,\r\n            \"matched_fields\":[\r\n               \"content.plain\"\r\n            ]\r\n         },\r\n         \"title.plain\":{\r\n            \"pre_tags\":[\r\n               \"<b>\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"post_tags\":[\r\n               \"</b>\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"fragment_size\":300,\r\n            \"number_of_fragments\":0,\r\n            \"matched_fields\":[\r\n               \"title.plain\"\r\n            ]\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   },\r\n   \"query\": {\r\n            \"multi_match\":{\r\n                        \"type\":\"most_fields\",\r\n                        \"query\":\"BAR AND DEN AND 2004A\",\r\n                        \"operator\":\"and\",\r\n                        \"fields\":[\r\n                           \"content\"\r\n                        ]\r\n                     }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt seems the page size and highlighter are both playing a role in the 504 gateway errors. Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated as this is happening on a live service.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
