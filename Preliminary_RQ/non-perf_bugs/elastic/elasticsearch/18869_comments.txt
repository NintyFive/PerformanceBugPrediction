Sorry about that. Then it could be the analyzers producing tokens for your fields that don't match up with _all. That is one of the problems. I'd try to use the [analyze](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-analyze.html) API to track it down.\n\nIt _probably_ isn't a bug so much as a known limitation so this conversation ought to move to discuss.elastic.co.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
