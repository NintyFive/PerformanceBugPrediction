[`testTwoFields()`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/modules/aggs-matrix-stats/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/matrix/stats/MatrixStatsAggregatorTests.java#L60) fails if it is changed to `searchAndReduce()` instead of `search()`.  The variance of the test's `MultiPassStats` object no longer matches the reduced matrix stats response.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear if this is because the mock `MultiPassStats` is doing something wrong, or if there's a bug when the matrix agg's reduction is buggy.  MatrixStats uses a per-shard object (`RunningStats`) which is eventually converted into the final response object (`MatrixStatsObject`), at which point the correlation is calculated.  It might be part of this process that is buggy, or perhaps how the stats objects are finalized after reduction.","closed_by":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
