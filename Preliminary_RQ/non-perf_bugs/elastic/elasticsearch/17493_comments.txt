Do you terminate the Elasticsearch process with a signal, or do you simply pull the plug on the machine?\r\n\r\nI ask this because if you simply pull the plug then the established connections to the master are not actively dropped, so it looks like a networking blip, and Elasticsearch waits for the network to be restored for a while before starting a new election. If you terminate Elasticsearch first then the connections are actively dropped and a master should be elected more quickly.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/365984339","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17493#issuecomment-365984339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17493","id":365984339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTk4NDMzOQ==","user":{"login":"devoncrouse","id":1114734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ3MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1114734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devoncrouse","html_url":"https://github.com/devoncrouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devoncrouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devoncrouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devoncrouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devoncrouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devoncrouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devoncrouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devoncrouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devoncrouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devoncrouse/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-15T16:36:07Z","updated_at":"2018-02-15T16:36:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Aha, that's probably my issue; I assumed it would have been getting signaled on machine shutdown, but I see now what's happening.
