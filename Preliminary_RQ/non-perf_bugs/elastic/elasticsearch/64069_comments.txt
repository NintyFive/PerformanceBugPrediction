You should be able to look up relevant mapping information directly using `QueryShardContext`. For example it's common to use `QueryShardContext#getFieldType` to get a `MappedFieldType`. These `MappedFieldType` objects are designed to contain all the information needed for searching a field.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/714670733","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/64069#issuecomment-714670733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/64069","id":714670733,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDY3MDczMw==","user":{"login":"alexklibisz","id":8015228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTUyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/8015228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexklibisz","html_url":"https://github.com/alexklibisz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexklibisz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexklibisz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexklibisz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexklibisz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexklibisz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexklibisz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexklibisz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexklibisz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexklibisz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-22T18:14:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-22T18:14:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @jtibshirani , thanks for the quick response. I agree making a client call in that place was a bit hacky. I was actually only calling once and then caching the response for each index/field. Still hacky, so I'm open to revising it with a better approach. I mainly just need a way to access the original JSON used to construct the mapping (i.e. the same thing that's returned from `GET _mapping` API requests.
