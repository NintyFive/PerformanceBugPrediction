It currently reads like that:\n\n_\"A filter that matches documents using [and/or] boolean operator on other [TARGETS]\"_\n\nwhere [TARGETS] is either 'filters' or 'queries'\n\nDespite the already difficult to parse/understand construction, this leaves me puzzled, which of the two versions for [TARGETS] is intended? I tend to say, both should read _\"... on other filters\"_, but I don't know. \n\nAlso I wish, that sentence would be easier to understand. Maybe add an article, as in _\"using_ **the** _[and/or] boolean operator\"_?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
