This doesn't seem right as they are both mapped to the same analyzed type - Long.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\nRaw Kibana Query, same for each field except for field queried:\n\n```\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"query\": {\n        \"query_string\": {\n          \"query\": \"someQuery\",\n          \"analyze_wildcard\": true\n        }\n      },\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"bool\": {\n          \"must\": [\n            {\n              \"range\": {\n                \"@timestamp\": {\n                  \"gte\": 1472753632067,\n                  \"lte\": 1472753932067,\n                  \"format\": \"epoch_millis\"\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          ],\n          \"must_not\": []\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"highlight\": {\n    \"pre_tags\": [\n      \"@kibana-highlighted-field@\"\n    ],\n    \"post_tags\": [\n      \"@/kibana-highlighted-field@\"\n    ],\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"*\": {}\n    },\n    \"require_field_match\": false,\n    \"fragment_size\": 2147483647\n  },\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"2\": {\n      \"date_histogram\": {\n        \"field\": \"@timestamp\",\n        \"interval\": \"1m\",\n        \"time_zone\": \"America/Somewhere\",\n        \"min_doc_count\": 1,\n        \"extended_bounds\": {\n          \"min\": 1472753632066,\n          \"max\": 1472753932066\n        }\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"1\": {\n          \"avg\": {\n            \"field\": \"field1\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nField 1 Results:\n\n```\n{\n  \"took\": 3,\n  \"timed_out\": false,\n  \"_shards\": {\n    \"total\": 9,\n    \"successful\": 9,\n    \"failed\": 0\n  },\n  \"hits\": {\n    \"total\": 8337,\n    \"max_score\": 0,\n    \"hits\": []\n  },\n  \"aggregations\": {\n    \"2\": {\n      \"buckets\": [\n        {\n          \"1\": {\n            \"value\": 0.03139013452914798\n          },\n          \"key_as_string\": \"2016-09-01T13:13:00.000-05:00\",\n          \"key\": 1472753580000,\n          \"doc_count\": 223\n        },\n\n        ...etc\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nField2 Results:\n\n```\n{\n  \"took\": 12,\n  \"timed_out\": false,\n  \"_shards\": {\n    \"total\": 9,\n    \"successful\": 9,\n    \"failed\": 0\n  },\n  \"hits\": {\n    \"total\": 8318,\n    \"max_score\": 0,\n    \"hits\": []\n  },\n  \"aggregations\": {\n    \"2\": {\n      \"buckets\": [\n        {\n          \"1\": {\n            \"value\": 0\n          },\n          \"key_as_string\": \"2016-09-01T13:22:00.000-05:00\",\n          \"key\": 1472754120000,\n          \"doc_count\": 1559\n        },\n        ...etc\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo the second result is an average of zero, despite Field2 for that query containing 0, 0.1, 0.4, etc.\n\nAny help sincerely appreciated.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
