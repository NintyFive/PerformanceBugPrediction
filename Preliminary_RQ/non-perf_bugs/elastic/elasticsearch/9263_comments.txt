The underlying problem is that the `nested` aggregator relies on the fact that a parent docid / bucket ord combination is only processed once, but that isn't the case. Depending on where the `nested` aggregator is placed the same parent docid is processed multiple times and this results in incorrect results. (for example a terms agg emits multiple buckets for the same docid and a nested agg is a child agg of this terms agg)\n\nA similar problem also exists in the `reverse_nested` agg, which causes the second search request in this issue to yield incorrect results.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
