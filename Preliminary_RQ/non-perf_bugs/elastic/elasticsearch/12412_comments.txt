I just wonder if it would be possible to maybe crank up the logging for a short period after mutative changes have happened? Things like cluster nodes leaving / joining, or cluster allocation being completely disabled for a brief period. I'm sure such a request is terrifying and subject to a dizzying number of race conditions and nightmares attributed to distributed consensus, but I figure I'd ask anyway :P`\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/249902923","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12412#issuecomment-249902923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12412","id":249902923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTkwMjkyMw==","user":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T15:36:10Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T15:36:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is resolved with the cluster allocation explain API added in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/17305 (available in 5.0+)\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
