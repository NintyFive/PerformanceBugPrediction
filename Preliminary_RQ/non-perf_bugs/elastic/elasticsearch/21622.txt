It doesn't seem to happen if one of them has a value of -2147483648 or close to it (tried with 46 and 47) **AND** another has a positive value (tried here with 2). It works if the negative number is less extreme (-2000000000 for example) **OR** if the second template has a higher, yet still negative `order` (-2 for example).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n```\r\n# curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/_template/*\r\n# curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/_all\r\n\r\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/higher_order -d '{\r\n    \"template\": \"*\",\r\n    \"order\": 2,\r\n    \"mappings\": {\r\n      \"message\": {\r\n        \"properties\": {\r\n          \"foo\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"keyword\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}'\r\n\r\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/lower_order -d '{\r\n    \"order\" : -2147483648,\r\n    \"template\" : \"*\",\r\n    \"mappings\" : {\r\n      \"message\" : {\r\n        \"properties\" : {\r\n          \"foo\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"text\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }'\r\n\r\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test\r\ncurl localhost:9200/test?pretty\r\n#          \"foo\" : {\r\n#            \"type\" : \"text\"   # <----- should be keyword\r\n#          }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis affects Graylog users, see http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.1/pages/configuration/elasticsearch.html#custom-index-mappings","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
