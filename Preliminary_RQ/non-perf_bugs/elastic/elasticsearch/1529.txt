For example:\n\n```\n{\n\"sort\" : [\n    { \"user\" : {\"missing\" : \"_last\"} },\n],\n\"query\" : {\n    \"term\" : { \"user\" : \"kimchy\" }\n}\n\n{\n\"sort\" : [\n    { \"user\" : {\"missing\" : \"_last\"} },\n],\n\"query\" : {\n    \"term\" : { \"user\" : \"kimchy\" }\n}\n```\n\nUnfortunately we can't use this pattern for custom values. To support that, we'll need a sub-object:\n\n```\n{\n\"sort\" : [\n    { \"user\" : {\"missing\" : { \"order\": \"_first\"} } },\n],\n\"query\" : {\n    \"term\" : { \"user\" : \"kimchy\" }\n}\n\n{\n\"sort\" : [\n    { \"user\" : {\"missing\" : { \"order\": \"_last\"} } },\n],\n\"query\" : {\n    \"term\" : { \"user\" : \"kimchy\" }\n}\n\n{\n\"sort\" : [\n    { \"user\" : {\"missing\" : { \"value\": \"nobody\"} } },\n],\n\"query\" : {\n    \"term\" : { \"user\" : \"kimchy\" }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
