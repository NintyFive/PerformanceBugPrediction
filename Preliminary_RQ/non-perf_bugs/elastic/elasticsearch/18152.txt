requirement is to add a filter in to the query by using ejs but i couldn't get success on that.\nI have created a Json query for the same that is working for me but i need to convert that Json in form of ejs aggregation.\nBelow is my JSON query:-\n\n{\n    \"aggs\": {\n        \"parentsku\": {\n            \"terms\": {\n                \"field\": \"parentSku\",\n                \"order\": {\n                    \"_term\": \"asc\"\n                },\n                \"size\": 2\n            },\n            \"aggs\": {\n                \"cost\": {\n                    \"stats\": {\n                        \"field\": \"directCost\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"sales\": {\n                    \"stats\": {\n                        \"field\": \"revenu\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"quantity\": {\n                    \"stats\": {\n                        \"field\": \"quantity\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n```\n    }\n},\n \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n        \"filter\": {\n            \"range\": {\n                \"quantity\": {\n                    \"gte\": \"500\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n}\n\nThis query works for me when i check it with Postman client of google crome but i couldn't convert this is the form ejs aggregation and I have to use all the queries in form of ejs aggregation only.\nBelow is my ejs aggregation query:-\n\nvar myquery= ejs.Request()\n                                 .agg(ejs.TermsAggregation('parentsku').field(skufield.value                    || 'parentSku').order(\"_term\", \"asc\").size(50)\n                                  .agg(ejs.StatsAggregation('cost').field('directCost'))\n                    .agg(ejs.StatsAggregation('sales').field('revenu'))\n                                  .agg(ejs.StatsAggregation('quantity').field('quantity'))\n                                );\n\nI only need to add below part of query with above aggregation query and it will work for me.\n\n \"query\": {\n        \"filtered\": {\n            \"filter\": {\n                \"range\": {\n                    \"quantity\": {\n                        \"gte\": \"500\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nIn short i want to convert above Json query in form of aggregration.I tried many alternates for that below is one from them \n\nvar query= ejs.Request().query(ejs.FilterAggregation('filtered').filter(ejs.RangeFilter('quantity').gt(200)))\nbut it is not working exception is like \"Argument must be query\" it means \"ejs.FilterAggregation('filtered').filter(ejs.RangeFilter('quantity').gt(200))\" is not a query.
