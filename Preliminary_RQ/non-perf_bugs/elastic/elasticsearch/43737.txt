My expectation is that this should be prevented, because it leads to difficulty deleting the template individually.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Run: `DELETE _template/test-*`\r\n2. Run `GET _template/test-*`\r\n3. Observe there is no template named \"test-*\"\r\n4. Run:\r\n```\r\nPUT _template/test-*\r\n{ \r\n  \"order\" : 10, \r\n  \"index_patterns\" : [\"test-*\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n5. Run:\r\n```\r\nPUT _template/test-inner-*\r\n{ \r\n  \"order\" : 10, \r\n  \"index_patterns\" : [\"test-inner-*\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n6. Run `GET _template/test-*`\r\n7. Observe that there is a template named \"test-*\" and \"test-inner-*\"\r\n8. Run `DELETE _template/test-*`\r\n9. Run `GET _template/test-*`\r\n10. Observe that both \"test-*\" and \"test-inner-*\" are no longer present\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is verified on 6.6.2 and 6.7.0 and 7.6.1","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
