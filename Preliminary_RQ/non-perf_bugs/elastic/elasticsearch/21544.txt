This approach has fallen out of favor with the Elasticsearch project and we don't write new code using it internally. Instead we tend to use http to test against a cluster started by gradle using Elasticsearch's standard startup scripts. This gives us a \"more real\" test.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with this disconnect is that we no longer publish the jars that you'd need to run a fully stood up cluster to maven central. The jars are available in central but inside the zip distribution. The `ESIntegTestCase` way of testing looks promising and convenient so users start down that path only to be thwarted by unavailable jars.\r\n\r\nWe need to fix this documentation so it expresses our current recommendations.
