I think the source of the confusing is that it also _only_ holds for the initial cluster forming after a full cluster restart or an outage. In those cases the master waits until it sees enough nodes to start assigning shards.\n\nFor a single node restart, I believe you expect something like delaying the re-assignment of a shard for a couple of minutes with the hope the node will come back. I think there is an issue for it somewhere but can't find it now. If you confirm I'll dig it up and/or open another issue.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/88437429","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10340#issuecomment-88437429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10340","id":88437429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4NDM3NDI5","user":{"login":"mbarrin","id":1845655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDU2NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1845655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarrin","html_url":"https://github.com/mbarrin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarrin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarrin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarrin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarrin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarrin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarrin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarrin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarrin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbarrin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-01T10:49:17Z","updated_at":"2015-04-01T10:49:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah thanks for the clarification.
