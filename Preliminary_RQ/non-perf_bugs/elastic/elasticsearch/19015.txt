When creating new roles if you type something into the query field and then delete it and save the role. The role get created with an empty query field rather than no query field. This can cause problems when the role is assigned. I also noticed the \"field\" field has similar problems even if you don't select it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukasolson","id":1178348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1178348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasolson","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasolson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
