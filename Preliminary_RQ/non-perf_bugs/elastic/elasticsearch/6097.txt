Those options are listed here in our docs: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-index.html .\n\nAll apis support the `expand_wildcards` option that accepts `open`, `closed` or both as values, while create and restore snapshot apis accept `expand_wildcards_open` and `expand_wildcards_closed` as booleans instead.
