However, links seem to break sometimes.\n\nE.g. I expected a link like [`https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.x/docs-bulk.html`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.x/docs-bulk.html) to always show the documentation for bulk operations in ES 2.x. However, the link above 404's but this one does work [`https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/docs-bulk.html`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/docs-bulk.html). However, it's a PITA to change links based on the current version of ES 2.x.\n\nOf course I expect links to break between major versions (as features change etc.), but not between minor versions.\n\nWhat's the right strategy here?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
