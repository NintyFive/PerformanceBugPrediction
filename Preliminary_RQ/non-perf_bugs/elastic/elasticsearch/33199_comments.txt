It seems we fail with and exception [here ](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/blobstore/BlobStoreRepository.java#L670) but the issue is that the file is there but is empty ie. has length of `0`. Now further [down](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/blobstore/BlobStoreRepository.java#L701) we have some special logic that if the file is not there we exit normally. Is it possible that we have a race condition where the file is there but not written fully?  Like with FSRepository this seems to be an issue [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/2bb4f3837113952488a9c71773107b024b756d14/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/blobstore/fs/FsBlobContainer.java#L132-L134)?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/417352989","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33199#issuecomment-417352989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33199","id":417352989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzM1Mjk4OQ==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-30T15:05:21Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T15:05:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I assigned it to you to make sure it's been taken care of.

The temp-file-and-rename dance feels more like an implementation detail of `FsBlobContainer` than something that needs to be available to all the repos, and I can't actually see any cases where we want the write to happen non-atomically.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/419811404","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33199#issuecomment-419811404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33199","id":419811404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTgxMTQwNA==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-10T07:12:46Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T07:12:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pinging @tlrx about this too.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/456513537","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33199#issuecomment-456513537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/33199","id":456513537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjUxMzUzNw==","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-22T18:39:23Z","updated_at":"2019-01-22T18:39:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Duplicates #37005","performed_via_github_app":null}]
