This, though, has the downside mentioned in https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/35489.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to load the `_source` and extract the needed fields from there.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, the difficulty here is especially relevant for [date and numeric fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/search-request-docvalue-fields.html#_custom_formats) where ES SQL needs to do the same parsing ES is doing when indexing a document so that the user is presented with the same value it would get back from Elasticsearch itself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if one field only is already taken from `_source`, we should take all of them from `_source` since the `_source` is already loaded and built as JSON and the computational effort to re-parse the numeric and date fields is worth it.\r\n\r\nOr, as a second alternative, maybe get fields other than dates from `_source` and the dates from `docvalues_fields` and skip re-parsing the dates.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"astefan","id":893749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/893749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan","html_url":"https://github.com/astefan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
