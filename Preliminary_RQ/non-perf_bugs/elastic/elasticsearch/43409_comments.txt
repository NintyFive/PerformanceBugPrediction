That is rollover provides primitives, and then on top of this you have to coordinate calls to the rollover API via cron or some other automation. Additionally, we offer index lifecycle management functionality which enables you to set a policy, and then index lifecycle management would periodically execute the rollover API (with your desired condition on your behalf).\r\n\r\nSee the following note in the [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/indices-rollover-index.html) for further details:\r\n\r\n>To roll over an index, a condition must be met when you call the API. Elasticsearch does not monitor the index after you receive an API response. To automatically roll over indices when a condition is met, you can use Elasticsearchâ€™s [index lifecycle management (ILM) policies](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/index-lifecycle-management.html).\r\n\r\nDoes that help?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/503972566","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43409#issuecomment-503972566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43409","id":503972566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzk3MjU2Ng==","user":{"login":"kleinlain","id":15013266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEzMjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15013266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleinlain","html_url":"https://github.com/kleinlain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleinlain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleinlain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleinlain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleinlain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleinlain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleinlain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleinlain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleinlain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kleinlain/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-20T10:28:47Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T10:28:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"uh, yes this helps a lot, unfortunately this block you quoted, is not part of the 5.6 (which we are still using) version of the documentation.\r\n\r\nIs there a recommendation how to handle this with 5.6? besides the obvious upgrade? ;)\r\n\r\nthanks a lot, at least it clarifies the whole issue","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/503975124","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43409#issuecomment-503975124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/43409","id":503975124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzk3NTEyNA==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-20T10:37:28Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T10:37:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Is there a recommendation how to handle this with 5.6? besides the obvious upgrade? ;)\r\n\r\nYes, sorry, index lifecycle management is not available in GA form until 6.7.
