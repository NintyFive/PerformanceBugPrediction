If we issue a PUT command with the above definition (but setting enabled: true in the metadata), it throws the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"root_cause\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"security_exception\",\r\n        \"reason\": \"current license is non-compliant for [field and document level security]\",\r\n        \"license.expired.feature\": \"field and document level security\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"type\": \"security_exception\",\r\n    \"reason\": \"current license is non-compliant for [field and document level security]\",\r\n    \"license.expired.feature\": \"field and document level security\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"status\": 403\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRecreating the role without this section works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"field_security\": {\r\n          \"grant\": []\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt can be a better experience if we do not disable the role (if FLS/DLS is no longer licensed) and allow the role to continue to function without FLS/DLS (we already have the confirmation/warning dialog on license downgrade for the admin to acknowledge that FLS/DLS will stop working).","closed_by":{"login":"tvernum","id":2244393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2244393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum","html_url":"https://github.com/tvernum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvernum/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
