I currently have a fully reactive workflow in a Spring Boot project, except for the Elasticsearch REST client, which I have to block on until the entire SearchResponse object has been returned.  It would be very interesting to see a reactive REST client that streams results.  \r\n\r\nI noticed that under the hood, the ES REST client is using Apache NIO for async requests.  Apache NIO also supports reactive HTTP sessions:\r\n\r\nhttps://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-core-ga/tutorial/html/nio.html","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
