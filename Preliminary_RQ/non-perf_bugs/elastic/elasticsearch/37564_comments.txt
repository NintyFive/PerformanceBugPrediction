So even if you did get this to work, it likely isn't an ideal scenario. \r\n\r\nThere are plans to de-couple the High Level Rest Client from the Elasticsearch server code base, however, today that dependency is required. Once we get to that point, we will need to evaluate the level of support/testing we do for andriod (today it is none). \r\n\r\n> So what do you suggest?\r\n\r\nOur REST API's are pretty well documented, and would suggest to use an HTTP library for andriod and call the REST endpoints directly. \r\n\r\nI am going to close this issue, but perhaps someone on discuss forums (https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) has faced a similar challenge and can provide better alternatives.
