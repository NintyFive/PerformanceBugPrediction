#49634 proposed using `search_after` parameter as a way to pass information between requests to continue retrieving results.\r\nHowever when it comes to sequences and joins, this seems inadequate to handle the information needed to _resume_ a query plus it requires the initial query to be sent again (which is unfortunate).\r\n\r\nAn alternative that is worth exploring is using a scroll/cursor like approach in which the resuming information is sent back to the client so a subsequent requests only sends that information back, without any other parameters.\r\n\r\nThis issue is raised to acknowledge the identified gap in the initial proposal and gather further discussions once development touches this topic.","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
