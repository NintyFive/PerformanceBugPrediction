This means the package is unusable until this is manually resolved (which causes issues with automated config systems such as Puppet).\n\nThe easiest way to get a JRE installed on Debian is to add `default-jre-headless | java6-runtime-headless` to the \"Depends\" line in the package control file. This tells APT to install Debian's default JRE  if no JRE is currently installed, and the second part tells APT that the dependency can be satisfied by any JRE package that provides at least a version 6-level Java (both the 7.x and 8.x JRE packages provide this).\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
