This means that the order of classes might not be the same between runs even if the same seed is passed in. We would rather not have randomization and have reproducible order instead. \r\n     -  ephemeral workers in CI miss out on the historical timing data entirely \r\n     - the performance benefit of the balancing is not significant enough to continue investing in this feature. \r\n     - the class of problems the test class order randomization was meant to solve ( static fields and initialization )  was largely eliminated and we are not overly concerned about it keeping back.
