Our default startup logic waits for up to 30 second for the node to join before opening up the http API. It seems something is preventing your nodes from discovering the cluster. I'm going to close this issue as it seems things are working as designed. If you have any questions/need help debugging, please open a thread on discuss.elastic.co . If we end up finding a bug, we can reopen this issue.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
