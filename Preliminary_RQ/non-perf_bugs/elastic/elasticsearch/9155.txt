If you want to sort them last, you need to emit a string that compares greater than any other string. Unfortunately, there is no such string, so we have a hack that returns a string with a single code point `0X10FFFF` that we hope will compare greater to all strings that are in the index. And this becomes even worse when with paging: in order for the comparator to work well, we need to feed it with `null` as a top value, not `0X10FFFF`, and tell it to sort missing values last.\n\nInstead of trying to serialize a maximum string, we should instead return null AND a boolean that tells whether to sort missing values first or last. The good news is that this is something TopDocs.merge is aware of so this should not require any modification of the reduce code.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
