Groovy does this but in many cases its suggestions are not very relevant. We are search guys, we should be good at this :)\n- perhaps we could have some basic syntax \"guiding\" from front-end tools. It could start with seeing if we can e.g. add basic syntax highlighting which helps, and perhaps some better integration with syntax errors, IDE-like autocomplete, and so on later.\n- exception messages can be improved. painless is not perfect here, but the number one thing I see as a problem here is ES itself squashing the structured exceptions, this has got to get better...\n- and so on\n\nBasically I'm saying i dont think writing 200 pages of docs/examples is the silver bullet to ease-of-use. What we have is minimal, i agree, and probably has a lot of bugs and could be improved too, no doubt about that, and can be improved, but we should look at the big picture.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/239501536","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19960#issuecomment-239501536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19960","id":239501536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTUwMTUzNg==","user":{"login":"jdconrad","id":2126764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2126764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad","html_url":"https://github.com/jdconrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdconrad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-12T17:00:11Z","updated_at":"2016-08-12T17:00:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@clintongormley I'm in complete agreement that our documentation can be improved here (true for most things :) ).
