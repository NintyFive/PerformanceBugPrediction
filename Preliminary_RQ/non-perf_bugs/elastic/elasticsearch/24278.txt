the feature**:\r\nnowadays when eable request cache, each node hold the request results by its own. \r\nso can we make it more memory efficiency by below ways:\r\n1. if enable request cache, can we route request to node by request hash so that same request will route to same node, therefore, they can use/hit the same cache\r\n2. we don't route request but at the time we fetch/put cache, we make a distributed cache based on curreny
