@imotov,\r\nLooks like this can be reproduced locally too, quite easily, and on the latest release, 7.4, as well:\r\n\r\n- get & run the latest release, using defaults (1G heap) \r\n  - can also run a 2/3-node local cluster instead, with same results\r\n- create an index with 80 shards (it can stay empty)\r\n- POST a term query like the above/attached. To create a sizable 4MB request, I had to go up to 40K clauses\r\n\r\nThe same OOM is produced. Note, if you turn off all logging, the OOM is ~immediate.\r\nThe heap dump looks much the same: the 4MB request I submitted is serialized to a ~6MB string internally (once `\"boost\":1.0` etc. are added to each clause) and two error strings containing it are part of each shard failure as `cause.detailMessage` and `reason`.\r\n\r\nSo 12 * 80 = 960MB. In fact, the OOM is produced when the total from these strings is at about 750MB, given the system's own baseline heap usage.\r\n\r\n![VisualVM 1 4 4 2019-11-18 14 22 41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6945923/69082913-16b57780-0a0f-11ea-8ced-b742cf0b0089.png)\r\n\r\n[elasticsearch.log](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/4119161/elasticsearch.log)\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
