I agree with it, just curious on your thoughts?\r\n\r\nBesides the standard time progression use case of data into a searchable snapshot with ILM, there is a less popular use case of getting data into a searchable snapshot as quickly as possible, this could be part of a migration effort, or writing directly to an \"archive\". I don't think this use case needs ILM, I just want to note it as a potential use case here. Even with this use case and converting to a snapshot in the warm phase, the user could configure a very brief hot phase and still use ILM.
