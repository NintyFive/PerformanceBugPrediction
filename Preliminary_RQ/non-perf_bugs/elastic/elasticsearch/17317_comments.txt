Maybe it lets us cut the lucene-memory dependency from core? That isn't a big deal either, I don't think.\n\nBeyond the testing speed improvement (which is mighty!) the most compelling argument for moving it out of core is that we can point to core and say \"this is very extensible. we've moved core features into modules to demonstrate that you can too!\"\n\nSo, yeah, I don't see a reason to work really hard on this but if it isn't particularly hard I think it is worth it.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/200819801","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17317#issuecomment-200819801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17317","id":200819801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDgxOTgwMQ==","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T12:53:59Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T12:53:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@javanna I think the general goal is to make core slimmer?
