There's no direct bug here, just an unexpected retry on a node closed exception where we wouldn't expect one (while in the other issue we see a retry that we would expect on that very same exception not happening ...).\r\nI'll try to track down what changed here over the last few days~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: the above wasn't true (it just looked like it was ...) The problem is the optimization made in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/62173 is to blame for changing test behavior here (not a bug though). I'll open a fix PR shortly","performed_via_github_app":null}]
