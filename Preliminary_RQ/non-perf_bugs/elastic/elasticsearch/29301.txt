However, the search with the same parameters works when the geo distance query is excluded.\r\n- The search is successful if I manually copy the master bool query string and paste it into my ElasticSearch Head browser plugin (and also curl I'm assuming).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nBoolQueryBuilder queryBuilder = QueryBuilders.boolQuery();\r\nqueryBuilder.should(\r\n    QueryBuilders.geoDistanceQuery(term).point(origin).distance(distance)\r\n);\r\n\r\nclient.prepareSearch(index)\r\n        .setTypes(type)\r\n        .setFrom(from)\r\n        .setSize(size)\r\n        .setQuery(queryBuilder);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Stack trace**:\r\n[java.io.IOException Unknown GeoDistance ordinal [2].txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/1861428/java.io.IOException.Unknown.GeoDistance.ordinal.2.txt)","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
