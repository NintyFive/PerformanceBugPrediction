can actually run the ES image with a different UID, but if you change the GID then you'll run into the problem described here.\r\n\r\nI think the root cause of the issue is probably the upgrade in 7.7.0 from OpenJDK 13 to 14. We don't fiddle with the JDK permissions in the Dockerfile, the image just inherits the perms from the ES distribution.\r\n\r\nI can tweak the Dockerfile to make sure that the `./jdk` directory has acceptable permissions, but we might want to think about how far we want to support running ES with a different UID / GID. For example, when running:\r\n\r\n    docker run -it --rm -u 1001:1001 -e 'discovery.type=single-node' elasticsearch:test \r\n\r\nIf I fix the group perms of the directories under `./jdk`, ES still won't start because it can't read `./config/elasticseach.yml`. If I allow that, then it fails because it can't write to `./logs/gc.log`. You can see where this is going. An obvious workaround is to bind-mount your own `config` and `logs` directories.\r\n\r\n@blightbow given the above, can you share a few more details about how you're running Elasticsearch? Would just fixing the `./jdk` permissions be sufficient?\r\n\r\nI hesitate to mention this, but another option would be to allow the UID and GID to be reconfigured at runtime, [per this example](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/creating_images/guidelines.html#use-uid) (note that the latest version of that document has removed that example). The downside is that we'd have to default to running the container as `root` again, which we wanted to get away from.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/674265576","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60864#issuecomment-674265576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60864","id":674265576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDI2NTU3Ng==","user":{"login":"blightbow","id":1294297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1294297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow","html_url":"https://github.com/blightbow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-14T20:46:12Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T20:46:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> You can actually run the ES image with a different UID, but if you change the GID then you'll run into the problem described here.\r\n\r\nWhoops!

Would just fixing the `./jdk` permissions be sufficient?\r\n\r\nWe were already mounting `config` and `logs` in our environment, so I agree that correcting the permissions on `./jdk` would be the way to go. There shouldn't be need for anything fancier than this unless there are other files the JDK needs to read from that have changed in the interim. (unlikely if the JDK upgrade resulted in the permission changes)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/674276643","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60864#issuecomment-674276643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/60864","id":674276643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDI3NjY0Mw==","user":{"login":"blightbow","id":1294297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1294297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow","html_url":"https://github.com/blightbow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blightbow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-14T21:19:24Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T21:19:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Here is a full list of our mounts.
