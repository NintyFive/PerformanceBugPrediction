Nodes info gives only the transport address:\n\n```\n      \"name\" : \"tribe1/t1\",\n      \"transport_address\" : \"127.0.0.1:9303\",\n      \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\",\n      \"ip\" : \"127.0.0.1\",\n      \"version\" : \"5.0.0-alpha1\",\n      \"build_hash\" : \"7d4ed5b\",\n      \"roles\" : [ ]\n```\n\nby comparison, a \"normal\" node has the HTTP address as well:\n\n```\n      \"name\" : \"logs1\",\n      \"transport_address\" : \"127.0.0.1:9301\",\n      \"host\" : \"127.0.0.1\",\n      \"ip\" : \"127.0.0.1\",\n      \"version\" : \"5.0.0-alpha1\",\n      \"build_hash\" : \"7d4ed5b\",\n      \"http_address\" : \"127.0.0.1:9201\"\n...\n```\n\nAlso, in 5.0.0alpha1, the _cat nodes API doesn't return the HTTP address, even when requested specifically:\n\n```\n$ curl localhost:9200/_cat/nodes?h=name,http_address\nusers1    127.0.0.1:9200\ntribe1/t2 -\n```\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Start one node in one cluster, with a config like:\n\n```\nnode.name: logs1\ncluster.name: logs\n```\n1. Then a second node in one cluster:\n\n```\nnode.name: users1\ncluster.name: users\n```\n1. Finally a tribe node:\n\n```\nnode.name: tribe1\ntribe.t1.cluster.name: logs\ntribe.t2.cluster.name: users\n# http.port: 9250  # behavior seems the same whether port is explicitly specified or not\n```\n1. Call the Cat Nodes and Nodes Info APIs, looking for the HTTP address\n","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
