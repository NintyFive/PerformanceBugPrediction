Both the current issue and https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45035 and https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48234 have, from SQL point of view, the same cause: same timezone has different offsets in two different Java versions. In a newer Java version (let's say 12), a certain timezone has its offset changed from +1 to +2, for example, compared to Java 8.\r\n\r\nAnd what happens in these tests' failures is that the test itself runs on a Java version while the ES node on which the query is executed against, runs on another Java version.\r\n\r\nThe aspect I am not sure about is: should the test and ES node have the same Java runtime version? If so (and this was my impression so far), then there is something wrong with our tests infra.\r\nIf not, then the workaround in the PR @costin mentioned should fix these failures.\r\n\r\nThe command to be used when a certain failure is to be reproduced locally specifies the `runtime.java` version and I assumed this is the same on all the JVMs started in tests. For this particular test it seems there is no `runtime` specified in the command..., but from logs it's openjdk11 and JAVA_HOME is openjdk13.
