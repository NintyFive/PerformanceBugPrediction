I can confirm this is a bug, and happens on a non-cloud install as well.  We did some digging and the problem, while it coincides with the new BKD-based geoshapes, it's actually a tangential bug.\r\n\r\nPre-6.6, the default `geo_shape` tree was a `geohash`.  For a [long time](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25833) we have wanted to change that to `quadtree`, because it's just a better default for most people.  When we merged the BKD geoshape work, we also [switched the default](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/25833#issuecomment-445911525) of the legacy prefix tree over to `quadtree`.\r\n\r\nThe bug is that we're not checking the index version when constructing a default legacy prefix tree, so the pre-6.6 `geohash` tree is being interpreted as a `quadtree`... which means no terms are matching and you get empty hits.\r\n\r\nThe fix should be pretty simple (load the correct default tree type depending on version) and I don't it will require any reindexing.  We should also find out why no exceptions were thrown when interpreting the `geohash` as `quadtree` and add some if they don't exist.\r\n\r\nSorry for the hassle!
