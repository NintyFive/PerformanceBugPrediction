Unfortunately, the side effect of this is `-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError` is now utterly broken.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Install my [production-ready, webscale OOM plugin](https://github.com/samcday/elasticsearch-oomonster)\n2. Run `JAVA_OPTS=\"-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=pwd\" bin/elasticsearch`\n3. `curl localhost:9200/_cat/oom`\n\nWith the above steps, you'll see some output like this:\n\n```\n#\n# java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n# -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=\"pwd\"\n#   Executing \"pwd\"...\n```\n\nBut the command doesn't actually run. On Linux, that's the end of it. If you run it in OSX, you'll actually get a more insightful message immediately after the above output:\n\n```\nos::fork_and_exec failed: Resource temporarily unavailable (35)\n```\n\nIf you then follow the same steps above, but instead run `JAVA_OPTS=-Des.bootstrap.seccomp=false bin/elasticsearch`, you'll see that the OOM handler works properly.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
