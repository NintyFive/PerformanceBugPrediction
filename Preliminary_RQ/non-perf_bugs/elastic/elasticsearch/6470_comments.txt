I have a multi-tenant ElasticSearch cluster, where tenant1 data is in \"index1\" and tenant2 data is in \"index2\". There are two instances of client applications for tenant1 and tenant2 respectively. \r\n\r\nIt is strictly forbidden to mix search results for these tenants, i.e. if people of tenant1 see some data that doesn't belong them and find out it is some other tenant data they will go crazy about that.\r\n\r\nSo right now all search queries are written so they specify the exact index the need to search against. But it happened a couple of times that someone forgot to specify index and some queries would return mixed data. Luckily this was caught early enough. \r\n\r\nSo I'm thinking having some switch that just prevents searching against all indices makes a lot of sense due to the above scenario. \r\n\r\nP.S. If there is another way of tenant bulletproof isolation within a cluster I would really like to know it.
