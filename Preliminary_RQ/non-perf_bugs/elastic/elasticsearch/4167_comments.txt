If you want this I recommend to set the cutoff frequency as an absolute number ie. `10` and do the calculation yourself by running a count on the type. The reason why I don't want to do this is since we don't have this statistic at hand but we might be able to do that somehow in the future. what we can do and maybe should provide as an option is to calculate this not on the  number of docs in the index but on the `docCount` which is the number of docs that have a value in the field you run the query on. That way you can just have a type private field and get that for free.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/34851499","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4167#issuecomment-34851499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/4167","id":34851499,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODUxNDk5","user":{"login":"joshfg","id":5942539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDI1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5942539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfg","html_url":"https://github.com/joshfg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-12T09:22:14Z","updated_at":"2014-02-12T09:22:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"yes that sounds like a good idea - it would solve the problems we have had!
