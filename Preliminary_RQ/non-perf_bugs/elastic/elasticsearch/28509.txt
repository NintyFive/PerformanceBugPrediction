Now when I turn that node up and connect it to a master node and a client node, the cluster is formed but still all the shards of all indices remain unassigned. cluster health is `red` can this be an issue of the `segments.gen` file? if so, where can I find it? \r\n\r\nIt's strange since, `_cluster/allocation/explain` returns:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"index\": \"pu_reviews_prod_db\",\r\n        \"shard\": 2,\r\n        \"primary\": true,\r\n        \"current_state\": \"unassigned\",\r\n        \"unassigned_info\": {\r\n            \"reason\": \"CLUSTER_RECOVERED\",\r\n            \"at\": \"2018-02-03T21:37:38.066Z\",\r\n            \"last_allocation_status\": \"no_valid_shard_copy\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"can_allocate\": \"no_valid_shard_copy\",\r\n        \"allocate_explanation\": \"cannot allocate because all found copies of the shard are either stale or corrupt\",\r\n        \"node_allocation_decisions\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"node_id\": \"WtN6PQV_SI6CQPe2xOdk6Q\",\r\n                \"node_name\": \"ates-data-01\",\r\n                \"transport_address\": \"99.0.xx.yy:9300\",\r\n                \"node_decision\": \"no\",\r\n                \"store\": {\r\n                    \"in_sync\": false,\r\n                    \"allocation_id\": \"MglwwWL0QHeRCuMFZVCDKQ\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    } \r\n\r\nand the old data node is exactly the way it was and the master nodes and client nodes are both v5.6.2 as before.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
