Generic Settings\n\nA generic configuration of the AWS that includes the account and key can be set using:\n\n```\ncloud:\n  aws:\n    access_key: XXXX\n    secret_key: YYYY\n```\n## S3 Gateway\n\nThe S3 gateway is configured using:\n\n```\ngateway:\n type: s3\n s3:\n   bucket: bucket_name_goes_here\n```\n\nThe `s3` gateway allows for the following settings:\n- `bucket`: The bucket name, required.\n- `region`: The region, defaults to `us-standard`. Can be one of `us-west`, `EU`, and `ap-southeast-1`.\n## EC2 Discovery\n\nThe EC2 based discovery can be set using:\n\n```\ndiscovery:\n  type: ec2\n```\n\nThe `ec2` discovery allows for the following settings:\n- `host_type`: The host that will be used to connect to other instances. Can be `private_ip`, `public_ip`, `private_dns`, and `public_dns`. Defaults to `private_dns`.\n- `groups`: A set of security groups (either as array, or comma separated) to filter instances to connect to. Defaults to no filtering at all.\n- `availability_zones`: A set of availability zones (either as array, or comma separated) to filter instances to connect to.
