I get an \"illegal argument exception\" when I run this. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    \"lang\" : \"painless\",\r\n    \"source\" : \"\r\n        for ( car in ctx._source.cars ){\r\n            if ( car.items != null ){\r\n                for ( item in car.items ){\r\n                    item.name.keyword = item.name; // <-- Illegal argument exception\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only way I got this to work was setting `item.name = item.name`.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the ability to manually set subfields using an `updateByQuery` script has been removed in ES7.
