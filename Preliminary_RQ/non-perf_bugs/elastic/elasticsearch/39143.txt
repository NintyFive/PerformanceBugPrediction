The definitions for these watches can be found in this folder: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/x-pack/plugin/monitoring/src/main/resources/monitoring/watches.\r\n\r\nSome of these watches rely on `hits.total` being a scalar value. For example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/1aa10c4b27221bb38d2ee37f683557858ae7638e/x-pack/plugin/monitoring/src/main/resources/monitoring/watches/elasticsearch_cluster_status.json#L132\r\n\r\nStarting 7.0, Elasticsearch will default to `hits.total` being an object instead of a scalar value. To account for this, two sets of fixes ought to be made to the Cluster Alerts watches:\r\n\r\n1. In the `6.7` branch, these watches should include `rest_total_hits_as_int` in their `search` queries. This will allow a Cluster Alert watch created by a `6.7` cluster to function properly either on a `6.7` or `7.0` monitoring cluster.\r\n\r\n2. In the `7.0`, `7.x`, and `master` branches, these watches should be updated so any references to `hits.total` refer to `hits.total.value` instead.","closed_by":{"login":"jakelandis","id":976291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjI5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/976291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis","html_url":"https://github.com/jakelandis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakelandis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
