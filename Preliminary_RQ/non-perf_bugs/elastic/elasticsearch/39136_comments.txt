In Java-Time 4 characters means \"full format\", but 5 characters means \"narrow format\" (a single letter), so `MMMMM` used to mean \"full month name\", but now means \"first character of the month name\". **Solution**: Use `MMMM` (or `LLLL`)\r\n2. _Ugly_: Java-time doesn't seem to support true \"full format\" names on the `ROOT` locale. If we force `Locale.ENGLISH`, then `MMMM` will output as `February`, but in `Locale.ROOT` (our default behaviour) it will only output `Feb`, I cannot find a way to get it use full names for months or days of the week on the `ROOT` locale.\r\n\r\nDo either of you know of a good solution for point 2? The options seem to be:\r\n1. Accept that it will use abbreviated names. This is a minor behaviour change from 6.x, and not a big deal, but retaining the full names would make the warning message clearer.\r\n2. Force the formatter to use the `ENGLISH` locale.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/468642238","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39136#issuecomment-468642238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39136","id":468642238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODY0MjIzOA==","user":{"login":"pgomulka","id":11137008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTM3MDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11137008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka","html_url":"https://github.com/pgomulka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-01T11:58:27Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T11:58:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tvernum I think you are right - the jdk since 9 is using CLDR which is not specifying full format for ROOT locale. https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/252\r\nwe might be able force the jdk8 behaviour where the 'full form' has fully formated names (as per that openjdk ticket `-Djava.locale.providers=COMPAT`)\r\n\r\nI would rather prefer to break the behaviour in 7 and have a 'short form' names. \r\n\r\nBut still using MMMM - I am not sure if we should expect at some point CLDR returning 'full form' for root locale?\r\nsomeone raised the same problem: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8205675","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/472420407","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39136#issuecomment-472420407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/39136","id":472420407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjQyMDQwNw==","user":{"login":"pgomulka","id":11137008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTM3MDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/11137008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka","html_url":"https://github.com/pgomulka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgomulka/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-13T13:25:36Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T13:25:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tsullivan I have changed this, but I noticed that by default we do run elasticsearch with `COMPAT` for jdk9+. \r\ndid you run your elasticsearch with a custom `jvm.options`?\r\nby default we have `9-:-Djava.locale.providers=COMPAT` in this file.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
