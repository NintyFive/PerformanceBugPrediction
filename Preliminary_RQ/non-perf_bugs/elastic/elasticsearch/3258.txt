started working on adding a score_mode parameter to the rescore query, something like :\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"rescore\" : {\n      \"window_size\" : 50,\n      \"query\" : {\n         \"rescore_query\" : {\n            \"match\" : {\n               \"field1\" : {\n                  \"query\" : \"the quick brown\",\n                  \"type\" : \"phrase\",\n                  \"slop\" : 2\n               }\n            }\n         },\n         \"query_weight\" : 0.7,\n         \"rescore_query_weight\" : 1.2,\n         \"score_mode\" : \"multiply\"\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nDefault is \"total\", possible values are : avg, max, min, total and multiply.\n\nMy use case is for the \"multiply\", because I want to do something like:\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"query\" : {\n      // lot of complex queries\n      // default scoring\n   },\n   \"rescore\" : {\n      \"window_size\" : 500,\n      \"query\" : {\n         \"rescore_query\" : {\n            \"custom_score\" : {\n              \"query\" : { \"match_all\" : { } },\n              \"script\" : \"complex_scoring\",\n              \"lang\" : \"native\"\n            }\n          },\n         \"query_weight\" : 1.0,\n         \"rescore_query_weight\" : 1.2\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nSo rather than having to duplicate my complex query in the rescore query, I just multiply the first score with the second one.\n\nWhat do you think? I will post my code.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
