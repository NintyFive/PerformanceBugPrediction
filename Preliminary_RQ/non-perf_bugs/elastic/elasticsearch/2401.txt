bottom):\n\nhttp://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/root-object-type.html\n\nthe first mapping that matches will be applied -- i.e. \"everything\" should only be applied to fields that don't match \"strings\".\n\nHowever, this isn't what I see (in 0.19.8 anyway) -- no matter which order I put the mappings in, all fields have \"everything\" applied, including string fields.\n\n(By the way, \"lowercase\" is a simple custom analayzer with a keyword tokenizer and lowercase token filter.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
