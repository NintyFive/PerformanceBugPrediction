My guess is that its supposed to be testing that an exception is \r\nthrown if you provide invalid model parameters. From a conversation with @colings86 we think that\r\nthe padding parameter passed in ensure the alpha and beta values are invalid, but that seems to be\r\ntrappy because if the randomness selects simple or linear models the padding isnâ€™t used and the model \r\nwill be valid.
