way `HistogramAggregator` works is that for every value, it is going to\ncompute a rounded value, that basically looks like `(value / interval) * interval` (using integer arithmetic) and use it as a key in a hash table to aggregate counts.\n\nHowever, the exact rounded value is not needed yet at that stage, all we need\nis a value that uniquely identifies the bucket, such as `(value / interval)`.\nWe could only multiply with `interval` again when building the bucket: this way\nthe second step is only performed once per bucket instead of once per value.\n\nAlthough this looks like a micro optimization for the case that was just\ndecribed, it makes more sense with the date rounding implementations that we\nhave that are more CPU-intensive.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
