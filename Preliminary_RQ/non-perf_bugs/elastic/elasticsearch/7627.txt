I have some documents stored in http://localhost:9200/myindex/mytype\n\nand each document contains a field called `country` which is a 2-letters country code such as \"US\", \"CN\", \"DE\"\n\nThen I searched those document using query below\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XGET 127.0.0.1:9200/myindex/_search?pretty -d '\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"term\": { \"country\": \"US\" }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nand the returned result is always null even when there are lots of documents has field `\"country\": \"US\"`\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"took\" : 1,\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\n  \"_shards\" : {\n    \"total\" : 5,\n    \"successful\" : 5,\n    \"failed\" : 0\n  },\n  \"hits\" : {\n    \"total\" : 0,\n    \"max_score\" : null,\n    \"hits\" : [ ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut when I search again using lower case, to my big surprise, it worked!\n\n``` bash\ncurl -XGET 127.0.0.1:9200/myindex/_search?pretty -d '\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"term\": { \"country\": \"us\" }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\nAnd I've checked the returned object, all of them are correct.\n\nSo, I checked the elasticsearch documents for a while, but didn't find anything related. Is it a bug? Or a feature?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
