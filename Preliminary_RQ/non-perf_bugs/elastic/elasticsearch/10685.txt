Since ES currently supports 2D only, it seems natural for default behavior to throw an exception if a coordinate is received with any more than 2 elements.  There are a few \"user-friendly\" questions surrounding this (which have cropped up more than once on the issue list)\n1. Should another validation parameter be added to optionally fail on coordinates > 2d?\n2. Should it be part of the existing 'validate' parameter?\n3. Should the default throw an exception for >2d coordinates forcing users to set the parameter to handle pre-existing geojson data? \n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
