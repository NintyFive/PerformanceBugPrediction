common use case that will benefit from extending support for aliases is shared indices with routing.  Would be helpful to be able to generate these dynamically using a template (for some deployments, can be thousands+ of them).\n\n```\nPOST /_aliases\n{ \n\"actions\": [{ \n\"add\": { \n\"index\": \"sales\", \n\"alias\": sales_<CUST_ID>, \n\"filter\": {\"term\": {\"customer_id\": <CUST_ID>}}, \n\"routing\": <CUST_ID> \n} \n}] \n}\n```\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/156392434","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5359#issuecomment-156392434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5359","id":156392434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjM5MjQzNA==","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-13T10:34:40Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T10:34:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@martijnvg has this issue been solved by https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/12209 ?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/156406448","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5359#issuecomment-156406448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5359","id":156406448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjQwNjQ0OA==","user":{"login":"barravi","id":1453856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTM4NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1453856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/barravi","html_url":"https://github.com/barravi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barravi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barravi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barravi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barravi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barravi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barravi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barravi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barravi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barravi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-13T11:43:56Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T11:43:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Partly yes, and I'm sure it would solve my immediate issue.\n\nMore interesting would be to extend the concept, and have capturing groups in the name regex for index templates, so to be able to reuse part of the index name in the alias definition.
