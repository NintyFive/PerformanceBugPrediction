You missed something indeed. Actually the lowercase filter does not seem to work when using a template for +logs*.\n\nUsing the EXACT SAME template that you posted above, I inserted another message like so:\n\ncurl -X PUT 'localhost:9200/logs-20130820/bar/2?refresh=true' -d '{\n    \"@time\" : \"2013-01-01\",\n    \"@message\":\"This is such a Rude Message my Dear Donny\",\n    \"@fields\" : { \"a\":\"this is not sparta, but a\", \"b\":\"oh, look, that is b\"} \n}'\n{\"ok\":true,\"_index\":\"logs-20130820\",\"_type\":\"bar\",\"_id\":\"2\",\"_version\":1}\n\nThen:\n\ncurl -X GET 'localhost:9200/logs-20130820/bar/_search?q=rude'\n{\"took\":5,\"timed_out\":false,\"_shards\":{\"total\":1,\"successful\":1,\"failed\":0},\"hits\":{\"total\":0,\"max_score\":null,\"hits\":[]}}\n\nThe lowercase filter should have been applied, apparently this is not the case.\n\nWhen I do this:\n\ncurl -X GET 'localhost:9200/logs-20130820/bar/_search?q=Rude'\n{\"took\":4,\"timed_out\":false,\"_shards\":{\"total\":1,\"successful\":1,\"failed\":0},\"hits\":{\"total\":1,\"max_score\":0.3125,\"hits\":[{\"_index\":\"logs-20130820\",\"_type\":\"bar\",\"_id\":\"2\",\"_score\":0.3125, \"_source\" : {\n    \"@time\" : \"2013-01-01\",\n    \"@message\":\"This is such a Rude Message my Dear Donny\",\n    \"@fields\" : { \"a\":\"this is not sparta, but a\", \"b\":\"oh, look, that is b\"} \n}}]}}\n\n... we do get an answer.\n\nNote however, that I am using Elasticsearch 0.90.0. Tomorrow I will try the same thing using the latest version (0.90.3).\n\nNote also, that changing the template name for the created indexes to \"+lgs*\" produces the desired results.\n\nThanks for your support,\n- Chris\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/26348131","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3080#issuecomment-26348131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/3080","id":26348131,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzQ4MTMx","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-15T16:06:59Z","updated_at":"2013-10-15T16:06:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hey,\n\ndid you have any success reproducing this with 0.90.5?
