Overall we treat documentation as code, which means that documentation falls under the same license as the other code with which it resides. For example, the docs in the `elasticsearch/docs` directory are licensed under Apache 2.0.\r\n\r\nHopefully that helps resolve your issue, please let us know if anything is still unclear.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/455769123","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37616#issuecomment-455769123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37616","id":455769123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTc2OTEyMw==","user":{"login":"DaveCTurner","id":5058284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5058284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveCTurner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveCTurner/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-19T10:43:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-19T10:43:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also asked on [the discussion forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/documentation-license/164852) which I think is a better place for any follow-up discussion.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
