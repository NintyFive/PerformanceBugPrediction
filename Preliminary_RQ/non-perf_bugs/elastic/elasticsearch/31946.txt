6.2 and earlier, the `x-pack-transport` POM had a dependency on `x-pack-api` which pulled in 3rd party dependencies such as the UnboundId LDAP SDK and Bouncy Castle (for reading TLS keys)\r\n\r\nThe (abbreviated) dependency tree was:\r\n```\r\n+- org.elasticsearch.client:x-pack-transport:jar:6.2.4:compile\r\n|  +- org.elasticsearch.plugin:x-pack-api:jar:6.2.4:compile\r\n|  |  +- com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk:jar:3.2.0:compile\r\n|  |  +- org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:jar:1.58:compile\r\n|  |  +- org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk15on:jar:1.58:compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince 6.3 the `x-pack-api` POM no longer exists, and `x-pack-transport` simply depends on `x-pack-core` which does not include any 3rd party dependencies.\r\nAs far as I can tell from grepping, none of our generated POM files include a dependency for the ldapsdk (nor, I assume, bouncy castle).\r\n\r\nThis means that the [published dependency in our docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/setup-xpack-client.html) is insufficient\r\n```\r\n <dependencies>\r\n      <!-- add the x-pack jar as a dependency -->\r\n      <dependency>\r\n         <groupId>org.elasticsearch.client</groupId>\r\n         <artifactId>x-pack-transport</artifactId>\r\n              <version>{version}</version>\r\n      </dependency>\r\n      ...\r\n   </dependencies>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a qa test for transport client with ML, but because it uses gradle with local project dependencies, it pulls in the transitive dependency list from x-pack-core including the LDAP sdk, etc\r\n```\r\n+--- project :x-pack:plugin:core\r\n|    [ snip ]\r\n|    +--- com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk:3.2.0\r\n|    +---
