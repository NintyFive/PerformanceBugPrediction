It has complications (eg what happens if all nodes are recovering from each other?).  Really, it shouldn't be necessary.  Recovery should be throttled so there are sufficient resources on the box to handle search requests etc as well.  (This also means providing enough hardware so that your nodes are not at breaking point already, and ensuring that there aren't abusive search requests - something we're trying help with in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11511)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/170924663","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15914#issuecomment-170924663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/15914","id":170924663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDkyNDY2Mw==","user":{"login":"nirajpatel","id":3387076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODcwNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3387076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirajpatel","html_url":"https://github.com/nirajpatel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirajpatel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirajpatel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirajpatel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirajpatel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirajpatel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirajpatel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirajpatel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirajpatel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirajpatel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-12T14:18:42Z","updated_at":"2016-01-12T14:19:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you so much for responding @clintongormley! That certainly makes sense. I was thinking more on the transport client side while the cluster is recovering we could at least throttle requests. \n\n**Recovery should be throttled so there are sufficient resources on the box to handle search requests etc as well.**\nRecovery being throttled would mean higher search, GET, indexing times for an extended period of time correct? Wouldn't you almost want to favor recovering quickly over servicing incoming requests normally? I guess it's a personal tradeoff but if the option existed in the transport client the user could make that decision. What are your thoughts?
