Can you explain, which performance exactly you intend to improve? Right now the datastructure used there is a list. We could possibly use a set to prevent duplicate or use a HPPC collection to be more garbage collection friendly/faster. Is this what you mean with better merging performance?\n\nAlso wondering how much ids you intend to put into a single request. Keep in mind, that you will need to get the data from elasticsearch and return it to the client. It might not be a good idea to get several million entries per request.\n\nAny helping comments are greatly appreciated here! Thanks a lot!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/77954692","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5089#issuecomment-77954692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5089","id":77954692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTU0Njky","user":{"login":"nfx","id":259697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTY5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/259697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfx","html_url":"https://github.com/nfx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nfx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-09T22:08:58Z","updated_at":"2015-03-09T22:08:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It's just for the ease of use - applications collect ids as lists and it's easier to pass them directly inside of method calls\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
