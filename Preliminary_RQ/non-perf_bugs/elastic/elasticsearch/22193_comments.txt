The `rename` does the job just fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST _ingest/pipeline/_simulate\r\n{\r\n  \"pipeline\": {\r\n    \"processors\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"rename\": {\r\n          \"field\": \"usergroup_group_name\",\r\n          \"target_field\": \"usergroup.group_name\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"docs\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"_source\": {\r\n        \"usergroup_group_name\": \"foo\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, the exception says `\"[group_name] is not an integer, cannot be used as an index as part of path [usergroup.group_name]\"` so for some reason, it is expecting `group_name` to be an integer. perhaps you have this field mapped incorrectly?\r\n\r\nYou haven't provided enough info for us to be able to recreate this issue, but (as I demonstrate above) what you're trying to do works just fine, so I'm going to close this issue.  If you have further questions I'd suggest asking them in the forums: https://discuss.elastic.co","performed_via_github_app":null}]
