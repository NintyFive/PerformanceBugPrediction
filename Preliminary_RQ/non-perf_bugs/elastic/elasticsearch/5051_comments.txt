There are many reasons why the OOM could have happened, only some of which might actually have been caused by recovery.  The shard size itself shouldn't be a problem.

May be worth logging at DEBUG instead of INFO.  The OOM may be coming from something completely unrelated to recovery.  Are you querying at the same time, or is it just during recovery? Also, I'd be interested to know if you see the same thing on 1.3  (released today)\n\nthanks\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/56999925","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5051#issuecomment-56999925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5051","id":56999925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTk5OTI1","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-26T18:15:06Z","updated_at":"2014-09-26T18:15:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any more info @msonnabaum ?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/62368944","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5051#issuecomment-62368944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5051","id":62368944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzY4OTQ0","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-10T10:55:19Z","updated_at":"2014-11-10T10:55:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No more feedback, so closing.
