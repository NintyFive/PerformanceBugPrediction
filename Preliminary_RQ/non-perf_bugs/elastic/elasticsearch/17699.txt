When calling this method in a test the same `NodeAndClient` is returned (since the nodes are sorted and the last one is always the last one)\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Run an ESIntegTestCase test with few nodes\n2. Call `internalTestCluster.smartClient()` many times\n3. Always get the same `NodeAndClient`\n","closed_by":{"login":"bbrutman","id":11177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTc3ODE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrutman","html_url":"https://github.com/bbrutman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrutman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrutman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrutman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrutman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrutman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrutman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrutman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrutman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrutman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
