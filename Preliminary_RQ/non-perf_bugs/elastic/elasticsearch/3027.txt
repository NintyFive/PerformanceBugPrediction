This is a feature supported by HTTP, as http://www.elasticsearch.org/2011/02/08/versioning/ show an update example with a version parameter.\n\nAlso, Just to clarify, when I read http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/update/ :\n\n\"this operation still means full reindex of the document, it just removes some network roundtrips and reduces chances of version conflicts between the get and the index\"\n\n; I assume the 'get' and 'index' are between ES and lucene, rather than between my client and ES? Otherwise I can't see what roundtrips are saved.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
