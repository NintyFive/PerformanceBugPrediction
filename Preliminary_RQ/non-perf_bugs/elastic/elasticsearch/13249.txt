However, I've found that when allowing it to work based on `index.creation_date` (the default mechanism), it does it in the reverse of the expected order **relative to replicas**.\n\nIt's easy enough to reproduce with enough daily indices by manually deleting the replicas from one node, throttling the heck out of recovery, and speeding up monitoring:\n\n``` http\nPUT /_cluster/settings\n{\n  \"transient\": {\n    \"cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries\" : 1,\n    \"indices.recovery.concurrent_streams\" : 1,\n    \"indices.recovery.concurrent_small_file_streams\" : 1,\n    \"indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec\" : \"1mb\",\n    \"marvel.agent.interval\" : \"500ms\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs I was watching it, I decided to take some screenshots:\n1. ![Reversed Priority 1 of 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1501235/9609848/04e554c2-50a4-11e5-9984-0175a05bc146.png)\n2. ![Reversed Priority 2 of 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1501235/9609849/04e56f20-50a4-11e5-861b-d7f108bca25b.png)\n\nThis also appears to not be honoring the `index.priority` either, as I tried to use it as a workaround and it did not impact the recovery order at all, which makes me assume that this is not even coming into play during replica recovery.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
