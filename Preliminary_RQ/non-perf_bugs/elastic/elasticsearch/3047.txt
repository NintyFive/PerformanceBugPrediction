The format is:\n\n\"E, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z\"\ne.g.\n\"Wed, 06 Dec 2000 02:55:00 -0800\"\n\nE is locale dependent, in the German locale, it is \"Mi\" (afaik, its certainly not \"Wed\"). Parsing this date fails with `de_DE.UTF-8` and succeeds with `en_US.UTF-8` as environment setting. Sadly, this is not settable for date parsing, e.g.:\n\n```\n\"type\" : \"date\",\n\"format\" : \"E, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z\",\n\"locale\" : \"US\"\n```\n\n(where locale is a java.util.Locale)\n\nThis means that elasticsearch can only ever parse dates in one format per cluster.
