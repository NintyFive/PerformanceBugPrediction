you need to monitor how much heap is used by calling [/_nodes/stats](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/admin-cluster-nodes-stats.html). You should monitor the nodes as you increase the load and make sure that you always have enough memory. The [installation guide](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/setup/installation.html) describes how to increase heap size. We also have a guide that describes [how you can get help with elasticsearch problems](http://www.elasticsearch.org/help/). Since this is not really a bug, I am going to close this issue.
