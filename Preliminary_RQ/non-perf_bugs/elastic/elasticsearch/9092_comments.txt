This requires a careful balance of improving early termination of bad queries without slowing search speeds of good queries with additional timer checks.\n\nThere will be no change to the client interface - just improved detection of overruns.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68518839","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9092#issuecomment-68518839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/9092","id":68518839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NTE4ODM5","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-02T10:43:26Z","updated_at":"2015-01-02T10:43:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing in favour of #4586\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
