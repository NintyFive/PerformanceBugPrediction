useful in certain circumstances in the back end log file, I think the solution is to use Elasticsearch's `root_cause` logic such that the full exception report contains the reason but _not_ in the most deeply nested `ElasticsearchException`.  The most deeply nested `ElasticsearchException` is considered the `root_cause`, and is what gets displayed in the UI.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/384132699","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29950#issuecomment-384132699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/29950","id":384132699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDEzMjY5OQ==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T12:04:07Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T01:32:41Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"*Original comment by @sophiec20:*\n\nAfter the 6.1 additions for checking established model memory, I now experience this error message more often. This is because I open and close a lot of jobs repeatedly. These may or may not have an established model memory, and all my scripts currently use the default 1GB. These conditions should be less likely in a production environment, although there may be evaluation users who are also impacted.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of an error message if there is no available node to open the job on.
