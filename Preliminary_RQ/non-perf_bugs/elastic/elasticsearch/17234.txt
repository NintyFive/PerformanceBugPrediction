Basically I have write and read aliases on an index, with filter and routing specified. Based on some criteria, I need to modify the aliases to point to a new index, at which time, I remove the write alias from the existing index, move it to the newly created index and at the same add the same read alias to the newly created index. I am using update_aliases api in the python client to perform all three operations atomically.\n\n_Expected behaviour_: The write alias should be removed from the old index and start pointing to the new index, while containing the filter and routing specified.\n\n_Observed behaviour_: The write alias is removed from the old index, added to the new index but doesnt contain the specified filter. Attaching code snippets in steps to reproduce.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n- Apply alias actions:\n\n```\nactions = {}\nactions['actions'] = [{'remove': {'index': u'goibibo_201612', 'alias': u'w_goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612'}}, {'add': {'filter': {'term': {'primaryName': u'goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess'}}, 'index': u'goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612', 'alias': u'w_goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612'}}, {'add': {'filter': {'term': {'primaryName': u'goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess'}}, 'index': u'goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612', 'alias': u'r_goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612'}}]\nes.indices.update_aliases(body=actions)\n```\n- Fetch alias (should contain the filter, but doesnt)\n\n```\nes.indices.get_alias(name='w_goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612')\n\n{u'goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612': {u'aliases': {u'w_goibibo-serviceresponsesuccess_201612': {}}}}\n```\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\nDidn't see any error logs in master node\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
