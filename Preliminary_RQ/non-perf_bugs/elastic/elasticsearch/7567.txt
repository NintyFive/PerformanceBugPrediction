Those parameters can only be set through java api though, never parsed on the REST layer.\n\nThe set preference is also never used internally as we force the preference to `_local` all the time. Also, I wonder if `realtime` and `refresh` make sense since we always refresh internally after each write (put/delete indexed script).\n\nMy vote is for removing all three parameters from the java API.\n","closed_by":{"login":"GaelTadh","id":5190064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTAwNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5190064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh","html_url":"https://github.com/GaelTadh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
