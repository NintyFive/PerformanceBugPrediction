Another possibility is the `skip` functionality. We can skip tests if some condition isn't met (the condition itself needs to be coded into the test runner).  For instance, we can skip the scripting tests if groovy scripting isn't enabled, by running a pre-check to determine whether a simple groovy script can execute. \n\nCould add the same thing to skip this test if no node attributes are defined.
