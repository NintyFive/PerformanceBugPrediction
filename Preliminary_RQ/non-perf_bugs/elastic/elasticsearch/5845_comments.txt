What changed is just that some lightweight compression has been added to stored fields and term vectors (the terms dictionary, live docs and postings lists were already compressed).\n\nDepending on your needs, I think you should either solely rely on the compression that is performed at the Elaticsearch level (which has the advantage of knowing the data it is being applied to, efficient compression algorithms for postings lists (sorted integers) are completely different from those for the terms dictionary (sorted strings) or stored fields (random strings)) or add ZFS compression on top of it if you want to trade CPU for disk space.\n\nAdding ZFS compression on top of Elasticsearch compression makes sense if you are using an algorithm that has different characteristics from the one that are being used by Elasticsearch (eg. gzip), but it can also make sense if you use an algorithm from the LZ family, that elasticsearch uses for stored fields/term vectors and that seems to be the default as well for ZFS. See for instance this [blog post](http://fastcompression.blogspot.fr/2012/07/log-file-compression.html) that suggests that LZ\\* algorithms work very well when applied several times on highly-compressible content.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/54612151","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5845#issuecomment-54612151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5845","id":54612151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjEyMTUx","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-05T11:07:32Z","updated_at":"2014-09-05T11:07:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am closing this issue because we don't want to offer too many option that would make backward compatibility hard to maintain.\n\nHowever, we might still want to have two options for compression: one that would compress data more efficiently than today, and one that would be much lighter.
