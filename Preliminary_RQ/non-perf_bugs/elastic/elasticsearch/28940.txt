I am following the ES documentation here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/docker.html#docker-cli-run\r\n\r\nOpenShift 3.5 follows specific syntax regarding environment variable names.  It requires that a variable name be an alphanumeric (a-z and 0-9) string beginning with a letter that may contain underscores.  \"discovery.type\" does not follow these rules.  \r\n\r\nI have also seen many articles describe that the syntax of environment variables should follow alpha-numeric and underscores as well (no periods).\r\n\r\nAre you aware of such a convention?  Is there an opportunity to change the name of environment variables to use underscores and not periods?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
