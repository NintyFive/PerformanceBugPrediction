You should ask your question in the forum directly:\r\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch\r\n\r\nRegarding your issue 'lt' stands for \"lesser than\" so if you have `lt: 1485851711.686809` documents with that value are not returned. If you change `lt` to `lte` then the two documents should show up. Though you're not creating the documents correctly. Doing:\r\n````\r\ncurl -X PUT <elastic-host><index_name>/1/_create -d'{\"analysis_time\":1485851710.686809}\r\n````\r\nmeans that you put a document in the index `index_name` with type set to `1`. The `_id` of the document is the last part of the path so in your recreation it will be `_create`. This `_id` is a unique identifier in this index so when you try to put a second document with the same `_id` it will remove the first version and replace it with the new document.
