Sometimes that  cluster state is processed by the target node first  and only then by the source node. The target node then initiates the recovery by sending a message to the source node. If that message arrives before the source node has processed the cluster state, it will respond with a `DelayRecoveryException`. This should only tell the target node to retry in a few seconds and is just part of the normal process.\n\nSadly in your case something goes wrong with the serialization of the DelayRecoveryException , which causes a different `NotSerializableTransportException` to be sent. The target node then cancels the recovery as it doesn't know what went wrong. Can you check if there is anything in the source node logs that would hint what wasn't serializable? Sadly we don't do a really good job indicating this in 1.7. In 2.0 exception serialization was completely rewritten to help with these issues.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/176952294","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14338#issuecomment-176952294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14338","id":176952294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Njk1MjI5NA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-29T20:21:29Z","updated_at":"2016-01-29T20:21:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No further feedback.
