So, it can be set to `64mb`, but it does not take into account the number fo total shards allocated on the nodes. For example, if there is a single shard, and we have plenty of memory, then we should set it to a higher value, and if there are a lot of shards, this should be set to a lower value.\n\nA global management of the indexing buffer size should be maintained, with the ability to set the memory used for indexing as either a value or a percent of the allocated memory to the jvm, across all shards.\n\nThe setting is called `indices.memory.index_buffer_size`, and it defaults to `40%`. It can either be set to a percent value (with `%` suffix), or a byte size value (for example `1.5gb`).\n\nThe default of the setting is `40%`.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
