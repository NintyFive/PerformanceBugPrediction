We create an index and change the default analyzer to use English stopwords:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT /simp_idx\r\n{\r\n  \"mappings\": {\r\n    \"my_type\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n  \t\t\"field_1\": {\r\n    \t\t\t\"type\": \"text\"\r\n    \t\t}\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \t\"settings\": {\r\n\t\t\"number_of_shards\": 1,\r\n\t\t\"number_of_replicas\": 0,\r\n\t\t\"analysis\": {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\"filter\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"english_stop\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"stop\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"stopwords\": \"_english_\"\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\"analyzer\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"default\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"tokenizer\": \"standard\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"filter\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"english_stop\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then populate it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUT /simp_idx/my_type/1\r\n{\r\n  \"field_1\": \"place of beauty\"\r\n}\r\nPUT /simp_idx/my_type/2\r\n{\r\n  \"field_1\": \"place and beauty\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if we query this with the regular query_string, we get the expected two results:\r\n```\r\nGET /simp_idx/my_type/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"query_string\" : {\r\n        \"query\": \"place of\",\r\n        \"default_operator\": \"and\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the same query using simple-query-string and the AND operator finds no results:\r\n```\r\nGET /simp_idx/my_type/_search\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"simple_query_string\" : {\r\n        \"query\": \"place of\",\r\n\t\t\t\"fields\": [ \"field_1\"],\r\n        \"default_operator\": \"and\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nRemove the \"of\" from the query and it will work as expected.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is intentional because the SQS is \"simple\", but it's not documented on the SQS page - the only explicitly stated difference is no exception raising. Seems like a bug though, hence the report.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
