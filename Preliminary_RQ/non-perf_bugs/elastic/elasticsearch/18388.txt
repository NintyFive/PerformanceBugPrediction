It seems that elastic missed 'modifier symbol' in symbol matcher. I found code in CharMatcher.java:\n`SYMBOL {`\n`@Override`\n            `public boolean isTokenChar(int c) {`\n                `switch (Character.getType(c)) {`\n                `case Character.CURRENCY_SYMBOL:`\n                `case Character.MATH_SYMBOL:`\n                `case Character.OTHER_SYMBOL:`\n                    `return true;`\n                `default:`\n                     `return false;`\n                `}`\n           `}`\n        `}`\nAppearently Character.MODIFIER_SYMBOL is missing here.
