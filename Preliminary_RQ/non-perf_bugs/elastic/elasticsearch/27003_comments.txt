Can you give me a little more information with the code that does the alias creation? Does this index already exist, or are you creating it in the code as well? If you are creating it, then please post as much of that code as well. \r\n\r\nIf this is an existing index, I would like to know what the values of the strings in the above snippet for the index and alias variables, just to remove anything funky. \r\n\r\nCan you show the output of `_cat/indices` and `_aliases` as well?
