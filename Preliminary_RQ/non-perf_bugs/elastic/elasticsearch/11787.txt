Something akin to:\n\n```\n$ curl -XPUT host:9200/my-index/_settings -d '{\n  \"index.priority\" : 1\n}'\n```\n\nBy default, all priorities would default with `index.priority : 0`, thus being of equal priority unless modified. From there, the comparison could go to index creation date/time as the next priority level, then finally by name for the final order.\n\n> `index.priority` > `index.creation_date` > reverse sorted index name\n\nThis allows pretty much every use case to specify recovery order for best-case recovery order for their use case. Time-based solutions would pretty much work out of the box because the creation date would prioritize recovery of _today's_ index first, thus giving the best chance to return to fully replicated indexing as soon as possible. Similarly, falling back to the reverse sorted index name gives arbitrary--yet predictable--sorting for simultaneously-created indices (however unlikely) that have no time basis (`index-z`, `index-y`, ...), but YMD-formatted date/time strings will properly sort (`logstash-2015.05.03` will always come before `logstash-2015.05.02` or earlier dates). Finally, the arbitrary priority allows users to take control of the process for cases where there is no time basis, such as when a \"main\" index is created, but then minor indices are created from time-to-time. Even better, this would be as simple as setting it once with a high value, then not setting or selectively setting the minor indices.\n","closed_by":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
