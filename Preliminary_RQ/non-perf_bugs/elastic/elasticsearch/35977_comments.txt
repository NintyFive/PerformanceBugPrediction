It is an expert query that is used internally to resolve phrase queries with synonyms or phrase prefix queries but otherwise you should be able to use a mixed of `span_or` and `span_near` queries to perform the same. MultiPhraseQuery and spans should also be similar in terms of scoring and we don't have strong evidence that shows that a MultiPhraseQuery is faster.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
