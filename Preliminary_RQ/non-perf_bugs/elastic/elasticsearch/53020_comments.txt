This should help to forward exact match queries to specific field types.\r\n\r\nI am closing this issue as we don't plan to introduce any generalized approach on ES side. There will NO be special exact_match query. Please reopen if there is a plan to do something general for query languages.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
