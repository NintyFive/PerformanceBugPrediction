If you create a `nested` `query` and also supply the `filter`, then the `filter` is silently ignored. If you do not supply the `query`, then the `filter` is used as you would expect.\n\nThis issue is present in both ES 1.x and 2.x.\n\n``` http\nPUT /test\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"skills\": {\n          \"type\": \"nested\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"skill_id\": {\n              \"type\": \"integer\"\n            },\n            \"recommendations_count\": {\n              \"type\": \"integer\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT /test/user/1\n{\n   \"name\": \"John\",\n   \"skills\": [\n      {\n         \"skill_id\": 100,\n         \"recommendations_count\": 5\n      },\n      {\n         \"skill_id\": 200,\n         \"recommendations_count\": 3\n      }\n   ]\n}\n\nPUT /test/user/2\n{\n   \"name\": \"Mary\",\n   \"skills\": [\n      {\n         \"skill_id\": 100,\n         \"recommendations_count\": 9\n      },\n      {\n         \"skill_id\": 200,\n         \"recommendations_count\": 0\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nFollowed by:\n\n``` http\nGET /test/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"nested\": {\n      \"path\": \"skills\",\n      \"query\": {\n        \"function_score\": {\n          \"functions\": [\n            {\n              \"field_value_factor\": {\n                \"field\": \"skills.recommendations_count\",\n                \"factor\": 1.2,\n                \"modifier\": \"sqrt\",\n                \"missing\": 1\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      },\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"term\": {\n          \"skills.skill_id\": 100\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNoting the `filter`, the `skill_id` filter works even if the value does not exist (e.g., 500).
