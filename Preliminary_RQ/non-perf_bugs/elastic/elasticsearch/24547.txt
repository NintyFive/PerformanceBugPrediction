Setting the right value for the `slices` parameter is a little involved but we have documented [guidelines](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html#docs-reindex-picking-slices).\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\n\r\nIs it worth implementing something like `?slices=auto`? We can do a fairly good job picking the number of slices with something simple like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (sourceIndex.numberOfShards > 50) {\r\n  slices = 1; // too big, user should optimize it by hand.\r\n} else {\r\n  slices = sourceIndex.numberOfShards;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe point here is that `?slices=auto` can be a sane default. Maybe, even, it could *be* the default in 6.0.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
