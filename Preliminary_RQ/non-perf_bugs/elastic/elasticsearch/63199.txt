I would expect the request to be successful and return the error. This works as expected **without** `verbose` enabled.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. Create a pipeline:\r\n```\r\nPUT _ingest/pipeline/pipeline_expected_to_fail\r\n{\r\n   \"description\": \"_description\",\r\n    \"processors\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"rename\": {\r\n          \"field\": \"dont_exist\",\r\n          \"target_field\": \"field1\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 2. Create a second pipeline that defines a `pipeline` processor with the pipeline created in step 1. For example:\r\n```\r\nPUT _ingest/pipeline/my_pipeline\r\n{\r\n   \"description\": \"_description\",\r\n    \"processors\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"set\" : {\r\n          \"field\" : \"field2\",\r\n          \"value\" : \"_value\"\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"pipeline\" : {\r\n          \"name\": \"pipeline_expected_to_fail\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n 3. Run the simulate API with verbose enabled against the pipeline created in step 2.\r\n```\r\nPOST /_ingest/pipeline/my_pipeline/_simulate?verbose\r\n{\r\n  \"docs\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"_index\": \"index\",\r\n      \"_id\": \"id\",\r\n      \"_source\": {\r\n        \"foo\": \"bar\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Note the request results in: `{\"statusCode\":502,\"error\":\"Bad Gateway\",\"message\":\"Client request timeout\"}`\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"danhermann","id":22777892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzc3ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22777892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann","html_url":"https://github.com/danhermann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
