This mode should be:\r\n* controlled by a query parameter (vs. auto-detection);\r\n* extended to have the aliases also reported as `table` (vs. current `alias`);\r\n* enabled by default.\r\n\r\nThis would allow users of BI tools to gain visibility into all existing indexes and aliases, since these tools ignore aliases when presenting the user with the list of objects available to query.\r\n\r\nFor those (fewer/less_relevant) tools that do a complete catalog listing, the drivers would implement a config parameter which would trigger back the transparent reporting (i.e. `base table`, `alias`).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"costin","id":76245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/76245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin","html_url":"https://github.com/costin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/costin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
