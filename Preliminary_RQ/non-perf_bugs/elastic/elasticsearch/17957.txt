However, if you try to get the same value using the MultiGet API it fails as it treats the index name as a concrete index name rather than allowing for the possibility that it could be an expression. I think the behavior of the APIs should be consistent.\n\nI tend to question the usefulness of the date math expression in a get request. I could see one scenario where you know the id of a document (the id is consistent) and want to get the \"current\" one using a date math expression.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
