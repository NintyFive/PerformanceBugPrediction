I was able to make this work and produce an XML file, but it just reports the licenses of every dep. This seems helpful though.\n- apache whisker (http://creadur.apache.org/whisker/) has the goal of maintaining NOTICE/LICENSE type documentation in mind. However, I was unable to make it work at all. In its current state (0.1-snapshot, etc) I was unable to get past all the barriers, like configuring custom .m2/settings that allows its plugin prefix and making this work with the apache snapshot repository.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/95323122","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10684#issuecomment-95323122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10684","id":95323122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk1MzIzMTIy","user":{"login":"mrsolo","id":96771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2Nzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/96771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrsolo","html_url":"https://github.com/mrsolo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrsolo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrsolo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrsolo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrsolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrsolo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrsolo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrsolo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrsolo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrsolo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-22T20:13:58Z","updated_at":"2015-04-22T20:13:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We use https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/pom.xml#L1753 license profile when doing license analysis which is essentially revert back to http://mojo.codehaus.org/license-maven-plugin/\n\n'mvn site' will generate all kind of goodies, including third party dependencies\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/97510950","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10684#issuecomment-97510950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10684","id":97510950,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3NTEwOTUw","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-29T17:23:03Z","updated_at":"2015-04-29T17:23:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've been trying to automate this with http://mojo.codehaus.org/license-maven-plugin/ but I have a few questions:\n- If three dependencies all use the BSD 3-clause license, do we need to distribute one copy of the BSD 3 -clause license, or 3 individual copies, each one with the copyright details filled in?\n- We don't redistribute the source of the dependencies, so i assume we only need to distribute the licenses in the compiled version?\n- We can generate a NOTICE file for our dependencies, but it looks like we have to include the NOTICE file from each dependency as well (see http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html#redistribution).
