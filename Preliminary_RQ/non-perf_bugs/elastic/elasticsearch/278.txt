The declaration looks as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    \"pin\" : {\n        \"properties\" : {\n            \"location\" : {\n                \"type\" : \"geo_point\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n## Input Structure\n\nThe above mapping defines a `geo_point`, which accepts different formats. The following formats are supported:\n\n_Lat Lon As Properties_\n\n```\n{\n    \"pin\" : {\n        \"location\" : {\n            \"lat\" : 40.12,\n            \"lon\" : -71.34\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n_Lat Lon As Array_\n\n```\n{\n    \"pin\" : {\n        \"location\" : [40.12, -71.34]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n_Lat Lon As String_\n\n```\n{\n    \"pin\" : {\n        \"location\" : \"41.12,-71.34\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n_Geohash_\n\n```\n{\n    \"pin\" : {\n        \"location\" : \"drm3btev3e86\"\n    }\n}\n```\n## Index Fields\n\nThe `geo_point` type creates two floating point fields, called `lat` and `lon`. In our example above, two fields will be create, the first `location.lat` and the second is `location.lon`. Though probably not needed, there is an option also to create a third field called `geohash` with the `geohash` value (represented as `location.geohash`). In most cases, those specific fields are not needed when using geo capabilities, and only `location` will be needed (for example, with `geo_distance` filter).\n## Mapping Options\n- `resolution`: controls the floating point resolution of the stored fields. Defaults to `64`, but can also be `32`.\n- `geohash`: set to `true` to store also the geohash in the index. defaults to `false`.\n- `geohash_precision`: sets the geohash precision, defaults to `12`.\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
