This rather sounds like a usage bug, where  things sometimes work based on timing.\r\n\r\n> I think if I enable the auto_shrink_voting_configuration, the cluster can elect a new master node if there are still more than 3 nodes in this cluster. Therefore, I create a cluster with 6 nodes and then destroy 3 nodes of them (include master node). The cluster dead.\r\n\r\nThis is the expected behavior. Shutting down half or more of the master-eligible nodes at once will make your cluster unavailable.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn any case, this is more like a user question than a bug, which is better clarified at discuss.elastic.co","performed_via_github_app":null}]
