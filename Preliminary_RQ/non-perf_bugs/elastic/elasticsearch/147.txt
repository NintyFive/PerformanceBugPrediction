So quite often, I'm tailing the log, and I don't see the expected outcome.  This is because the log I'm tailing is actually from yesterday, and when it writes the new info, it rotates the log from under me.\n\nIf you were to write (eg) `---MARK---` every hour, then this would ensure that the logs belong to the correct day.\n\nAlternatively, just write to the logs at midnight\n\nta\n\nclint\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
