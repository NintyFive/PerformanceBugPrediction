This syntax will produce IndexOutOfBoundsException if you are trying to add element outside of the current lists length. Instead you should add new clauses using `SpanNearQueryBuilder clause(SpanQueryBuilder clause)`.\n\nAs a side note, I couldn't reproduce with your code snippet above, this doesn't seem to be using the Java-API since those methods wouldn't accept floats (`1F`) as argument for slop and list index. Are you using another client by any chance?\n\nAs far as I can see this is not a bug in ES but rather wrong usage of the API. We should not allow adding directly to the clauses list obtained by `SpanNearQueryBuilder#clauses()` but rather make that one a read-only unmodifiable list. Also we should probably add documentation and rename `clause(SpanQueryBuilder clause)` to `addClause(SpanQueryBuilder clause)` to avoid future confusions like this.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/220651572","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18478#issuecomment-220651572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18478","id":220651572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDY1MTU3Mg==","user":{"login":"cashel1","id":10799613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzk5NjEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10799613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashel1","html_url":"https://github.com/cashel1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashel1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashel1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashel1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashel1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashel1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashel1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashel1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashel1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashel1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T16:20:03Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T16:20:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, on the slop, this was a lazy attempt on my part to eliminate the variable from the post.    \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
