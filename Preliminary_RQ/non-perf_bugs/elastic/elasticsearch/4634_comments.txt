But I'm talking generally and not just in this particular change.  Over the last 2 months it is more common to find plugins that are not currently load-able or run-able (even if loading) or sometimes just in an unknown and untested state with current ES versions.  Obviously breaking changes have to happen sometimes along the way, but the rate seems to increase towards 1.0 rather than reduce towards stability.  So while ES might be more stable, the ecosystem around it seems more in disarray.  \n\nAnd even if a plugin works, the documentation doesn't make it clear if they will still load since they are not updated to reflect the top version supported.  Imagine a new ES user installing it, trying to use a plugin listed on the site but not seeing a matching version, and sometimes using one to find it doesn't work.  Does not lend credibility to the product.  I think this is my message, please keep that in mind (you likely are, but it feels less so from the \"outside\")\n\nI think it is a case where the speed of change has outpaced the open-source plugins writers ability or desire to keep up with the pace of change.\n\n(The previous collection class changes just introduced really odd feeling code to users of the Java client, that's a different story.
