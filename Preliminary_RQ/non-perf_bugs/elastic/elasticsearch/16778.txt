I use posting highlighter and set `require_field_match` to false. It used to work with 1.7 and it still works with plain highlighter in 2.2 but not with posting highlighter. My individual fields which I am highlighting have `\"index_options\": \"offsets\"` while my composite field do not. \n\nPostings highlighter works if I highlight and search the same field\n\nHere is an example of my highlight options on a query:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  \"number_of_fragments\": 0,\n  \"require_field_match\": false,\n  \"type\": \"postings\",\n  \"fields\": {\n    \"additionalInfo\": {},\n    \"advisor.team.acronym\": {},\n    \"comments\": {},\n    \"description\": {},\n    \"engagements.title\": {},\n    \"summary\": {},\n    \"teams.team.acronym\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"roytmana","id":2524911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjQ5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2524911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana","html_url":"https://github.com/roytmana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roytmana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
