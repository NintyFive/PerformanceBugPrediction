In this case and instance, the `_ccr/stats` field `number_of_queued_writes` correctly reports `65535`.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion would be to rename:\r\n`max_write_buffer_size` -> `max_subsequent_reads_into_write_buffer` or replace `subsequent` with `next` to make it shorter. Any other suggestion is welcome of course.","closed_by":{"login":"dliappis","id":1754575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTQ1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1754575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis","html_url":"https://github.com/dliappis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dliappis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
