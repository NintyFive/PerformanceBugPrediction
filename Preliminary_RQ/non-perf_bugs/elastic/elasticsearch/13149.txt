However, I would recommend making some changes at the same time:\n\nUse `locale` instead of `language`/ `country`/ `variant`, eg : \n- `en`\n- `en_US`\n- `de_DE@collation=phonebook`\n- `zh_CN@collation=pinyin`\n\nKeep `strength`, `rules`, `decomposition`, `alternate`, `case_level`, `case_first`, `numeric`, `variable_top`.\n\nIt looks like `hiraganaQuaternaryMode` is no longer used by ICU (but not sure about that)\n\nIf no locale is specified, then it should default to ULocale.ROOT (ie DUCET) rather than what it does currently, which is to default to the current locale active in the JVM.\n\nFinally, it would be good to add the `truncate` token filter into the analyzer so that users can truncate a potentially long original string into (eg) the first 10 characters, so that it uses less memory.\n\nNOTE: We need to check that binary sorting is supported correctly in Elasticsearch.  @jpountz thinks this is the case, but needs to be confirmed.\n\n_Copied from original issue: elastic/elasticsearch-analysis-icu#28_\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
