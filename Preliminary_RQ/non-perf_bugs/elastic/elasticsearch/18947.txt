The best place\nto ask a general question is at the Elastic Discourse forums at\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co. If you are in fact posting a bug report or\na feature request, please include one and only one of the below blocks\nin your new issue.\n-->\n\n<!--\nIf you are filing a bug report, please remove the below feature\nrequest block and provide responses for all of the below items.\n-->\n\n**Elasticsearch version**: 2.3.3\n\n**JVM version**: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_72-b15)\n\n**OS version**: Ubuntu 14.04\n\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**: After increasing the marvel.agent.interval to '60s', the marvel overview in Kibana shows search and index rates of all zeroes when the \"Last 1 hour\" interval is selected. When selecting the \"Last 4 hours\" interval, the index and search rate show sensible values. Expected would be that \"Last 1 hour\" shows proper values as well.\n\nThe API returns all zeroes for the 1 hour case in the `metrics.cluster_index_latency` for the `/indices` endpoint, so it's not a display issue. `curl'ing` by hand with a 2 hour interval shows that `metrics.cluster_index_latency` is populated with sensible values.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Change marvel.agent.interval to '60s' in elasticsearch.yml\n2. Delete all marvel indices\n3. Restart elasticsearch\n4. Visit marvel page after a few minutes with \"Last hour\" selected\n5. Search and Index rate show only 0/s\n6. Switch to \"Last 4 hours\" -> Search and Index rate look sensible\n\nLet me know if you need more info!\n\nThanks,\n   Arne\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
