I don't know. But that is something to look at. A. possible fix (if that is the issue) is to do some type assert loop for a few seconds to wait for all connections to be removed.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/433945637","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34990#issuecomment-433945637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34990","id":433945637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzk0NTYzNw==","user":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-29T15:05:28Z","updated_at":"2018-10-29T15:05:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Added a wait in #35038","performed_via_github_app":null}]
