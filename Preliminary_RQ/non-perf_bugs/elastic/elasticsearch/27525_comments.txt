It is easy to make this reproduce and this bug only exists in 5.x.\r\n\r\n@s1monw The problem here is we are not closing the releasable bytes stream output when we throw an exception before attaching a send listener to the channel so we leak. I would like to fix this by backporting #24927 to 5.6. This ensures that we always close the releasable whether or not we attached the send listener.
