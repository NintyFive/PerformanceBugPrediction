MAD is more resilient to outliers in a data set than the standard deviation. For example, the [breakdown point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics#Breakdown_point) of the median is 50% whilst the breakdown point of the mean is 0% as just one value is needed to deviate the mean value of a set of values. It would help very much to the analysis performed through Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"andyb-elastic","id":29205940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjA1OTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/29205940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic","html_url":"https://github.com/andyb-elastic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyb-elastic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
