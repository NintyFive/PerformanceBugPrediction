The vulnerability allows an attacker to construct Groovy scripts that escape the sandbox and execute shell commands as the user running the Elasticsearch Java VM.  \n\nWe have been assigned CVE-2015-1427 for this issue.\n\nVersions 1.3.8 and 1.4.3 disable sandboxing for Groovy by default.  As a consequence, dynamic script execution is disabled for Groovy.  In other words, inline Groovy scripts will not be accepted as part of a request, and will not be retrieved from the `.scripts` index.  Groovy scripts can still be used if they are stored in files in the `config/scripts` directory.\n\nUsers should upgrade to 1.3.8 or 1.4.3.  Users that do not want to upgrade can address the vulnerability by setting `script.groovy.sandbox.enabled` to `false` in `config/elasticsearch.yml` and restarting the node.  \n\nGroovy dynamic scripting disabled in:\n- 1.3:  69735b0f4ab9ad7df4b82e8c917589b52cb9978c\n- 1.4: 4e952b2d75de6ca4caf4b6743462714f3b60d07f\n- 1.x: 716f0b24dc5414616e8dc0590dbfcfa0081be892\n- master: 764fda6420a0aa10db4abef15429b5e77b9be8bf\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
