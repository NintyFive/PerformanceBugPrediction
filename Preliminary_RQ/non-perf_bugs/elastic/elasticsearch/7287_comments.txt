How do you plan to use this low level information (as opposed to the values exposed via the stats APIs)?\n\nWe could potentially add this level of information to the slow query log. \n\nOf course, logging itself adds overhead.  I'm also wondering if we should look at exposing percentiles in our stats APIs as well as just the totals. \n\nWould be interested in hearing more about your use case.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68395003","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7287#issuecomment-68395003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7287","id":68395003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Mzk1MDAz","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-30T20:31:03Z","updated_at":"2014-12-30T20:31:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No further info provided.
