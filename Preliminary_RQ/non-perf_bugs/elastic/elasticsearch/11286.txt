A few of my indexes were set to read-only -- that is, `blocks.read_only` was set to true.\n\nI upgraded to 1.5.2. Various end-points, like `/_aliases` and `/_cat/indices` all returned a ClusterBlockException like `ClusterBlockException[blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/5/index read-only (api)];]`.\n\nI was able to fix the problem by unlocking the indices individually. However, there was -- to my admittedly-limited knowledge -- **no** way to list all my indices. It was only because I kept a separate list of indices that I was able to determine which indices to unlock. Conceivably, a user could get into a problematic state where they can't determine which index to unlock.\n\nMy guess is that the upgrade process attempted to upgrade the read-only indexes, which failed because they were set to read-only. Two possible solutions: one is that upgrades disregard the read-only flag; the other is that the `_aliases` etc. endpoints don't fail when some indexes are upgraded to 1.5.2 and others are still an older version.\n\nI should note that this was a one-box, one-cluster install of Elasticsearch. Both 1.3.2 and 1.5.2 were installed via the .deb. My elasticsearch.yml is quite boring (just a few special HTTP settings). \n\nThis was my production box, so I don't have it available for testing anymore. Let me know if you have questions about replicability, etc.\n","closed_by":{"login":"tlrx","id":642733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/642733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx","html_url":"https://github.com/tlrx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlrx/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
