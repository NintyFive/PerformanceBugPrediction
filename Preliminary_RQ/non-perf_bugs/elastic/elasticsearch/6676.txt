When indexing, this creates an additional field that holds the number of tokens in the text field.\nWhen a document is retrieved from the transaction log (because no flush happened yet),  and I want to get the `token_count` of my text field, I would assume that the `token_count` field is simply not retrieved, because it does not exist yet.
