I had to additionally download transport-5.0.0-rc1.jar from http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.elasticsearch.client%7Ctransport%7C5.0.0-rc1%7Cjar\n\nThe documentation on: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/5.x/transport-client.html refers to PreBuiltTransportClient to be used in the Java API, so it seems to me that this class should be provided together with the other JARs in the official download, and should not be additionally searched and downloaded from another page. This is useful for cases where plain ant is used as a build system with JARs from the local file system. \n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Elasticsearch 5.0.0-rc1 from https://www.elastic.co/downloads\n2. Include JARs from elasticsearch-5.0.0-rc1/lib/ in the CLASSPATH\n3. Try to use the PreBuiltTransportClient as documented on: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/5.x/transport-client.html\n4. The class PreBuiltTransportClient cannot be found\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n\n<!--\nIf you are filing a feature request, please remove the above bug\nreport block and provide responses for all of the below items.\n-->\n\n**Describe the feature**:\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
