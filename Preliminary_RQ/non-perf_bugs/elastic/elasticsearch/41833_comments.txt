It is true that the parsed classes don't allow to print their content out without typed keys, which is the problem you are encountering. Can't you ignore the type if it does not matter to you? The separator we use is `#`. Ideally, using low level client for this type of things is the best solution. When you use the high-level REST client you pay the price of parsing responses, which is a waste if all you need is the raw response.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/489573115","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41833#issuecomment-489573115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41833","id":489573115,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTU3MzExNQ==","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T10:20:37Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T10:20:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"the `#` character can be a bit tricky with some templating languages on the client side.\r\n\r\nThe double parsing is a good reason to stick with the low level client however.\r\n\r\nPlease close, if you think it does not make sense to invest any time in.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/489574569","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41833#issuecomment-489574569","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41833","id":489574569,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTU3NDU2OQ==","user":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T10:27:02Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T10:27:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"On one hand it could be nice to expose a way to execute high-level requests and retrieving their raw responses without paying the price of parsing responses, but when I look at the manual code required to do it, only a few lines, I think that it's easy enough to do so externally.
