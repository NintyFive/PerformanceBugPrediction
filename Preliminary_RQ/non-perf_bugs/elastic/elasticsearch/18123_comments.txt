For example, `\\n` represents a newline. However, `\\F` is not a valid escape sequence and that's why you will get a JSON parse exception. The reason that you do not get such an exception with `\\f` is due to this being a valid escape sequence representing the form-feed character.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/216663989","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18123#issuecomment-216663989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18123","id":216663989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjY2Mzk4OQ==","user":{"login":"imranazad","id":1709630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1709630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranazad","html_url":"https://github.com/imranazad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranazad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranazad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranazad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranazad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranazad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranazad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranazad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranazad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imranazad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T21:03:52Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T21:03:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you I'm aware that it's an escape sequence however how would I do an exact phrase match for the \\\"The God\\Father\\\"\" I have tried escaping the back slash with a forward slash like so \\\"The God\\/Father\\\"\" but I'm still not getting any results.
