One reason it was removed is because Aggregations have no way of leveraging range fields; so I am opening this issue to solicit ideas on adding range field support to aggregations. For relevant bucket aggregations (e.g., histogram, range, date_histogram, date_range, ip_range)  it seems the simple way is to count the document if the indexed range `INTERSECTS` with the bucket range? There are also a lot of interesting things (e.g., distribution stats) we could do for supporting range fields in existing metric aggregations (`stats`, `extended_stats`, etc). I don't want to overthink this but it seems like there are several different directions we could go here; and we had some questions around this topic at elasticon AMA, so I'd like to start gathering some thoughts.","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
