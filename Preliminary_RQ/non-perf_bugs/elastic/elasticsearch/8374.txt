https://github.com/bitemyapp/bloodhound partly because I was having a hell of a time generating valid Elasticsearch requests without lots of copy-paste and templating.\n\nThe docs have not been improved much in the last couple years other than when you did the big site change.\n\nIt's extremely hard for a new user of Elasticsearch to get a bird's eye view.\n\nI brought up Bloodhound when I first released it as a way to possibly start a proper spec of what Elasticsearch accepts as a valid request and what it does not. I'd like to revive the idea of having a spec so that users and client implementors don't have to keep rediscovering how Elasticsearch works through haphazard experimentation.\n\nBack when I was implementing Bloodhound I asked if there was a spec. I was told there wasn't one. I was briefly hopeful when I saw there was a Thrift spec...but it passes off the actual document structure as a JSON blob, lending no useful information.\n\nPlease at least consider having a spec for the API.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
