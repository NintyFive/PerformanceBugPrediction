This is bad because specifying two different values for these parameters makes elasticsearch return dates that are not in UTC. Instead we should only support a `zone` parameter that is the time zone that we will use to compute the buckets, and return buckets in UTC.\n\nSimilarly we have `pre_offset` and `post_offset` while we should only support a single `offset` parameter that would allow to do things like:\n- daily buckets should go from 6AM to 6AM the next day instead of 12AM\n- monthly buckets should go from the 10th of the month to the 10th of the next month instead of the 1st\n- etc.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cbuescher","id":10398885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzk4ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10398885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher","html_url":"https://github.com/cbuescher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbuescher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
