By setting `index.search.slowlog.reformat` to `false` it was possible to turn this feature off and log search queries as they were sent by client and essentially switch slowlog to multiline format. \r\n\r\nStarting with 5.0 the `index.search.slowlog.reformat`setting is ignored on search slowlog and we always pretty print queries, which made slowlog multi-line with no option to get back to the previous behavior. \r\n\r\nThe behavior of index slow log didn't change and I don't see anything related in breaking changes, which makes me think that this change might have been unintentional. \r\n\r\nI think we should document and restore the `index.search.slowlog.reformat` behavior or, alternatively, remove this setting since it's no longer used. I would personally prefer the former solution since dealing with multi-line logs can be quite painful.
