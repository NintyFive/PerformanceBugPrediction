I think long term we want this to be a test only setting anyway. Maybe we can get rid of it and just set both network and discovery type from the test framework as we want them…\n\n> On 26 Jan 2016, at 15:50, Luca Cavanna notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> The node.mode setting supports two values: local or networkand was introduced by #3713.

Unless I am overlooking something, we can deprecate one of the two. The boolean one seems the simpler the keep, what do people think about this?\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/175573104","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16234#issuecomment-175573104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16234","id":175573104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTU3MzEwNA==","user":{"login":"s1monw","id":973334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/973334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw","html_url":"https://github.com/s1monw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1monw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-27T11:36:05Z","updated_at":"2016-01-27T11:36:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 @javanna \n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
