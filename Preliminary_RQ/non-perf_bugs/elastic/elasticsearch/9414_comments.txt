It is worth reading this excellent blog post discussing the foibles of the query string syntax: https://lucidworks.com/blog/why-not-and-or-and-not/\n\nIn particular, note these two rules:\n- AND will change the Occurs flag of the clause to it’s left to MUST unless it has already been set to MUST_NOT\n- AND sets the Occurs flag of the clause to it’s right to MUST\n\n... and the recommendation to use parentheses rather than relying on operator precedence.\n\nYou're welcome to take this up with Lucene, where it would have to be changed in order to make it into Elasticsearch.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
