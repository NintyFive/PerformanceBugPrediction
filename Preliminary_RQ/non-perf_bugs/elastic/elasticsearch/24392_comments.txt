The behavior can be overridden with the index setting `index.recovery.initial_shards` (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/index-modules.html#index.recovery.initial_shards), but this is not advised as you're trading availability for safety. \r\nIn ES 5 we have completely reworked this part: we now uses unique shard copy ids that allow us to safely select the right shard copy as primary (for an explanation how that works in ES 5, see https://www.elastic.co/blog/tracking-in-sync-shard-copies).\r\nIn your example, note that you also did not properly set `minimum_master_nodes`, so you could also experience split brain with the configuration you gave.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
