The classes resolved just fine for me. I also checked for any differences in the pom files and only found that the only changes were version numbers.\r\n\r\nDo note: The action objects are a part of the `elasticsearch` jar, which is a dependency of the HLRC (from the pom.xml):\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>elasticsearch</artifactId>\r\n  <version>6.7.2</version>\r\n  <scope>compile</scope>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaven downloads this just fine for me as a transitive dependency. I would double check that you are able to reach the jar (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/6.7.2/) from Maven, as well as any dependency management configurations. It's possible that you might have some sort of configuration that is keeping it from pulling the artifact.\r\n\r\nSince this didn't reproduce for me, I'm going to go ahead and close this out - but if you find some additional information that might help us successfully reproduce it, please share it here and we can re-open this to get things fixed!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
