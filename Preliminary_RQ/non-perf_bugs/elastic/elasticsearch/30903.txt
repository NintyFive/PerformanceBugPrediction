On the other hand we want to make sure that the inputs are honored, so we can't  silently match the distribution for some projects (i.e. use `zip` even trough `zip-oss` is required ), we want to ave tasks skipped in these cases. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this we need a better way to express distribution requirements for cluster formation so that projects can define distribution types that they need and the plugins can do all the setup without the individual projects having to deal with setting up the tasks to do so.
