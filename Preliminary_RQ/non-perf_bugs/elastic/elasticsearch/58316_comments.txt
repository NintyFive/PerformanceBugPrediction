I know just invoking a single api, would be the easiest way to build the data stream overview, but given that computing the more expensive stats changes the runtime characteristics of the get data stream api completely, I wonder whether it would be ok if we add stats to the data stream stats api?

As long as the stats API supports wildcards, I think it's OK for the UI to make two API calls to retrieve the data it needs. We'll retrieve all data streams and stats for all data streams with two parallel API requests, and then merge this information together so we can present it in the table.\r\n\r\n> Alternatively we can add the information returned by the get data stream also to the data stream stats api, since those bits of information don't affect how data stream stats is executed, but then there is overlap between these two apis.\r\n\r\nThanks for mentioning this possibility as well. I'm comfortable with moving forward with the implementation I mentioned above, and then exploring merging data stream info into the stats API if we discover a concrete need for that level of optimization.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/658058687","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58316#issuecomment-658058687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58316","id":658058687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODA1ODY4Nw==","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-14T08:51:48Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T08:51:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Part of this has been implemented via #59128 and the other part will be implemented via #58707.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/658865742","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58316#issuecomment-658865742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/58316","id":658865742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODg2NTc0Mg==","user":{"login":"danhermann","id":22777892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzc3ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22777892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann","html_url":"https://github.com/danhermann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhermann/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-15T16:29:11Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T16:29:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Completed via #59128 and #58707.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
