The response includes a `doc` array with all the documents each element similar in structure to the `get` API. Here is an example:\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9200/_mget?pretty=1 -d '{\n    \"docs\" : [\n        {\n            \"_index\" : \"test\",\n            \"_type\" : \"type\",\n            \"_id\" : \"1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"_index\" : \"test\",\n            \"_type\" : \"type\",\n            \"_id\" : \"2\"\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nThe `mget` endpoint can also be used against an index (in which case its not required in the body):\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9200/test/_mget?pretty=1 -d '{\n    \"docs\" : [\n        {\n            \"_type\" : \"type\",\n            \"_id\" : \"1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"_type\" : \"type\",\n            \"_id\" : \"2\"\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nAnd a type:\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9200/test/type/_mget?pretty=1 -d '{\n    \"docs\" : [\n        {\n            \"_id\" : \"1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"_id\" : \"2\"\n        }\n    ]\n}'\n```\n\nIn which case, the `ids` element can directly be used to simplify the request:\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9200/test/type/_mget?pretty=1 -d '{\n    \"ids\" : [\"1\", \"2\"]\n}'\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
