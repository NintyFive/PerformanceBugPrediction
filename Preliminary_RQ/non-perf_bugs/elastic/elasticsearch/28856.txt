Start an elasticsearch process: `bin/elasticsearch`\r\n 2. Create a simple index:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PUT \"localhost:9200/stop-wildcard-test\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\r\n\t\"mappings\": {\r\n\t\t\"doc\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"properties\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"content\": { \"type\": \"text\" }\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n 4. Request validation for `\"on the run*\"`: \r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST \"localhost:9200/stop-wildcard-test/_validate/query?explain&pretty\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n      \"query_string\": {\r\n        \"query\": \"on the run*\",\r\n        \"analyzer\": \"stop\",\r\n        \"analyze_wildcard\": true\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n}'\r\n```\r\nResponse: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"valid\" : true,\r\n  \"_shards\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 1,\r\n    \"successful\" : 1,\r\n    \"failed\" : 0\r\n  },\r\n  \"explanations\" : [\r\n    {\r\n      \"index\" : \"stop-wildcard-test\",\r\n      \"valid\" : true,\r\n      \"explanation\" : \"MatchNoDocsQuery(\\\"analysis was empty for content:on\\\") content:run*\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI also tested the following queries:\r\n - `on the run` produces the expected `content:run`, without `MatchNoDocsQuery`\r\n - `on* the run` produces `MatchNoDocsQuery(\\\"analysis was empty for content:on\\\") content:run`\r\nAlso tested with wildcard analysis off:\r\n- `on the run*` produces `MatchNoDocsQuery(\\\"analysis was empty for content:on\\\") content:run*`\r\n- ` on the run` produces the expected `content:run`\r\n- `on* the run` produces `content:on* content:run` (unlike with wildcard analysis on)\r\n\r\nFor comparison, here is the response to the same query from a fresh installation of 5.5.0 (+ analysis_icu for parity, but probably not relevant here?):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"valid\": true,\r\n    \"_shards\": {\r\n        \"total\": 1,\r\n        \"successful\": 1,\r\n        \"failed\": 0\r\n    },\r\n    \"explanations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"index\": \"stop-wildcard-test\",\r\n            \"valid\": true,\r\n            \"explanation\": \"_all:run\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\r\nNot relevant.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
