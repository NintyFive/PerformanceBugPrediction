In HTML, two consecutive spaces are interpreted as a single space.  This is bad because I am trying to display sets of log lines that are to be viewed together and they are formatted in a grid.  In this text grid, multiple spaces are inserted for alignment purposes, and I need to have them preserved in the Web interface.\n\nI came up with this small change to replace each space with &nbsp;, and it seems to fix the issue for me.\n\n(I also changed the css to display the table in Monospace font, but that's another issue.)\n\n```\ndiff --git a/src/app/panels/table/module.js b/src/app/panels/table/module.js\nindex 20b0736..8a535e6 100644\n--- a/src/app/panels/table/module.js\n+++ b/src/app/panels/table/module.js\n@@ -380,7 +380,9 @@ function (angular, app, _, kbn, moment) {\n   module.filter('tableTruncate', function() {\n     return function(text,length,factor) {\n       if (!_.isUndefined(text) && !_.isNull(text) && text.toString().length > 0) {\n-        return text.length > length/factor ? text.substr(0,length/factor)+'...' : text;\n+         text = text.length > length/factor ? text.substr(0,length/factor)+'...' : text;\n+         text = text.replace(/ /g, \"&nbsp;\");\n+         return text;\n       }\n       return '';\n     };\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
