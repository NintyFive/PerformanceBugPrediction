This can be problematic if at some point you need to perform a change that requires reindexing (eg. an analyzer change) because this means that the data needs to be pulled again from another data source.\n\nInstead, we could disable some mappings options in order to make sure that we always have all the information needed to reindex (eg. with [client helpers](http://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/helpers.html#elasticsearch.helpers.reindex)). Here are the settings that we would need to enforce:\n- `_source` is enabled and stored\n- `_timestamp`, `_ttl`, `_routing`, `_parent` are stored\n\nRelates to #8870\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
