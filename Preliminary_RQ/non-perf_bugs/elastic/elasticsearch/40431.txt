Today, search dsl allows for a global preference attribute which applies against all indices in the payload. However, as single search can span across multiple indices, I wanted to introduce an optional per index setting to control search preference at individual index levels.\r\n\r\n**Feature request/proposed change summary:**\r\n1. An additional per index setting `index.search_preference` which allows for different preference modes at index level\r\n2. Is there value in making search preference pluggable which will allow easier experimentation of routing preferences?\r\n \r\n**Conflict Resolution:**\r\nIf search dsl contains a preference that conflicts with the new index setting `index.search_preference` , I feel the index setting should win, given index settings are more of an admin controlled decision based on careful shard placements\r\n \r\n**Use case/Background:**\r\nI have a hybrid cluster where some nodes are slow with spinning disks and others are ssd based fast nodes. For most indices on fast nodes, I would like to enforce `adaptive_replica_selection` or `round_robin` as `index.search_preference` but some of the indices on my cluster are on slow hardware I want to enforce `primary_first` (now deprecated) or explicit string based routing to ensure high cache/mmap hits\r\n\r\nI would love to get some feedback on this request and will also be happy to contribute a PR if this sounds useful.","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
