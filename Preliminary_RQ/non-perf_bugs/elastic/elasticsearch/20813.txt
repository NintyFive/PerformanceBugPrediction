Means match_all query is not getting executed by default. This was running fine with Elasticsearch 2.4.0 \n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n_1. Create an index and index one document with following commands_\ncurl -XPUT \"http://localhost:9200/test_index\"\n\ncurl -XPUT \"http://localhost:9200/test_index/test_type/1\" -d'\n{\"text\":\"united states\"}'\n\n_2.
