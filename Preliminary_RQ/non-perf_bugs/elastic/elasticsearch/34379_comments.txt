See related PR https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34831 for additional information (relevant text copied below):\r\n\r\n\r\n* We will not inject these metrics into the config at anytime, this introduces ambiguity and we end up returning something to the end user that is not what they provided. This could be considered unintended and damaging behavior on the end user part.\r\n* Instead, Rollup will, at document index time, store the max/min of the timestamp field in the `date_histogram` aggregation. \r\n    * If the user requests the `min/max` aggs over the `date_histo.field` then that is stored. \r\n    * Otherwise, the rollup Job will calculate the `min` `max` at index time with the data that is already gathered. This `min` `max` could be approximations based on the interval + timestamp of the bucket (which is the timestamp at the start of the bucket). \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
