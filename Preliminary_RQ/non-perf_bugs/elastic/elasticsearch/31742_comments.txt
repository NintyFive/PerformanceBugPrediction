This would play well with ILM which needs to block writes anyway for the shrink operation. It isn't perfect as it is possible to enable writing again later, but might be good enough, especially as some upcoming changes in Lucene might make it better reclaim deletes on large segments in the future.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/450920099","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31742#issuecomment-450920099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31742","id":450920099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDkyMDA5OQ==","user":{"login":"pcsanwald","id":163306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/163306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald","html_url":"https://github.com/pcsanwald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-02T16:59:27Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T16:59:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jpountz can you comment on if you think this is still a blocker for the 6.x series? it seems like either the blocker label is incorrect, or, the 6.6 label","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/450924658","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31742#issuecomment-450924658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31742","id":450924658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDkyNDY1OA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-02T17:14:50Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T17:14:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @pcsanwald, this issue is no longer relevant indeed, it was addressed via #32291.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
