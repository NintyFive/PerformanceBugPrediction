We are mostly running queries that filter to a few thousand docs and then sorting that subset. Needing to load 5 billion dates into memory for this seemingly common use case make ES feel broken. :)\n\nHeap memory management can be very painful and I think represents a difficult point for new users. Search engines are all about preprocessing data (indexing) so that querying can be fast. In my opinion doc_values accomplishes this better than the current default even if it can be slower in some cases.\n\nFWIW, doc_values is MUCH faster in our use case using 1.3.4.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
