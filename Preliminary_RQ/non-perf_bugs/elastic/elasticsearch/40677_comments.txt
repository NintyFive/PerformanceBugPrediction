The problem is that `wait_for_active_shards=1` isn't used and the call returns immediately without waiting for the follow index to be created/restored. This wasn't a problem before, because w ewere testing against node before 6.7.0 (where the `wait_for_active_shards` did not exist and we created the follow index instead of restoring for the leader index). Today we're testing against a 6.7.0 node and this now fails. I will fix this asap.\r\n\r\nNote that in 7.0.0 and higher, we're always setting `wait_for_active_shards=1`.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/478535255","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40677#issuecomment-478535255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40677","id":478535255,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODUzNTI1NQ==","user":{"login":"droberts195","id":7405510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7405510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195","html_url":"https://github.com/droberts195","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/droberts195/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-01T11:05:30Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T11:05:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for confirming that it's not a worry for releasing 6.7.1 @martijnvg!","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/478536807","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40677#issuecomment-478536807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40677","id":478536807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODUzNjgwNw==","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-01T11:11:20Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T11:11:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've opened #40681","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/478925816","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40677#issuecomment-478925816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40677","id":478925816,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODkyNTgxNg==","user":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-02T09:52:09Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T09:52:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#40681 has been merged.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
