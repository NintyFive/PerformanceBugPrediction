In general it is very low: its index options are `DOCS_ONLY` and is only enabled for fields that are indexed or have doc values. Additionally, fields that are contained in most documents will have dense postings lists that typically compress very well.\n\nI did some experiments in 2 extreme cases:\n- 5 user-defined fields in addition to the metadata fields (_uid, etc.) that are contained in every document: overhead of ~0.5 bytes per document.\n- 100 user-defined fields in the mapping and each document has 5 random fields from these 100 fields: overhead of ~4.7 bytes per document.\n\nThis looks very reasonable to me. Even the 2nd case which has very sparse documents takes less than one byte per field per document.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
