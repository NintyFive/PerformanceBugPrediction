Sadly this [is not water tight](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/resiliency/current/index.html#_the__version_field_may_not_uniquely_identify_document_content_during_a_network_partition_status_ongoing) and can go wrong if a primary fails between the read and the CAS write operation. To remedy this we need to move to using a document's `_seq_no` and `_primary_term` fields as an identifier for CAS operations.\r\n\r\nTo do so we will add two parameters to write operations - `_expected_seq_no` and `_expected_primary_term`. When set, those parameters will require the document to have exactly the expected values in the respective fields for a successful write. \r\n\r\nNote that this can co-exists with the the current `_version` based method, which we can phase out or make optional later on.\r\n\r\nRelates #10708","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
