For example \"search_quote_analyzer\" is only supported by `string` fields, `_all` cannot be a multi field, .... Also, due to the different implementations `_all` will for example  accept the following mapping:\n\n```\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"doc\": {\n      \"_all\": {\n        \"analyzer\": \"standard\",\n        \"fielddata\": {\n          \"format\": \"doc_values\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhich should actually result in `MapperParsingException[Field [text] cannot be analyzed and have doc values]`\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/131523337","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7352#issuecomment-131523337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7352","id":131523337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTUyMzMzNw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-16T10:45:35Z","updated_at":"2015-08-16T10:45:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The meta-fields have been locked down so that the configuration they expose is minimal.
