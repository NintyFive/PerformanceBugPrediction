Perform shrink operation\r\n3. Wait for allocation of any replicas on shrunk index\r\n4. As an atomic action, delete the original index and add an alias to the shrunk index for the original index name\r\n\r\nThe issue comes with step 4. IF there are search requests in flight when the original index is deleted the shard requests may get to the node that the original index was residing on and find the shard no longer exists causing a shard failure. Note that this does not mean all in flight requests will have shard failures but only those which resolved the shards of the original index but did not get received by the shard before it was deleted.\r\n\r\nI spoke with @eskibars about this and he felt that it is not a blocker for ILM but is something we should document as a limitation. We should look to solve this in a future release though","closed_by":{"login":"dakrone","id":19060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/19060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone","html_url":"https://github.com/dakrone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dakrone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
