When I run `sudo service elasticsearch start`, it starts up and runs as expected. I've set it up to start on boot by issuing `sudo update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10`. `elasticsearch` exists in both `/etc/init.d` and `/etc/rc[0-6].d`. Every time I boot my server, though, it doesn't start; I have to boot it manually. The only thing that exists in `/var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log` is this:\n\n```\n[2015-09-29 17:27:10,696][INFO ][node                     ] [Changeling] stopping ...\n[2015-09-29 17:27:10,748][INFO ][node                     ] [Changeling] stopped\n[2015-09-29 17:27:10,748][INFO ][node                     ] [Changeling] closing ...\n[2015-09-29 17:27:10,754][INFO ][node                     ] [Changeling] closed\n```\n\nWhat might be causing this?
