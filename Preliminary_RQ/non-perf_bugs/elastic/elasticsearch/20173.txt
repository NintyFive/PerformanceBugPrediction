We all know ES would love to and has aspired to introduce this feature for a long time.\n\nWith technologies like Solrcloud supporting rolling upgrades (as per https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Upgrading+a+Solr+Cluster), it is getting harder to justify using ES to back up critical search infrastructure. No question it is the preferred technology for developers, but it also needs to support the engineers that sweat day and night to keep their ES cluster's lights on.\n\nCould you share with us if the rolling upgrade feature is on the roadmap and for what release of ES it is planned for?\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
