We need to port it to maven.\n\nLooking at 0.18 branch, we need to copy over pkg: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/tree/0.18/pkg (preferable location is under src, so we have src/pkg/debian).\n\nThen, we need to translate this code to maven using the jdeb plugin: https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/0.18/build.gradle#L191. Note, we no longer have an exploded jar, so need to figure out how to copy it all to the correct locations.\n\nAnd of course, test it. And while we are at it, think of having a redhat one as well :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
