SpawnModules is a way to have modules produce sub modules. However, one way they have been used in the past is broken since we now have plugin classloader isolation. Some extension points used to allow plugging in an entire module \"implementation\". This is far too crazy for us to maintain in ES. It also leads to having lots of tiny modules that bind just a handful of classes.\n\nWe should remove this interface, and flatten the modules we have. All extension points should be class implementation based, by registering custom implementations with the module responsible for binding a given class. This has a bunch of benefits, like:\n- Making it easier to find where to add new classes to bind\n- Making it easier to document and write plugins since there will be less modules to possibly register custom extensions with\n- Reducing spaghetti dependencies because it is clear when we have _tons_ of bound classes (a lot of which can probably be removed when we can clearly see what they are instead of being spread across tons of modules)\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
