Floating points in quotes, such as \"1.0\" causes null pointer exceptions when sent as document fields. These should just be treated as a regular string. Here is the error message:\n       \"error\" : \"Index[...] Shard[1] ; nested: Failed to parse; nested: Current token (VALUE_STRING) not numeric, can not use numeric value accessors\\n at [Source: {..., \\\"f\\\": \\\"1.0\\\",...}; line: 1, column: 32]; \"\n2. Integers in status response are placed in strings. This is more an annoying detail, than a bug.\n\nI tested this with json generated in the python standard standard package, which is confirmed to be compatible with in-browser json and php json implementations. From the tracebacks I have seen, the problem is either in the JsonObectMapper or possibly the flexjson package, but I haven't looked into it in detail.\n\nLet me know if you need some more examples.\n\nThanks for the great project!\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
