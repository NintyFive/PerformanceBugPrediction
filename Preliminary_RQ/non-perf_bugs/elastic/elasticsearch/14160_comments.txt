The template, however, is basically just a string that gets parsed only when an index is created.  Currently  you can put what you like in there and the first time it will throw an exception is when you try to create an index with it. \n\nEven after #2415 is implemented, I'm not sure whether we'll store the original string or the generated JSON.  Either way your current solution will continue to work.\n\nClosing in favour of #2415\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
