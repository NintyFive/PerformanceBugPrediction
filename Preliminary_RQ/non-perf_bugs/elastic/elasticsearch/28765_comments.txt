clarify this, we publish maven artifacts for historic reasons. We have a Java client that depends on elasticsearch core / server for request and response objects and serialization. Users of these clients have all necessary plugins in maven central that are required to run these clients. Our server distribution is not in maven central, it's distributed as a zip/tar.gz/rpm etc. from our download mirrors. If there is a plugin missing please let us know. To my knowledge there is none. For `analysis-icu` there is no need to publish it since the client doesn't have a dependency on that plugin. \r\n\r\nFor instance reindex is needed to be used with the client: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/elasticsearch/plugin/reindex-client/\r\n\r\nSame is true for percolator: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/elasticsearch/plugin/percolator-client/\r\n\r\nhence they are on maven central. Other plugins that are not needed as a java-dependency are not and we don't plan to do so since it's not intended to be used outside of the elasticsearch server. We also don't support embedded server for reference please read this: https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-the-server\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies the issues here.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
