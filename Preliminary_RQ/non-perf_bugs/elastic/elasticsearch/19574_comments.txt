This will be a bit more obvious in 5.0 thanks to a large amount of work that has gone into the settings part of the code across Elasticsearch. You'll also be able to _unset_ persistent settings in 5.0.\n\n```\nuser@esclient01:~# curl -XPUT http://10.1.2.3:9200/_cluster/settings -d '{\"persistent\": {\"marvel.enabled\": false}}'\n{\"acknowledged\":true,\"persistent\":{},\"transient\":{}}\n```\n\nThis indicates the the setting was not accepted. It was acknowledged that your request was well-formed, but the persistent and transient blocks were empty because nothing you passed in was accepted. This too will improve a bit in 5.0.\n\n`marvel.enabled` is a setting that controls whether the plugin should initialize. If `false`, then it will not load them. The only way to set this usefully is within the `elasticsearch.yml` (or command line) so that it reads the value at startup.\n\nThe [setting you're looking](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/marvel/current/configuration.html#stats-export) for is `marvel.agent.interval`, which controls the polling interval from the internal agent. You want to shut this down until you decide otherwise to effectively stop Marvel:\n\n``` http\nPUT /_cluster/settings\n{\n  \"persistent\": {\n    \"marvel.agent.interval\": -1\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote the value is traditionally a time value (e.g., `\"10s\"`), but to disable it you currently set it to `-1`. In ES 5.0, this setting will change to be more obvious.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/373890910","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19574#issuecomment-373890910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19574","id":373890910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mzg5MDkxMA==","user":{"login":"debadair","id":362578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjU3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/362578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair","html_url":"https://github.com/debadair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debadair/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-17T03:27:30Z","updated_at":"2018-03-17T03:27:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No longer updating Marvel docs.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
