My mapping looks like this:\n\n```\n\"a\" : {\n              \"path\" : \"just_name\",\n              \"properties\" : {\n                \"content\" : {\n                  \"type\" : \"string\",\n                  \"analyzer\" : \"standard\",\n                  \"include_in_all\" : false\n                },\n                \"sortValue\" : {\n                  \"type\" : \"string\",\n                  \"index\" : \"not_analyzed\",\n                  \"omit_norms\" : true,\n                  \"index_options\" : \"docs\",\n                  \"include_in_all\" : false\n                }\n              }\n            },\n\"b\" : {\n              \"path\" : \"just_name\",\n              \"properties\" : {\n                \"content\" : {\n                  \"type\" : \"string\",\n                  \"analyzer\" : \"standard\",\n                  \"include_in_all\" : false\n                },\n                \"sortValue\" : {\n                  \"type\" : \"string\",\n                  \"index\" : \"not_analyzed\",\n                  \"omit_norms\" : true,\n                  \"index_options\" : \"docs\",\n                  \"include_in_all\" : false\n                }\n              }\n            }\n```\n\nNow when I get documents sorted by \"a.sortValue\" I will get results that have values from b.sortValue in the SearchHit.getSortValues(). \nSearching by a.content and b.content works just fine and only matches the content in one field as expected. Also if I remove the \"path\" : \"just_name\", the sorting is done correctly. But once I set path to just_name, it seems that sorting only cares about the last part of the path (searchValue). \n\nThis is with elasticsearch version 0.90.2\n","closed_by":{"login":"tandres19","id":2283348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODMzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2283348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandres19","html_url":"https://github.com/tandres19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandres19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandres19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandres19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandres19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandres19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandres19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandres19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandres19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandres19/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
