This specific problem seems fixable, but fixing resilience problems that only occur in one-node clusters is generally a long way down the priority list. Use >1 node where you need resilience.\r\n\r\n- Backoff of _logging_ is a bad idea - when analysing log files it's important to be able to reason about what the system was doing based on messages that aren't there as well as the ones that are, and suppressing log messages breaks that.\r\n\r\n- The [linked discuss issue](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/cannot-recover-index-because-of-missing-tanslog-files/38336) reached a workaround.\r\n\r\n- There's been no further activity here for a couple of years.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
