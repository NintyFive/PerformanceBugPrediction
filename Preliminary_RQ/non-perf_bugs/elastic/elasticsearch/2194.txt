We currently have \n- \"minimum_number_should_match\" and the api method minimumNumberShouldMatch(string) \n- \"minimum_should_match\" and the api method minimumShouldMatch(String)\n- \"minimum_match\" and the api method minimumMatch(int)\n\nyet the last one has a slightly different semantic since it is more explicit, I still want to discuss to make this consistent since they all have the same purpose and having 3 different names is confusing. I suggest do use the \"minimumShouldMatch\" version consistently and deprecate the other methods in 0.19 we certainly need support minimum_number_should_match as JSON keys for compatibility\n\ncomments welcome\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
