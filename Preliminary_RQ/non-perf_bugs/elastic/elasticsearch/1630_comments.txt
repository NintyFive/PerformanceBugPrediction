They both use the same code and error message, but each of them highlights a specific issue, one of which was a misunderstanding and invalid ( #1627 ), while the other highlights the actual issue that happened and was valid ( #1629 ). The two issues presented in these two fall into entirely different classes of importance, one of them being fixable by workaround from the outside, the other being a core issue in your infrastructure. True, i might've edited #1627 and it could've been reopened, but that would've made it more difficult for people coming later to get to and understand the meat of the issue.\n\nFurthermore: Why did you decide to close this one? It is as well a unique issue that is not a duplicate of any of the other two. No matter whether you fix the accidental masking of errors or not, the errors generated are entirely unhelpful for the a user who simply sends a query and gets that kind of error back.\n\nAre you saying you are happy with the situation of your error messages being unhelpful? Or that they are unfixable?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/3598364","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1630#issuecomment-3598364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1630","id":3598364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTgzNjQ=","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-01-21T19:22:54Z","updated_at":"2012-01-21T19:22:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All of those issues refer to the same problem, you send an illegal search structured request, and elasticsearch does not properly tell you that its a wrong structure.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/3599555","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1630#issuecomment-3599555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1630","id":3599555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTk1NTU=","user":{"login":"wchristian","id":175467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTQ2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/175467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchristian","html_url":"https://github.com/wchristian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchristian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchristian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchristian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchristian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchristian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchristian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchristian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchristian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wchristian/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-01-21T22:41:33Z","updated_at":"2012-01-21T22:41:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Oh.
