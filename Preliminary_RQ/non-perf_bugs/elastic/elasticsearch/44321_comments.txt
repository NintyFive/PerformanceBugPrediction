We still think that the CMS garbage collector is the best option for the majority of deployments at this point but we do support now G1GC as well since Elasticsearch 6.5.0 (if running on JDK 11 or better). There is currently an open PR (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/44145) which will improve our documentation here.\r\n\r\n> So I must have change config using GC or using jdk\r\n\r\nNo, that is not required. This message is informational and means that the CMS garbage collector is deprecated, i.e. it might be removed in a future JDK.\r\n\r\n> Can I Use ZGC?\r\n\r\nAt this point the only garbage collectors that are supported by Elasticsearch are CMS and G1GC. To be clear: From a purely technical perspective you can use ZGC with Elasticsearch but that's not something that we test and hence it's not a supported configuration.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/513696806","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44321#issuecomment-513696806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/44321","id":513696806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzY5NjgwNg==","user":{"login":"teahyuk","id":23113035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTEzMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/23113035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teahyuk","html_url":"https://github.com/teahyuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teahyuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teahyuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teahyuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teahyuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teahyuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teahyuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teahyuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teahyuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teahyuk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-22T08:36:19Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T08:36:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thank you","performed_via_github_app":null}]
