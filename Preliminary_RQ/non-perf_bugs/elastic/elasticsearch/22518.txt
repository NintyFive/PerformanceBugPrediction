In fact, the only place I can find mention of this is a brief mention on the (query-filter context)[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.1/query-filter-context.html] page.\r\n\r\nThat `must_not` uses a filter context can be a fairly important consideration when deciding how to structure a query, as such it should be, at a minimum, mentioned, and ideally explained in detailed.  Even something as simple as\r\n\r\n> Clauses are executed in filter context meaning that scoring is ignored and clauses are considered for caching.  Because scoring is ignored, a score of `0` for all documents is returned.\r\n\r\n**edit**: correction on what score is returned, I thought it was `1` initially as that's the score returned when just a `must_not` clause is specified.  Further testing leads me to believe that's because of an implicit `must` clause with a `match_all` query since if a `filter` clause or `must` clause with `constant_score` with `boost: 0` the score is reduced to `0`.","closed_by":{"login":"mayya-sharipova","id":5738841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5738841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova","html_url":"https://github.com/mayya-sharipova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayya-sharipova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
