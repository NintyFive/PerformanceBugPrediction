The Restore API should expose a parameter \"new_index\"  (or even \"new_type\" if type level restore is possible) which is the name of the index that use the new mapping.\n   If no \"new_index\" is specified then the fixed in #5210 should be effective.\n2. Ultimately an API that hide the complexity of same cluster restore. Hence one can change the mapping of a index on the fly with a single API call.\n3. (Related) Maybe the same can be done by \"update by query\", if there is a way to traverse the whole index/type natively and use the result to fill the new index.\n","closed_by":{"login":"javanna","id":832460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/832460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna","html_url":"https://github.com/javanna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javanna/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
