Object orientation teaches us the value of encapsulation and this enhancement allows the scripts to encapsulate the logic used in the construction of new documents as well as the current logic for modifying existing documents.\n\nThe suggested change is that a new `scripted_upsert` parameter can be passed to upsert requests to indicate if the script should be called to perform inserts. The default value is \"false\" to reflect the current behaviour. If set to \"true\" and an insert is being formed the following steps occur:\n1) The example `upsert` document passed by the client (which now could be {} ) is presented in the script context as the initial state of the document held in `ctx._source`.\n2) The `ctx.op` field in the script context is set to `create` to indicate that this is an insert as opposed to update operation\n3) The script (or stored script) used to perform updates is called with the `params` values passed from the client (in the same way updates are invoked). It mutates the map of values held in `ctx._source` appropriately.\n4) The script can set `ctx.op` to `none` if it wants to ignore the insert, otherwise the document held in `ctx._source` after the script completes is stored\n","closed_by":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
