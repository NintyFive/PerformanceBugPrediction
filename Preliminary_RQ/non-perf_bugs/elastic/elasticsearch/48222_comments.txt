There are some advantages and disadvantages to this. One advantage is that it prevents us from having to add yet another configuration file (the `system_jvm.options` that I proposed when we discussed this in person earlier this week). It also removes the temptation that the user might have to mess with these. However, removing that temptation can be seen as both a feature, and a bug in that it also makes where these options come from invisible to the user.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/543748000","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48222#issuecomment-543748000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48222","id":543748000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Mzc0ODAwMA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T13:32:01Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T13:32:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We agreed to hardcode such system options, while keeping ways to disable them if they prove problematic.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/546078692","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48222#issuecomment-546078692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48222","id":546078692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjA3ODY5Mg==","user":{"login":"pcsanwald","id":163306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/163306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald","html_url":"https://github.com/pcsanwald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcsanwald/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-24T19:59:36Z","updated_at":"2019-10-24T19:59:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I removed `discuss` label based on @jpountz summary and the subsequent PR (#48252 )","performed_via_github_app":null}]
