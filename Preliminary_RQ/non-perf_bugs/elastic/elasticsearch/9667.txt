Because the index is largish, I have replication disabled during bulk inserts. When I try and increase the replication on one of the indices, it often gets stuck with 1 or 2 unassigned shards.\n\n```\nunassigned: [11]\n\nshard allocation:\nnode0: [0,1,2,3,4,8,10,11]\nnode1: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\nnode2: [0,2,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]\nnode3: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n```\n\nI have routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node set to 9 `number_of_shards * (number_of_replicas+1) / number_of_nodes`\nI have number_of_shards arbitrarily set to 12.\n\nThe problem is that node0 has 8 shards, so it's the only node that can receive another shard, but it already has shard 11 so the final 11 shard remains unassigned indefinitely. The reason I set total_shards_per_node is because I'm trying to limit how often the cluster rebalances. I'm having stability problems anyway where a node will drop out.\n\nthanks,\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
