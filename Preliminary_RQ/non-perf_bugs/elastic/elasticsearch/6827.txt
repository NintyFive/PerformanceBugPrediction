While the nulls occurred as expected at the start of the result set, as soon as a real result was found, any subsequent results that should have contained null, now held the last good result, and weirder still, as a string (all good results were ints).\n\nOnce I realised what was happening I added a guard clause to my script solving the issue for me.\n\n``` mvel\nif (set.size() < 1) {\n  return null;\n}\n```\n\nMy assumption is that the out of bounds array access failed silently and somehow the last known good result got leaked into the current hit. In the event that failing silently is intentional behaviour, the value certainly shouldn't leak.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
