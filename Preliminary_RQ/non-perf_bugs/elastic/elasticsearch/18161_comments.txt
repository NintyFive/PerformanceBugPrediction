You don't mention how many processors you have, but just unsetting this setting will give you the default. With a high size, if search is struggling for whatever reason, then it'll just use one of the many threads that you have allowed it to use which will bring a system to its knees.  Instead, with a reasonable thread pool size, search requests will be queued or rejected, keeping the system healthy.\n\nThat's why I want to see what happens to memory usage when the threads setting is the default.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/217643788","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18161#issuecomment-217643788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18161","id":217643788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzY0Mzc4OA==","user":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-07T15:20:39Z","updated_at":"2016-05-07T15:20:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Everything you are describing is a side effect of having too many threads \\* segments per node.
