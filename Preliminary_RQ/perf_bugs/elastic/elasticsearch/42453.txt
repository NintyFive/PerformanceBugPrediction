Many of these tend to do with timeouts... of course.\r\n\r\nThe other issue here is that these tests are just horribly slow. They actually account for the bulk of one of our pull request checks.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4106672/58268788-f431f280-7d3a-11e9-880c-b854ff583101.png)\r\n\r\nThis simply should not be the case as most PRs never change this stuff and most developers could care less about the result of these tests. We need to reevaluate what these tests are doing to see a) what is making them so damn slow and b) are they even providing any reasonable benefit. One thing we might consider is ripping testing of this project completely out of the general developer workflow and creating a parallel Jenkins build specifically for this stuff that triggers only on VCS changes to `buildSrc/`.","closed_by":{"login":"alpar-t","id":2565652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2565652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t","html_url":"https://github.com/alpar-t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpar-t/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
