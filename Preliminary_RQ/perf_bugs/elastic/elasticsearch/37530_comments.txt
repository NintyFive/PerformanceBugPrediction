For the performance regression there, the improvements I have made in #37590 and #37597 take the performance penalty on my machine from 40x to 10x. The remaining time is spent in de-duplicating the warning headers and then what remains in encoding and formatting the log message. I don't see any room for improvement on the latter, and the de-duplication is around 50% of the remaining time. I would consider the encoding/formatting the tax we have to pay for deprecation logging something, but there is still room for improvement in the de-duplication.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/462758384","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37530#issuecomment-462758384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37530","id":462758384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Mjc1ODM4NA==","user":{"login":"ebadyano","id":26631211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjMxMjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26631211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano","html_url":"https://github.com/ebadyano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-12T13:27:13Z","updated_at":"2019-02-12T13:27:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The original performance gap from #37411 for geonames benchmark was ~21%, with above fixes from Jason I see the gap narrowed to ~7%.
