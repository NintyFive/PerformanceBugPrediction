Same conclusion as yours: 7.3 is faster!\r\n\r\nI looked at the differences between your test and ours and noticed that our query for 7.3 is slightly different: it makes use of `fixed_interval` instead of `interval`. I missed that point earlier - sorry about that. To make it clear, the query for 7.3 looked as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"aggs\": {\r\n    \"2\": {\r\n      \"date_histogram\": {\r\n        \"field\": \"@timestamp\",\r\n        \"fixed_interval\": \"1d\",\r\n        \"min_doc_count\": 1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"match_all\": {}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make sure this had an impact, I quickly made the following tests through Kibana's dev console targetting two different test clusters running respectively 6.8.2 and 7.3.0. The timings were:\r\n\r\n```\r\nquery type           6.8.2    7.3.0\r\n-------------------------------------\r\ninterval               3873    4030\r\nfixed_interval          n/a   17845\r\ncalendar_interval       n/a    4089\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe most important thing here is not the difference between 6.8 and 7.3 as I executed the queries only a couple of times manually and took only the best result. \r\nHowever, using `fixed_interval_ instead of `interval` (which is now deprecated) makes a **huge** difference!\r\n\r\nI made the test with the 4 datasets (gaussian and uniform distributions). I got the same ranking as in my forum post: _gaussian_ is faster, followed by _uniform-sameday_, _1s_ and _10s_.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't believe anymore that the date distribution in the dataset is the issue (although it has obviously some impact on the performance). `fixed_interval` is definitely where to look at...\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry I missed that initially. I pushed you in the wrong direction with an incomplete and inaccurate report. Sorry about that...\r\n\r\nFor your information, Kibana is using a `fixed_interval` in its aggregation query when it builds the histogram... That's how we noticed the slow down initially...\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/530489592","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45702#issuecomment-530489592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45702","id":530489592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDQ4OTU5Mg==","user":{"login":"polyfractal","id":1224228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1224228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal","html_url":"https://github.com/polyfractal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polyfractal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-11T17:46:09Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T17:46:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hm interesting, the fixed/calendar interval change _theoretically_ should have been equivalent to the now-deprecated `interval` (it's using the same parsing as before, just more explicit).

I think that explains why you have different behavior depending on the distribution of dates that you have in the testing shard. It shouldn't be too hard to restore the 6x behavior though. Instead of handling only utc we could check that the time zone is fixed and apply something like:\r\n`````\r\n// Create the fixed offset\r\nlong fixedOffset = timeZone.getRules().isFixedOffset() ? timeZone.getRules().getOffset(Instant.EPOCH).getTotalSeconds() * 1000 : -1;\r\n\r\n       @Override\r\n        public long round(final long utcMillis) {\r\n            if (fixedOffset != -1) {\r\n                long localMillis = utcMillis + fixedOffset;\r\n                return (roundKey(localMillis, interval) * interval) - fixedOffset;\r\n            }\r\n`````\r\nThis should handle the case where a non-fixed timezone is rewritten into a fixed timezone ?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/530776540","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45702#issuecomment-530776540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45702","id":530776540,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDc3NjU0MA==","user":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T11:06:18Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T11:06:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I also wonder if we should apply the same logic to the calendar interval since only UTC timezone is optimized there so the same slowdown would happen with fixed time zones.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/530802210","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45702#issuecomment-530802210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45702","id":530802210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDgwMjIxMA==","user":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T12:29:08Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T12:29:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jimczi after a quick look through the code that sounds good to me","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/531987952","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45702#issuecomment-531987952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/45702","id":531987952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTk4Nzk1Mg==","user":{"login":"csoulios","id":1561376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1561376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csoulios","html_url":"https://github.com/csoulios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csoulios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csoulios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csoulios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csoulios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csoulios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csoulios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csoulios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csoulios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csoulios/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-16T22:50:16Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T22:50:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@brenuart and @vboulaye thank you for reporting this issue.
