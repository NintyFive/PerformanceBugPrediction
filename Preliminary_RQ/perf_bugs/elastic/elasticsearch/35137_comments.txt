It hits the 25s timeout sometime with more than 300 lines of this log file.\r\n\r\nFollowing the improvements it works for the first 3400 lines, but not for 3500 (i.e. hitting the default 25s timeout somewhere between 3400 and 3500 lines).  This still isn't great but is a useful improvement, especially as the default `lines_to_sample` is 1000, so now it works with the default settings.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
