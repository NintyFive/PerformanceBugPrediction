I expect that the query parsing for this query is going to improve when #32039 (bkd shape improvements) and #25445 (pre-selecting geo_shape candidate matches) have been implemented. So I'm closing this issue in favor of these issues. \r\n\r\nIf possible the `geo_polygon` query should be used, because the query parsing of that query is much  lighter than what `geo_shape` query is doing.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
