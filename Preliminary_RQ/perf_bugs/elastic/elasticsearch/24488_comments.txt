Also, without any code this is next to impossible to reproduce and it is also not clear whether the problem is in your code or in Elasticsearch. \r\n\r\nCan you come up with a small self-contained (code) example and create a topic in the [Elasticsearch forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) instead? Then it will be easier to help you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
