We set up a five node elastic search cluster. Among them two indexing nodes and three query nodes. In the indexing node, we have redis, logstash and elasticsearch on both two servers. The elasticsearch uses NFS storage as data store. Our requirement is to index 300 log entries/second. But the best performance I can get from elasticsearch is only 25 log entries/second!\nHere's the detailed information in StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34449405/bad-indexing-performance-of-elasticsearch\n\nMy question is:\nCan anyone tell me what is elastic search doing and why the indexing is so slow? And is it possible to improve it?\n","closed_by":{"login":"spinscale","id":667544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/667544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale","html_url":"https://github.com/spinscale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spinscale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
