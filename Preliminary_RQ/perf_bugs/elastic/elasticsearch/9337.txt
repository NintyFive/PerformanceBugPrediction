I made lot of tests, changing for oracle JVM, changing for G1GC, but nothing worked.\n\nSi i begun to check the hot threads API and saw percolator were using large amount of CPU.\n\nJust desactivated the percolator query (with 4 percolator query in index), and here is the result : \n![screenshot012](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1506320/5780568/d95b1d60-9dab-11e4-9f9e-9b8efbe0a248.png)\n\nSince i desactivated client.percolate in node.js code, CPU are low used.\n\nDoes anyone know why percolator query is killing GC performances ?\n\nThanks a lot for your help !\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
