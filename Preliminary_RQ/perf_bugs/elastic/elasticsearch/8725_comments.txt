If so, the primary/replicas of each shard have diverged from each other, and the old shards on the recovering node probably have very few segments in common with the copies on other nodes.\n\nThis means it needs to copy pretty much all segments from scratch.  Issue #6069 is indeed (at least part of) the solution for this. Also see https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/7288\n\nI think this issue is a duplicate of the ones already mentioned and can be closed?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/65109314","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8725#issuecomment-65109314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8725","id":65109314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MTA5MzE0","user":{"login":"bobrik","id":89186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/89186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobrik","html_url":"https://github.com/bobrik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobrik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobrik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobrik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobrik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobrik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobrik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobrik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobrik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobrik/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-01T18:18:34Z","updated_at":"2014-12-01T18:18:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"99% of indices are cold and optimized to 2 segments.
