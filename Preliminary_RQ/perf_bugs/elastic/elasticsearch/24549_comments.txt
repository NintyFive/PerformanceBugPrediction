Quite a lot happens between the log line in the discovery module (which doesn't do much at that stage) and the initialized message, so this can be many things. I would recommend turning on debug logging to get more information. Also, as we will be happy to help you debug further on our forums at discuss.elastic.co . Once, and if, we resolve it to a concrete issue with some component we can open a github ticket for that. I will be closing this ticket for now.

To debug this, you need to take a stack dump (use `jstack`) when the node is hung between those two long lines. Grab a few to make sure the node is stuck doing the same thing.
