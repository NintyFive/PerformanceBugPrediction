there ,\n i have been writing about this issue in the elastic search google groups , but unfortunately no one address the issue.\nSo i am creating the Ticket here .\nProblem : \nSetup  4 core cpu with 24gb of ram .\nIndex size is 10gb , Using ES latest version \nNow when i have no where clause in the query its gives results in no time say 20 ms. but when i added BoundingBox filter its started giving result in > 200 ms .\nPlease correct me if i am wrong , i have used the same example you guys have mentioned in the Elastic Search (GeoBoundingBoxTests.java).\nDo i have to do something else or is this the limitation of ES.\nRegards\nPrashant
