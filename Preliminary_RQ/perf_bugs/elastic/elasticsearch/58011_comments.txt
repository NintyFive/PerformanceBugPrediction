The root cause of the related issue is that the setting `cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries` was set too high. We agreed to introduce a limit for that setting. We also agreed to support concurrency in phase 2 of peer recoveries but disable it by default. I will close this issue and continue working on the [PR](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/58018).","performed_via_github_app":null}]
