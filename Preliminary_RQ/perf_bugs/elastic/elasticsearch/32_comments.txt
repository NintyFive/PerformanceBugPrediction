I have just pushed a fix.\n\nThe problem you have is the fact that when you sort on string types, you must have them not analyzed (in the type mapping). Lucene might still perform the sort when they are analyzed, but it will throw a runtime exception when it can't (and this is what happens on some of the shards).\n\nAs a side note, I am going to spend time the next days to return proper failure messages from all operations, and not just counters on shards that failed.\n\nIf you can verify on your end that it is solved, I can close this issue.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/148757","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32#issuecomment-148757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/32","id":148757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODc1Nw==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-03-02T17:30:45Z","updated_at":"2010-03-02T17:30:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed ++\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
