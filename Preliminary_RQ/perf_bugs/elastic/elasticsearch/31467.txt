It seems to be closed automatically. But i can not find a practical solution to achieve it.\r\n    Finally I found that If the es / lucene support the [field /field family segment ](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/31464) , we can achieve the partial update much more easily. We make the hot-update-field to a isolate field family. if the relative fields are update, the hot-update-field will be re-built for reverse index or doc values, but the non-update fields won't be changed, so that we can save more cpu to achieve much better index throughput.\r\n    \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
