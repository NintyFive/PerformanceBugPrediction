But I guess evaluating this might get tricky because you need to benchmark a scenario which produces enough audit log entries (or even better: a varying degree of audit log entries across different scenario so you can better estimate the overhead). I think it would make sense to benchmark on one platform first and then expand as needed.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/430270134","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34321#issuecomment-430270134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/34321","id":430270134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDI3MDEzNA==","user":{"login":"jaymode","id":4339958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzk5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4339958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode","html_url":"https://github.com/jaymode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaymode/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-16T14:55:33Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T14:55:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@albertzaharovits @bizybot the default for the RollingFile appender has immediateFlush set to true according to https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders.html.
