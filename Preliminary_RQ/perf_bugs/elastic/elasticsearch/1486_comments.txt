The code is called \"LSP\" hosted here http://code.google.com/p/lucene-spatial-playground/ and I am aiming to pitch it as the replacement for Lucene's defunct spatial module.  For filtering alone (no geo sort / relevancy), there is no RAM requirement.  Polygon support is implemented via JTS, and a variable number of shapes of any kind is supported.  Shapes with area are also supported for indexing.  It'll probably be another month or so of me adding tests and plugging a few holes here and there before I'll pitch it for Lucene's spatial replacement.  That may be a good time for ElasticSearch to consider it.  It's using Lucene 4/trunk, not 3x, though.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/3353635","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1486#issuecomment-3353635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1486","id":3353635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTM2MzU=","user":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-01-04T11:57:13Z","updated_at":"2012-01-04T11:57:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dsmiley looks interesting!, would love to integrate it with elasticsearch once its done and Lucene 4.0 is released :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/7014012","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1486#issuecomment-7014012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1486","id":7014012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMTQwMTI=","user":{"login":"apatrida","id":182340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/182340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida","html_url":"https://github.com/apatrida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apatrida/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-07-16T18:08:36Z","updated_at":"2012-07-16T18:08:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is this still in the \"waiting to use\" stage?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/14283962","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1486#issuecomment-14283962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1486","id":14283962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjgzOTYy","user":{"login":"nwohaibi","id":1510290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1510290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwohaibi","html_url":"https://github.com/nwohaibi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwohaibi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwohaibi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwohaibi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwohaibi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwohaibi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwohaibi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwohaibi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwohaibi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwohaibi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-01T11:14:49Z","updated_at":"2013-03-01T11:14:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@geodawg, great testing, you spared me a lot of time trying to accomplish the same thing.\nI just want to know if you had run the same testing after ES implemented Spatial4j?
