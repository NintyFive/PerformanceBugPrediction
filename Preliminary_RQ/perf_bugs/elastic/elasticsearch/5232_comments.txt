We ran 100s nodes test (with not data in the one I refer to, just to see how quickly a cluster is formed) and the results were very good (less than 30s to form 100s nodes clusters).\n\nEven with improve_zen, the logic is still similar though, when a node joins, a full cluster state cycle is needed (more lightweight, batched, but still). Maybe the 30s come from the publish timeout, thats the one that can explain it, but I then don't understand why one of the nodes that are part of the cluster not answering in the proper time. Maybe next time you can set `discovery.zen.publish` logging to `DEBUG`, and see if we see messages like \"timed out waiting for all nodes to process published\".\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68253597","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5232#issuecomment-68253597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5232","id":68253597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjUzNTk3","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-29T12:30:09Z","updated_at":"2014-12-29T12:30:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@miccon @avleen just pinging to hear about your experiences with cluster startup on v1.4.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/68269215","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5232#issuecomment-68269215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/5232","id":68269215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjY5MjE1","user":{"login":"bluelu","id":339893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/339893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu","html_url":"https://github.com/bluelu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluelu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-29T15:58:29Z","updated_at":"2014-12-29T15:58:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm working together with @miccon.
