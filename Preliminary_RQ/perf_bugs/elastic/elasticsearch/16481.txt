currently migrating from Elasticsearch 1.7 to 2.2 and I have a performance issue with the geo_distance query.\n\nMy model is simple:\n- 20k documents in a type\n- each document contains a field with type \"array of object\" (nested mapping)\n- these nested documents contains a \"location\" field (lat/lon)\n\nI want to filter my root documents by distance.\n\nMy search queries:\n\nElasticsearch 1.7:\n\n``` json\n{\n \"filter\": {\n   \"geo_distance\": {\n     \"distance\": \"100000m\",\n     \"stores.location\": {\n       \"lat\": 48.86,\n       \"lon\": 2.35\n     }\n   }\n }\n}\n```\n\nElasticsearch 2.2:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"geo_distance\": {\n          \"distance\": \"100000m\",\n          \"stores.location\":

2.2, the response time is around 3700ms.\n\nIf I test with random locations, the response time of Elasticsearch 1.7 stay stable.
