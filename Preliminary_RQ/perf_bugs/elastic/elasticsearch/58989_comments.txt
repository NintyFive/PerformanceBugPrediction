At this time, we cannot recommend use of ZGC with Elasticsearch, because we have not evaluated and tested it thoroughly enough to make that recommendation. While Elasticsearch may run with ZGC, you may run into unexpected behavior, performance issues, or bugs that are specific to ZGC.\r\n\r\nIf and when we've determined that Elasticsearch is stable with ZGC, or any other new GC algorithm, we'll make a formal announcement of that fact. To prevent confusion, I'm going to close this issue.\r\n\r\nIf you want to discuss alternative GC strategies, there's an active community in the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/) that I highly recommend - it is frequented by many Elastic Stack power users and developers.
