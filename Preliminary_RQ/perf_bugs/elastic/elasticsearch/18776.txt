Creating index with some preset mapping on this cluster is painfully slow( about 1 minute to create a index with 1 replication). There is sufficient  memory , java heap , cpu and disk when creating index. I use hot_threads api and find that 95% period of time is spended on running the following code on master node:\n\n```\n    at com.google.common.collect.Iterators$3.hasNext(Iterators.java:164)\n    at org.elasticsearch.indices.cluster.IndicesClusterStateService.applyDeletedShards(IndicesClusterStateService.java:256)\n    at org.elasticsearch.indices.cluster.IndicesClusterStateService.clusterChanged(IndicesClusterStateService.java:167)\n    - locked <0x00000000f96ea8b0> (a java.lang.Object)\n    at org.elasticsearch.cluster.service.InternalClusterService.runTasksForExecutor(InternalClusterService.java:610)\n    at org.elasticsearch.cluster.service.InternalClusterService$UpdateTask.run(InternalClusterService.java:772)\n    at org.elasticsearch.common.util.concurrent.PrioritizedEsThreadPoolExecutor$TieBreakingPrioritizedRunnable.runAndClean(PrioritizedEsThreadPoolExecutor.java:231)\n    at org.elasticsearch.common.util.concurrent.PrioritizedEsThreadPoolExecutor$TieBreakingPrioritizedRunnable.run(PrioritizedEsThreadPoolExecutor.java:194)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n```\n\nis this a bug?
