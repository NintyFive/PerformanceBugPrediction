Even if developers are aware of the poor performance they may not have a single loop (like in bulk indexing) where it is convenient to add the required trimming of log calls.\r\nIf the DeprecationLogger implementation was made more efficient this would help with all these concerns.","closed_by":{"login":"ebadyano","id":26631211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjMxMjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26631211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano","html_url":"https://github.com/ebadyano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebadyano/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
