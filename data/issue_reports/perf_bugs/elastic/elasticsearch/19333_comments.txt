Removing a node because of slow disk I/O is quite an aggressive decision to make.  I would be hesitant to have Elasticsearch make this decision.  eg you remove one node, so the other nodes have to do shard recovery.  now they're slow too, so we remove another node, etc.\n\nInstead, we could log warnings about things like slow disk I/O and a monitoring system could pick up on these warnings and alert the sysadmin.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/233132421","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19333#issuecomment-233132421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/19333","id":233132421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzEzMjQyMQ==","user":{"login":"andrestc","id":2944739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDQ3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2944739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrestc","html_url":"https://github.com/andrestc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrestc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrestc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrestc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrestc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrestc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrestc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrestc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrestc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrestc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-16T14:17:59Z","updated_at":"2016-07-16T14:17:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @clintongormley, I think we could expose the i/o wait % on the node stats api.
