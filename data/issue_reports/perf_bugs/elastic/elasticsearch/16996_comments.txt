Perhaps you need to look for a faster JSON library, or try out the CBOR encoding instead.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/193778101","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16996#issuecomment-193778101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16996","id":193778101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Mzc3ODEwMQ==","user":{"login":"gjcampbell","id":533893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/533893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjcampbell","html_url":"https://github.com/gjcampbell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjcampbell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjcampbell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjcampbell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjcampbell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjcampbell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjcampbell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjcampbell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjcampbell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjcampbell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-08T13:05:41Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T13:05:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Search_after does look useful.
