The index template is configured for 5 shards and 1 replica and each shard contains about 20GB of logs per day. It all works great until the clock ticks over to the next day. The new index is dynamically created however at least one of the primary shards is stuck initiallising and doesn't recovery. At this point I have to stop the logs coming in. Delete the index and start the logs again.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nCheers,\n\nMarty\n","closed_by":{"login":"robertsmarty","id":4920375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjAzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4920375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty","html_url":"https://github.com/robertsmarty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertsmarty/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
