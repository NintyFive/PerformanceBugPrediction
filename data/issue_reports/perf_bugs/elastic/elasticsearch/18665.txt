The best place\nto ask a general question is at the Elastic Discourse forums at\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co. If you are in fact posting a bug report or\na feature request, please include one and only one of the below blocks\nin your new issue.\n-->\n\n<!--\nIf you are filing a bug report, please remove the below feature\nrequest block and provide responses for all of the below items.\n-->\n\n**Elasticsearch version**: 2.1.1\n\n**JVM version**: 1.8.0_72\n\n**OS version**: Windows 10\n\n**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:\nI indexed around 40K documents in a single shard, zero replica index with `_source` enabled. Each document has around 40 to 50 fields. There is only one mapping that I'm using for all documents. It has around 500 fields. I execute a `multi_match` query that matches only 38 documents and mostly the same field. The effective number of fields that get searched on through this `multi_match` query is around 400. This is the same setup I used for both Elasticsearch 1.7.1 and Elasticsearch 2.1.1 and below are the average search times under different scenarios:\n\n```\n                                | Elasticsearch 1.7.1 | Elasticsearch 2.1.1\n============================================================================\nNo highlighter                  |               40 ms |               35 ms\nPlain highlighter               |              140 ms |             1000 ms\nPostings highlighter            |               80 ms |             3000 ms\n```\n\nThe timings in the table above are fairly consistent even when the same queries are fired back to back multiple times. As you can see, if I disable highlighting all together, they both perform equally well but `postings` highlighter performs significantly worse in the new version. Interestingly, `plain` highlighter performs better than `postings` highlighter in ES 2.1.1. I also tried Elasticsearch 2.3.3 but had similar experience as Elasticsearch 2.1.1. This is a major blocker for us to move to Elasticsearch 2.x.\n\nIs this a know issue? Let me know if you need more information and I'd be happy to help.\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
