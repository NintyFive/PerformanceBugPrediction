This would be awesome, I agree. \n\nThe reason I said it is different is that it seems to me that gustavobmaia (author of the issue) run into problems becomes of faceting fields with many different values for which the current facets are not designed. \n\nBut, splitting hairs is not important :) - do you have an ETA for that alternative storage or a branch I can pull the code from? It is really an urgent problem for us which I much rather solve with something that will eventually become standard ES code. Right now I'm gearing up to develop a patch (pull request promised when I'm done).\n\nThanks,\nBoaz\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/11221640","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2468#issuecomment-11221640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/2468","id":11221640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjIxNjQw","user":{"login":"drewr","id":6202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewr","html_url":"https://github.com/drewr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-10T22:32:59Z","updated_at":"2012-12-10T22:32:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I see the confusion.
