A cluster state update task is submitted to the nodes in the cluster. When that cluster state update task arrives, each node must process the new routing table to see if they need to remove indices, delete shards, start shards, etc. Currently, applying deleted shards is O(number of indices \\* number of shards). I opened #18788 to address this.\n\nHowever, you're still going to be hurting here. Having 10000 indices on two nodes with one replica is asking for pain. This means that you have at a minimum 10000 shards on each node if you have one shard per index, and maybe 50000 shards on each node if you're using the default number of shards per index. Either way, this is way too many shards. So #18788 is not meant to address your issue directly, just improve performance for the general case. You'll still need to do something about how many indices and shards that you have.\n\n> Can I avoid this by setting any configuration? \n\nNo.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/252394235","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18776#issuecomment-252394235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/18776","id":252394235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjM5NDIzNQ==","user":{"login":"jilen","id":546573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjU3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/546573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jilen","html_url":"https://github.com/jilen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jilen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jilen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jilen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jilen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jilen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jilen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jilen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jilen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jilen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-08T01:33:15Z","updated_at":"2016-10-08T01:33:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jasontedor   I suffered from this.
