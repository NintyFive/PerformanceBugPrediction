We tried a few strategies, including:\r\n* stop writes to the cluster before restart\r\n* synced flush\r\n* setting shard allocation to \"primaries\"\r\n* [increasing delayed allocation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/delayed-allocation.html)\r\n\r\nWe can see during recovery that all shards that were on the restarted node are restored from an active replica, causing a large amount of network traffic which is throttled and taking time. With our 2 main elasticsearch clusters being 24 and 31 nodes respectively, a full cluster restart takes ~24h.\r\n\r\nWith writes disabled and synced flush, I would expect the shards to be recovered from disk on the restarted node.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**:\r\n 1. disable writes to the cluster\r\n 2. synced flush\r\n 3. set shard allocation to primaries\r\n 4. restart a node\r\n 5. set shard allocation to all\r\n 6. wait\r\n\r\nI'm at a loss as to which info might make sense to include here, but I'm more than happy to send anything that might be useful.","closed_by":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
