decompress is low down the list of hotspots but the new ExitableDirectoryReader ([introduced to give more reliable timeouts](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/52822)) appears a couple of times in the hotspot list. If this was indeed a hotspot I'd expect to see this regression in other benchmarks than the range query - have you seen this, @danielmitterdorfer  ?\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/598818610","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53498#issuecomment-598818610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53498","id":598818610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODgxODYxMA==","user":{"login":"markharwood","id":170925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/170925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood","html_url":"https://github.com/markharwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markharwood/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-13T16:54:11Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T16:54:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I expect this can close in favour of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/53496","performed_via_github_app":null}]
