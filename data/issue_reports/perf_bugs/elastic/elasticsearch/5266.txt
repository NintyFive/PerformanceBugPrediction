Using the plugins to monitor the cache I see it load properly and at that point I can run searches normally and they return fine. After about 10-15 minutes of inactivity I see it drop about 75%, and then after another few minutes, the cache is fully emptied. We get a low number of searches but the majority time out as the cache has emptied by the time it goes to do the next search. \n\nI'm currently running elasticsearch a single dedicated AWS 35GB memory instance with 50% of the memory dedicated to elasticsearch and with ulimit -l unlimited set and working. I realize I should be running multiple machines but it's not really a possibility at this point. We've got around 100,000,000 documents total which from what i've seen, isn't really considered that much for elasticsearch. I think this may be an implementation level issue but wanted to get opinions first.\n\nThe query being run is as follows:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"filtered\": {\n            \"filter\": {\n                \"and\": [\n                    {\n                        \"or\": [\n                            {\n                                \"query\": {\n                                    \"query_string\": {\n                                        \"query\": \"kittens\",\n                                        \"default_operator\": \"OR\"\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            },\n                            {\n                                \"has_child\": {\n                                    \"type\": \"dot\",\n                                    \"query\": {\n                                        \"query_string\": {\n                                            \"query\": \"kittens\",\n                                            \"default_operator\": \"OR\"\n                                        }\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            }\n                        ]\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"bool\": {\n                            \"must\": [\n                                {\n                                    \"terms\": {\n                                        \"entity_type\": [\n                                            \"user\",\n                                            \"site\"\n                                        ]\n                                    }\n                                },\n                                {\n                                    \"or\": [\n                                        {\n                                            \"exists\": {\n                                                \"field\": \"caption\"\n                                            }\n                                        },\n                                        {\n                                            \"not\": {\n                                                \"term\": {\n                                                    \"dots_count\": 0\n                                                }\n                                            }\n                                        }\n                                    ]\n                                }\n                            ],\n                            \"must_not\": [\n                                {\n                                    \"term\": {\n                                        \"restricted\": true\n                                    }\n                                },\n                                {\n                                    \"range\": {\n                                        \"publish_at\": {\n                                            \"gte\": \"2014-02-26T19:04:51+00:00\"\n                                        }\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            ]\n                        }\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"sort\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"desc\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
