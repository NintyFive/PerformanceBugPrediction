These settings are per index so if you want to update the settings for all indices you can just do:\r\n\r\n````\r\nPUT _settings\r\n{\r\n    \"index.search.slowlog.level\" : \"debug\"\r\n    \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.debug\" : \"30s\",\r\n    \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.debug\" : \"15s\"\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n> If using the following cluster level settings settings in elasticsearch.yml, nodes must be restarted:\r\n\r\nThese settings are at the index level and since 5.x you cannot set index level settings in elasticsearch.yml. \r\nSo the best way to define values for all indices is to create a default template that contains these settings. Then when you want to update the values, you can update the settings for all indices and change your default template ? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/276929550","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22905#issuecomment-276929550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/22905","id":276929550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjkyOTU1MA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T11:09:07Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T11:09:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed - we don't want to make these settings cluster level","performed_via_github_app":null}]
