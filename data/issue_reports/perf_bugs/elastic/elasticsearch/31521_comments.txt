Unfortunately, with indexing it's not that simple.  The main issue here is that indexing slow log can be reached in several different ways - original indexing on primary, as a result of replication and as a result of the recovering from the translog. And because indexing doesn't use a context object, it requires a significant plumbing effort to get id delivered to the slow log and preserved during replication and translog recovery. Since the original issue was about search, I am unsure if implementing something like this would for indexing slow log would be worth the effort.
