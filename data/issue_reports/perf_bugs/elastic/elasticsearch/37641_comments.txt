Furthermore the `query_and_fetch` execution is now reserved to queries that target a single shard. \r\nSince we reserve github for confirmed bugs and feature requests I am going to close this issue, however if you want more informations regarding the execution of the search phases you can post in the [discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch) where me or someone from the community will be glad to help.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
