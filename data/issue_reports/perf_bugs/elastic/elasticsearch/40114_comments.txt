When you send a `HEAD` request for `curl` via `-X HEAD` curl sends the `HEAD` method, but it acts like a `GET` so it sits there waiting for `Content-Length` bytes to arrive`. Since the server saw a `HEAD` request though, it would never send these bytes and `curl` will hang indefinitely waiting for them. As you've discovered, the correct way to send a `HEAD` request via `curl` is with `-I` or `--head`.\r\n\r\nThat said, there is a bug in our docs here which is that copy-as-curl functionality should treat `HEAD` specially, like `curl` needs it to be. I have opened elastic/docs#731. Since there is nothing actionable on this repository that can be taken, I will close this issue. If you want to track progress of us fixing our docs, you can do so on elastic/docs#731. We will have the fix deployed soon.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/473533595","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40114#issuecomment-473533595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40114","id":473533595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzUzMzU5NQ==","user":{"login":"elasticmachine","id":15837671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3Njcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15837671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine","html_url":"https://github.com/elasticmachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elasticmachine/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-16T14:10:13Z","updated_at":"2019-03-16T14:10:13Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Pinging @elastic/es-docs","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/473593912","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40114#issuecomment-473593912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/40114","id":473593912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzU5MzkxMg==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-16T21:23:42Z","updated_at":"2019-03-16T21:23:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, note the warning here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: Setting custom HTTP method to HEAD with -X/--request may not work the \r\nWarning: way you want.
