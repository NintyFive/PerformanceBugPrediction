You saw this logged repeatedly which tells us that it was indeed not stuck.\r\n\r\n> This node should be removed from the cluster, so that it joins back again.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the node _is_ removed from the cluster so that the new node can join in its place, as soon as the master is not busy with other higher-priority work, so I think the explanation is that your cluster was otherwise overloaded. There have been a number of changes since 7.1 that might affect this (e.g https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/43381, https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/44433, possibly others). Can you reproduce this on the latest version (7.7.0 at time of writing)? Can you share the output of `GET /_cluster/pending_tasks` from the time when it appeared to be stuck?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/631325260","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56979#issuecomment-631325260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/56979","id":631325260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMTMyNTI2MA==","user":{"login":"shwetathareja","id":2943091,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDMwOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2943091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwetathareja","html_url":"https://github.com/shwetathareja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwetathareja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwetathareja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwetathareja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwetathareja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwetathareja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwetathareja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwetathareja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwetathareja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwetathareja/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-20T08:31:25Z","updated_at":"2020-05-20T08:31:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@DaveCTurner: Thanks for the feedback.
