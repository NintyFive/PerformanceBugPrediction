As you say, after the first request (or second request, depending on how many shards you have) the stored fields will be in the file system cache and should be fast to access. The fact that you're seeing such variability points to either (a) issues with GC or (b) hardware issues, where something else is interfering with the request.\n\nEither way, this doesn't sound like a bug in Elasticsearch.  The better forum to talk about issues like this is http://discuss.elastic.co/ - there you'll find people who have had to deal with similar problems.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/205520151","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17451#issuecomment-205520151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/17451","id":205520151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTUyMDE1MQ==","user":{"login":"iquito","id":973653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzY1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/973653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iquito","html_url":"https://github.com/iquito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iquito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iquito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iquito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iquito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iquito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iquito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iquito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iquito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iquito/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T22:18:16Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T22:18:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, I created a discussion there: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/get-api-requests-sometimes-slow-up-to-200ms-instead-of-2ms/46301\n\nThe symptoms I am experiencing are just so over the place and only concern ES (and I switched all servers around just to try it out - so the server hardware should not be a factor) that I do not know what else to try. I can even reproduce a version of these slow responses, but I do not know what else I can test to find the root cause. Nothing in the Elasticsearch documentation has any hint on how to \"debug\" something like this.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
