The connection timeout is 45s by default. Maybe the connection hangs?\n\nAt the moment we log this under debug, because we use the standard sniffing mechanism to validate the new nodes and that one runs frequently so you don't want to spam the logs:\n\n```\n logger.debug(\"failed to connect to node [{}], removed from nodes list\", e, listedNode);\n```\n\nHowever, if we do succeed to connect/are already connected but fail to get a response from our (recently added) liveness ping, we log it in info:\n\n```\nlogger.info(\"failed to get node info for {}, disconnecting...\", e, listedNode);\n```\n\nLooks to me like we should report on a connection failure in info as well.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
