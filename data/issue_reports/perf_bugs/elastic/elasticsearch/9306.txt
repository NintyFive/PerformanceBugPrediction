in the process of upgrading from 0.90.5 to 1.4.1 and we see a significant performance depredation in one of our queries.\nhttps://gist.github.com/Meidan/f862103ff344baa48b0f#file-0-90-5-query\nhttps://gist.github.com/Meidan/060dcc6f9d51d3f4ad0b#file-1-4-1-query\n\nA short profiling session shows that the biggest difference is in the \"nested native script\" part of the query, which accounted for about 10% of the total search time in 0.90.5, but now it accounts for almost 50% in 1.4.1.\nMost of that time is spent in org.elasticsearch.search.lookup.DocLookup.get(Object), which in turn calls a lot to org.elasticsearch.index.fielddata.ordinals.SinglePackedOrdinals$Docs.getOrd(int) and the script looks something like this:\n\n``` java\n    private Map<String, Double> multipliers;\n    public float runAsFloat() {\n        ScriptDocValues.Strings term = (ScriptDocValues.Strings)doc().get(\"nested document term\");\n        ScriptDocValues.Doubles strength = (ScriptDocValues.Doubles) doc().get(\"nested document term strength\");\n\n        double score = multipliers.get(term.getValue()) * (1 + strength.getValue());\n        return (float)score;\n    }\n```\n\nAny idea on what changed between 0.90.5 and 1.4.1 that could have caused this?\nIs there a better way of doing DocLookup that I'm missing?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jpountz","id":299848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/299848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz","html_url":"https://github.com/jpountz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpountz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
