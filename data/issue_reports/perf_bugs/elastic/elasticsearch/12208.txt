It happens every few days (or maybe every day).\nWhen having a closer look at the issue, I noticed that ElasticSearch was still running but stopped listening (no more listening socket) and was using about 1.2Gb of RAM (checked using ps_mem.py). Restarting it fix the issue but it is just a workaround.\n\nLooking at the logs in /var/log/elasticsearch didn't show anything wrong or any warning. There was nothing in system logs either.\n\nIs there a way I can debug that issue? Any flag that I can add to figure out what's going on?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
