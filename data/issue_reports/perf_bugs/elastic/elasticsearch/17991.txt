The only way to fix it is to do a rolling restart of all data nodes. The \"stuck\" nodes will take longer to restart under systemd and will leave a zombie java process like this: \nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nelastic+ 13067 35.4  0.0      0     0 ?        Zl   Apr16 5407:11 [java] <defunct> \n\nThey will also abandon the normal working directory and startup under a new node directory like \ncluster/nodes/1/ instead of cluster/nodes/0/ \n\nThe only way to get elasticsearch to start up under the correct node directory is to restart the server which is not desirable. \n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Install elasticsearch on multiple nodes with a shared nfs volume. \n2. Run snapshots (Our snapshots are usually backing up about 3 TB with about 100 GB new data each day ) Snapshots fail within 2 weeks to a month usually. \n\nI have also seen larger one time snapshots fail in this same manner. \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
