The reason is that we have to replay a huge number of operations that occur while we are transferring the segment files. I see two things that we can improve:\r\n\r\n- Send/replay operations concurrently like we are doing for file chunks\r\n\r\n- Before starting phase2, we check the total operations that we will replay. If the number of the pending operations crosses the [file-based recovery threshold](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/8dec0e49d561bc136091617bfa5558c3a1f866be/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/IndexSettings.java#L318-L329), then it would be better to start over the recovery.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dnhatn","id":13474362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDc0MzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13474362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn","html_url":"https://github.com/dnhatn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnhatn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
