The `EsRejectedExecutionException` is a way of communicating to your client thread that it needs to back off. It sounds like your client thread is not properly handling these exceptions.\n1. You need to catch and handle requests that fail from an `EsRejectedExecutionException`; this means that you need to back off, and retry your request later (this is true whether you're asynchronously or synchronously firing off indexing requests).\n2. Investigate increasing the size of the index queue, but only within reason. Increasing queue size is not a panacea for constantly-full queues. If you're shoving data into Elasticsearch faster than your hardware can handle, increasing the queue size will not solve your problem because that new queue size will just fill up. Stuffed queues are almost always a sign of _another_ problem.\n3. Are you sure that you have sufficient hardware here? Are your disks and CPU fast enough? Are the database and the embedded Elasticsearch on the same box competing for resources?\n\n> Seams like something il locked inside ES and when it reaches the fatal number of 200 stuck \"things\" it will stop working.\n\nI'm interpreting this statement as you saying that Elasticsearch locks up (i.e., no longer responding to requests) when this happens.

This is to stabilize production but it's only a temporary solution.\n\nAnother info I have to add is that we had to \"osgify\" ES to avoid class collition (our framework was already using an older version of lucene). For the same reason we had to `shade` the `guava` library. Having said that, no class loading problem or exception are ever thrown. And apart from this problem everything seams to work.\n\nThere are also some machine where indexing works well and that exception is never thrown.\n\nI have a jstack dump of a \"locked\" jvm if this can help. We're also thinking to enable JMX monitoring to see if we can have other usefull info too. \n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/188806371","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16224#issuecomment-188806371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16224","id":188806371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODgwNjM3MQ==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T14:24:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T14:24:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I have a jstack dump of a \"locked\" jvm if this can help.\n\nCan you share this?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/190619323","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16224#issuecomment-190619323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/16224","id":190619323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDYxOTMyMw==","user":{"login":"dam0vm3nt","id":2409466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDk0NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2409466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dam0vm3nt","html_url":"https://github.com/dam0vm3nt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dam0vm3nt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dam0vm3nt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dam0vm3nt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dam0vm3nt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dam0vm3nt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dam0vm3nt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dam0vm3nt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dam0vm3nt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dam0vm3nt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-01T08:57:12Z","updated_at":"2016-03-01T08:57:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In a few day we are going to reproduce the event and see if in the\nmeanwhile something has changed (we fixed some issues and changed some\nparameters).
