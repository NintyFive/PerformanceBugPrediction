For example, you're missing specifying the Elasticsearch version here, and our issue template explains that we do not answer general questions here. Instead, we request that you ask general questions on the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co). As such, I am going to close this issue as it is not a bug.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
