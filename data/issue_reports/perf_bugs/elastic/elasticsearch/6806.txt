In 1.0.0 indexing of percolate queries takes much longer than in 1.2.2 (around 10 times), but percolate query is much faster. With 400k queries I get tens of ms in 1.0.0 to percolate document and couple of seconds in 1.2.2. I performed all tests with default settings always on clean ES instance. Percolate document looks like:\n\n```\n{\n\"query\": {\n   \"filtered\": {\n      \"filter\": {   \n         \"and\": [      \n            {\n               \"geo_distance\": {\n                  \"distance\": \"94km\",\n                  \"location\": {\n                     \"lat\": \"97\",\n                     \"lon\": \"-76\"\n                  }       \n               }       \n            }       \n         ]       \n      },\n      \"query\": {\n         \"match\": {\n            \"_all\": \"note father surprise\"\n         }       \n      }       \n   }       \n},\n\"type\": \"offer\"\n}\n```\n\nand percolate query:\n\n```\nGET /test-index/offer/_percolate\n{\n    \"doc\": {\n        \"name\": \"note\",\n        \"location\": [-7,-80]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHas something changes with default setting of ES between these versions regarding percolate? I couldn't find anything in release notes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"martijnvg","id":580421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/580421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
