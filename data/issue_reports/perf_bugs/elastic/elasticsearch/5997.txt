Normally this succeeds but sometimes it just hangs. After 30s my Perl client times out, and shortly thereafter I see a null pointer exception in Elasticsearch. \n\nLogs of requests from the Perl client, and trace logs from Elasticsearch are available here: https://gist.github.com/clintongormley/1a4b4eae386f271e4dc9\n\nI think the problem is that not all shards are live when the delete mapping request starts, so the delete-by-query request never runs on the unstarted shards.  See https://gist.github.com/clintongormley/1a4b4eae386f271e4dc9#file-eslogs-L1353 Elasticsearch waits for successful responses from all delete-by-query requests, and so just hangs until the requests time out, and we get the NPE: https://gist.github.com/clintongormley/1a4b4eae386f271e4dc9#file-eslogs-L1642\n","closed_by":{"login":"GaelTadh","id":5190064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTAwNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5190064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh","html_url":"https://github.com/GaelTadh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaelTadh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
