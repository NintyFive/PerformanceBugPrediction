Fx. we have a geo_shape of Sweden that in v1.5.3 took < 10 s and now takes 8+ minutes.\n\nWe are seeing this in both development with Docker and AWS (not using docker).\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Install official Docker image of v2.3\n2. \n\n```\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/test -d '{\n   \"mappings\": {\n     \"dist\":{\n       \"properties\": {\n         \"areas\": {\n           \"type\": \"geo_shape\",\n           \"precision\": \"100m\"\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n }'\n```\n\n 3.\n`curl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/dist/1 -d GIST_CONTENT` where `GIST_CONTENT=` https://gist.github.com/mekanixdk/8b0178e12161375b1e8a76e16842bc0a \n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
