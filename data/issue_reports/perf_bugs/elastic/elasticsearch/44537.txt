We think it maybe useful for people need to solve slow query.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have three pieces of codes:\r\n\r\n` Code A:\r\n{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"terms\": {\r\n                \"type\": [1,2,3]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\n` Code B:\r\n{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"terms\": {\r\n                \"type\": [2,3,4]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\n` Code C:\r\n{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"match\": {\r\n                \"name\": \"Jack\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nWe treat A and B are the same kind, because their struct are the same, even though different parameters. But C is different cause of its unique struct.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we calculate query hash considering sorts. Different types (scripts/plain) or ordering are factors that will lead to different query hash.\r\n\r\nWe submit query hash/took/diff(real interval minus took) to our APM, so we can know which types of query impact performance more.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"astefan","id":893749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/893749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan","html_url":"https://github.com/astefan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astefan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
