We understand that having a lot of fields is a little problematic and we've tried our best to address those issues. We've redesigned our solution to query only on a small number of fields (~10) and also highlight on a small number of fields (~10). Queries are still allowed on any individual field though. By doing this we improved our query and highlighting performances respectively.
