This greatly reduced the memory requirements for indexing leaving more for the index buffer, reduced young garbage collection, and had a big impact on indexing performance.\n\nThe downside is that frequent updates to the same document are slower, and your benchmark is a worst case scenario.  The logic is that very frequent updates (within 1 second) to the same document is an edge case.  Usually these updates are interspersed with other changes, which would greatly reduce the number of refreshes that are required.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/259689155","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21460#issuecomment-259689155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21460","id":259689155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTY4OTE1NQ==","user":{"login":"TrustNoOne","id":1575319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzUzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1575319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrustNoOne","html_url":"https://github.com/TrustNoOne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrustNoOne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrustNoOne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrustNoOne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrustNoOne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrustNoOne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrustNoOne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrustNoOne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrustNoOne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrustNoOne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-10T13:26:05Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T13:26:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I thought this was by design but couldn't find anything, thank you for the quick reply!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
