I was expecting either to discard or truncate the token or get an error response instead of server hanging. All subsequent valid requests to the server also times out. \n\nSteps to reproduce\n1. Create a  test index using default so that the standard analyzer is used.\n2. Send the attached document to index\n    curl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/test/1 -d @bad_input.json\n\nI couldn't find a way to attach a file to the bug, so I am sharing the link to the file bad_input.json file on google drive.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4p5T-L62D0SR3dXMDlxemUweU0/edit?usp=sharing\n","closed_by":{"login":"rmuir","id":504194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDE5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/504194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir","html_url":"https://github.com/rmuir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmuir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
