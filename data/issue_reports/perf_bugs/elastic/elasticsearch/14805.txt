This is with ES 1.7.2 on a 3 node cluster.\n\nThe error that triggers it can be any legit error (this is from a popular web service and our user input can be all kinds of crap ðŸ˜‰), but once it gets one of these in a loop, it's the same error over and over and the only way to stop them is to restart each node. And just for clarity, when I say it logs over and over, these are no longer requests coming into ES. It's ES doing this all on its own internally.\n\nHere's examples: [es_errors.txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/36942/es_errors.txt)\n\n![log_search](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24766/11218447/4eb5d158-8d12-11e5-8b4a-6caafc9b5ce8.png)\n\nHave you guys ever seen this before?\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
