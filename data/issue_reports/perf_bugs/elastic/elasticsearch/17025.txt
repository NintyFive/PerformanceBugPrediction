This makes them almost entirely useless for us (since we have several hundred indices in our cluster).\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Generate some queries / indexing requests that triggers a slowlog.\n2. Look at the slowlog\n3. Scratch your head and wonder why the `type` is present, but not the `index`.\n\n**Provide logs (if relevant)**:\n\nAn example slowlog from 2.2.0:\n\n```\n[2016-03-09 16:26:15,225][TRACE][index.indexing.slowlog.index] took[4.4ms], took_millis[4], type[test], id[AVNaDew0JKS5u4ProrcX], routing[] , source[{\"name\":\"vlucas/phpdotenv\",\"version\":\"1.0.3\",\"type\":\"library\",\"description\":\"Loads environment variables from `.env` to `getenv()`, `$_ENV` and `$_SERVER` automagically.\",\"keywords\":[\"env\",\"dotenv\",\"environment\"],\"homepage\":\"http://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv\",\"license\":\"BSD\",\"authors\":[{\"name\":\"Vance Lucas\",\"email\":\"vance@vancelucas.com\",\"homepage\":\"http://www.vancelucas.com\"}],\"require\":{\"php\":\">=5.3.2\"},\"require-dev\":{\"phpunit/phpunit\":\"*\"},\"autoload\":{\"psr-0\":{\"Dotenv\":\"src/\"}}}]\n```\n\nAn example slowlog from 1.7.5:\n\n```\n[2016-03-09 16:31:42,346][WARN ][index.indexing.slowlog.index] [Prowler] [slowtest][1] took[95.7ms], took_millis[95], type[test], id[AVNaEumoVIxyp_lAGADK], routing[], source[{\"name\":\"vlucas/phpdotenv\",\"version\":\"1.0.3\",\"type\":\"library\",\"description\":\"Loads environment variables from `.env` to `getenv()`, `$_ENV` and `$_SERVER` automagically.\",\"keywords\":[\"env\",\"dotenv\",\"environment\"],\"homepage\":\"http://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv\",\"license\":\"BSD\",\"authors\":[{\"name\":\"Vance Lucas\",\"email\":\"vance@vancelucas.com\",\"homepage\":\"http://www.vancelucas.com\"}],\"require\":{\"php\":\">=5.3.2\"},\"require-dev\":{\"phpunit/phpunit\":\"*\"},\"autoload\":{\"psr-0\":{\"Dotenv\":\"src/\"}}}]\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jimczi","id":15977469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc3NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15977469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimczi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimczi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
