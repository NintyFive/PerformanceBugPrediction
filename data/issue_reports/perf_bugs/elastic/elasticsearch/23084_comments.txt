As locks are held by uid, this indicates to me that all your threads are indexing the same uid. Through the engine, indexing is single-threaded per uid. I see no indication that the translog is the problem here, but rather there appears to be a problem with your requests all using the same uid.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/278742066","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23084#issuecomment-278742066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/23084","id":278742066,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODc0MjA2Ng==","user":{"login":"avleen","id":539525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/539525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avleen","html_url":"https://github.com/avleen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avleen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avleen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avleen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avleen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avleen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avleen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avleen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avleen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avleen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-09T19:12:56Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T19:12:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Huh.
