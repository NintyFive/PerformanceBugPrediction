I marked it low-hanging-fruit but now that I look at it more closely, we don't have the indices info available when logging these lines, and adding it would require changing the `SearchContext` which may become a bigger change that I thought. That said, I am not sure that this is worth the effort.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/372777437","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12902#issuecomment-372777437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12902","id":372777437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjc3NzQzNw==","user":{"login":"jasontedor","id":4744941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDQ5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4744941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor","html_url":"https://github.com/jasontedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasontedor/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T18:48:50Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T18:48:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think that it would be a lot of work to pump this down and I am not sure about the value; we can see the two indices that are hit in the example that is given here from the six log lines.
