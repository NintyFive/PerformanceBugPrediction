Assume for example that a primary fails to replicate a write to a replica, and therefore reaches out to the master to mark the replica as stale. If the master is circuitbreaking, the primary will fail itself (ReplicationOperation.onNoLongerPrimary), which is just horrible.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
