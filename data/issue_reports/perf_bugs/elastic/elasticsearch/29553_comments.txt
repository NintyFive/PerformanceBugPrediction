Those forums are designed to support the kinds of conversations that are necessary for this sort of troubleshooting and problem diagnosis.\r\n\r\nElastic uses GitHub issues for tracking clearly identified bugs and feature requests. Since there is no specific bug identifed in your issue, it would not be possible for us to work on this as a \"bug fix\".\r\nI'm going to close this ticket for now, but I'm sure someone will be able to help you work through this issue on the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch). If that process reveals a previously unidentified bug in Elasticsearch, then we can re-open this issue.\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
