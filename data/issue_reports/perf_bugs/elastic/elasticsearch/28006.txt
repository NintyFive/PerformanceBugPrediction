Each Index has 5 Primary shards with 1 replica for each Primary.  I restarted the cluster yesterday since some of the shards had gone UNASSIGNED due to a disk space issue. Now the disk issue has been resolved and the cluster is working good after restart. However, there are 4 shards in INITIALIZING state since the past 12 hours or so. I am frequently seeing the following in logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2017-12-28 05:02:13,797][WARN ][cluster.action.shard     ] [ES_PROD] [intellinote][2] received shard failed for [intellinote][2], node[XuI6fDcvQfuclZNydldeIA], [P], s[INITIALIZING], indexUUID [sO34VtN-S6KrnIpu4s-c5g], reason [Failed to start shard, message [IndexShardGatewayRecoveryException[[intellinote][2] failed to fetch index version after copying it over]; nested: IndexShardGatewayRecoveryException[[intellinote][2] shard allocated for local recovery (post api), should exist, but doesn't, current files: \r\n```\r\nThese logs are frequently generated for all the 4 shards which are trying to INITIALIZE. Is there a way to make them STARTED without any loss of data?
