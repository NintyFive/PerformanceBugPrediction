Eg:-\nGET /_search\n{\n    \"script_fields\": {\n        \"my_field\": {\n            \"script_file\": \"my_script\",\n            \"params\": {\n              \"my_var\": 2\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nHowever the .NET NEST client does not have any support for this yet. Is this going to be added soon?\n\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/blob/4fcecae93dcf16a4ff7e110135da81eed409dda5/src/Nest/DSL/Filter/ScriptFilterDescriptor.cs#L36\n\nThanks,\nVineet\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
