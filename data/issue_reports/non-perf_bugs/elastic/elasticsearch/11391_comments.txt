We can implement our own globbing from scratch\n2. We can use a copy of `com.google.common.jimfs.GlobToRegex` (licensed under ASL 2.0) and base our implementation on that, which would then match internally using a regex.\n3. We can change the format of the property `tests.rest.blacklist` and allow only regexes\n\nIn case 1, I'm not sure whether we really need the whole set of globbing options or a subset is sufficient, I frown upon copying (case 2) and case 3 is obviously breaking and a tad more quirky to use.
