I've left the docs in the Definitive Guide, because that's for a published book and I think it is OK to duplicate it there.  However, the shutdown API has been removed in master, so I've added a deprecation notice to the 1.x branch, and just deleted the rolling restart docs from that page in 1.x (62c5361ad8d09a043d4ad800c142362045c135fd)  and 1.5 (a8c46d68a863e4be33f1d2aba24843f7940dcaf2)\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
