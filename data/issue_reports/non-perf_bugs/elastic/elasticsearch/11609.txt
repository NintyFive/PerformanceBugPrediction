The master will create subdirectories for each index, but the permissions will reflect ownership by the 'elasticsearch' user on the master.  If the master's elasticsearch user does not match the elasticsearch user id on another node, that node will not be able to write to those directories.\n\nWhen we create the 'elasticsearch' user and group at installation time, it would be helpful to have a consistent id number.  I don't know if the best solution is to pick an arbitrary high user ID number (9200?) and try to use it by default, or just to document that it needs to be set the same across all nodes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rjernst","id":289412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/289412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst","html_url":"https://github.com/rjernst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rjernst/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
