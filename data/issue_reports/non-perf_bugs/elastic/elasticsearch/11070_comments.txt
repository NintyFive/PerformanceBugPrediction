Instead, it is part of the `BigArrays` class which is a generic class that chunks of byte arrays are requested from. This is nice from a programming level because they are decoupled, but not as nice from an end-user perspective because there is no notion of the actual search/agg request, just the byte array that was requested.\n\nNow, multiple queries using `BigArrays` _should_ be using the same circuit breaker and thus already be at the node level, however, for things like @pickypg mentioned, the `terms` aggregation does not currently go through the request breaker (needs to be added!), which is why it can still kill a node.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/192242977","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11070#issuecomment-192242977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11070","id":192242977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjI0Mjk3Nw==","user":{"login":"pweerd","id":1112783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTI3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1112783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pweerd","html_url":"https://github.com/pweerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pweerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pweerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pweerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pweerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pweerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pweerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pweerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pweerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pweerd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-04T11:30:32Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T11:30:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Does someone know what the outlook for this feature is?\nI really would like this feature, because currently same user requests blowup a client node.
