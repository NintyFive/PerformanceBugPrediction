I know about the mailing but I just didn't see my mistake and after trying for some time assumed it was a bug. My bad.\n@s1monw  The idea was not to lowercase with `whitespace` tokenizer but to create a scenario reproducing the invalid \"bug\". But thank you.\n\nHowever it seems to me that this shows another issue. Maybe creating a custom `_all` field without explicitly disabling the default `_all` field should return an error? Especially if the new field cannot be accessed.\nOnce I disable the default `_all` field with `\"_all\": { \"enabled\": false }`. I have a normal behavior, i.e. no result for the two last queries.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/114944631","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11851#issuecomment-114944631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11851","id":114944631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDk0NDYzMQ==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-24T17:12:48Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T17:12:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Relates to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/10456\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
