Index wildcards also support a leading `-` to exclude matches.\n\nI'd like to propose that we standardise the syntax across all APIs that use wildcard matching, as follows:\n- `*` matches zero or more characters up to but not including a period `.`\n- `**` matches all zero or more characters including a period\n- multiple patterns can be separated by a comma `,`\n- any pattern can be preceded by a `+` to include matches (the default if not specified) or a `-` to exclude matches\n- it should be possible to escape any of these characters: `*`, `+`, `-`, `,`, `\\` with a preceding `\\`\n\nRelates to #11294\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
