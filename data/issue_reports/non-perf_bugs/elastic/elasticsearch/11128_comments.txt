The heavy lifting of this feature is the key management. It matters less whether we pass this key to a SDK API or the JCE API it is more important where we get the key from and how we can rotate/disable them. The scope of the key is also important, whether the key is used for a snapshot or for a repository. Symmetric key vs Asymmetric key is another topic.\r\n\r\nChanging the key is especially difficult. The snapshot implementation would have to be modified if we were to allow for keys to change for each snapshot operation. This is because the \"index\" file would have to be unencrypted (contrasting with the other files) for a new snapshot with another key to be incremental; and restoring would require all the keys.\r\n\r\nUsing a fixed key per repository (which cannot be changed for the lifetime of the repository) is a better alternative. The snapshot format will not have to change.  However, keys have to be periodically changed (rotated) - a requirement by policies. Changing keys requires decrypting with the old key and re-encrypting with the new key. This however requires new code to avoid the heavy handed approach of restoring using the old key and then snapshotting to a new repository using the new key. Curiously there is [no support](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/1686) for rotating keys in the AWS cmd line utility. Thinking about implementing this rotation mechanism got as wondering about the use cases here, to evaluate the tradeoffs: Who really uses this feature (when there is TLS + server side encryption)? Do they store the keys of the disk or have a vault-like service? How do they go about rotating them? Do they really want the data leaving their on premise cluster (even if encrypted)?\r\n\r\nSo, the main open question is: In a model with one immutable key per repository, how do we rotate keys?\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/446684903","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11128#issuecomment-446684903","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11128","id":446684903,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjY4NDkwMw==","user":{"login":"albertzaharovits","id":4568420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njg0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4568420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits","html_url":"https://github.com/albertzaharovits","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertzaharovits/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-12T18:05:19Z","updated_at":"2018-12-12T18:05:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"And another question: Is having the encryption key on the data nodes be suitable for the users of \"client side encryption\".

We have again focused on the key management topic. For the moment we are undecided whether to use SDK or JCE support to do the encryption (it depends on other decisions).\r\n\r\nWe have though about it under the assumption that a repository has a fixed key. Key rotation should ideally be handled outside of elasticsearch because this rotation mechanism is independent of the snapshot format (this is to be generic, specific only for the storage type).\r\n\r\nAll the data nodes (participating in the snapshot) have to have the same key. This is a requirement\r\nfor other features that we work on (e.g. hashing processor).\r\n\r\nAzure and AWS employ [envelope encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping) for easy key rotation, however they don't provide client cmd line utility to do this rotation, as these CLIs tools don't have client side encryption support https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/1686 . The only way to do key rotation is by using their respective \"key vault\" services: [\"KMS\" (Key Management Service)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html). This made us wonder if key management on the client application (client from the cloud provider's perspective, ES nodes, to be clear) is truly a feature requested by the kind of customers that are asking for this type of encryption in the first place (the option of TLS + server side encryption is broadly available and accessible). It might be that many are interested primarily in abiding to standards and norms  and these standards preclude non audited key management services (like the one we would like to develop).\r\n\r\nWe are torn between:\r\n* satisfying the ultra suspicious not wanting the encryption keys to ever leave the local network\r\n* satisfying the ultra religious wanting to abide to standards even if the improvement over TLS + server side encryption is marginal.\r\n* or both ...\r\n\r\nCC @joshbressers \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/513464524","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11128#issuecomment-513464524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11128","id":513464524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzQ2NDUyNA==","user":{"login":"original-brownbear","id":6490959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTA5NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6490959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear","html_url":"https://github.com/original-brownbear","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/original-brownbear/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-20T12:45:07Z","updated_at":"2019-07-20T12:45:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing this as a duplicate of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/41910 where this will be implemented in some form eventually.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
