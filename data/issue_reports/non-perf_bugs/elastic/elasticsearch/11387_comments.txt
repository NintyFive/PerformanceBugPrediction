That said, Shield realm infrastructure was built with that in mind. We're working on exposing the appropriate extension points in Shield such that you'll be able to write and plug in you own realm implementation. This option will be available in the one of the next few releases (targeted to this year).\n\nAs a side note, if you have more questions around this topic or Shield in general, please post them on our dedicated shield forum at https://discuss.elastic.co/c/shield (elasticsearch repo is not the best place for it... so I'll be closing this issue)\n\nthx!\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
