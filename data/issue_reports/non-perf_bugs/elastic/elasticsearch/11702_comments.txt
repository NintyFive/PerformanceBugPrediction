The former (elasticsearch) would not be master-eligible. The later would be master-eligible. They would have two different homes (configuration directories, etc). Users needing a master and data node on a single server would need to enable _both_ services.\n\nI do worry about users accidentally forgetting to run the master node or that users would accidentally run the data node when they really didn't want to.
