Definitely a great feature candidate.\nI have implemented this by storing set of \"random\" numbers e.g. each object has say 20 additional integers (each one of these is a sorting field named as rand1, rand2, rand3 etc). For each user I select (calculate based on date and  UA)  number  1...20 which is used to select which \"random\" field will be used. When new objects are added each simply receives set of random. Umbers. You decide how many random states you need. Remember that reverse order in this case doubles the number of random states. This solution is all about perception.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/4630073","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1170#issuecomment-4630073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/1170","id":4630073,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzAwNzM=","user":{"login":"mattiassvedhem","id":721122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTEyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/721122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattiassvedhem","html_url":"https://github.com/mattiassvedhem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattiassvedhem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattiassvedhem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattiassvedhem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattiassvedhem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattiassvedhem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattiassvedhem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattiassvedhem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattiassvedhem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattiassvedhem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-03-22T00:08:28Z","updated_at":"2012-03-22T00:08:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Cool!
