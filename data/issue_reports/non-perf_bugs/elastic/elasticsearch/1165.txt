The `length` parameter can control its length, defaults to `10` (so you can use it as is, without \"defining\" it, and it will truncate to 10).\n\nIt'd be useful to be able to truncate tokens to a max length for sorting purposes.\n\nFor instance, I index a `name` field and i want it analyzed (so that i can search on it) but have it as a multi-field with a not-analyzed or keyword version to sort on, but I don't need to store all 100 characters, just the first 10 characters.\n\nOf course, it would need to take unicode into account so that it doesn't split up a multicode character\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
