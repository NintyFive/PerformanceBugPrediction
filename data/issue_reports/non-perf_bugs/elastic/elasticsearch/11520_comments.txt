However, this file has been truncated, which indicates a hardware problem (eg your disk actually cached the writes instead of really doing an fsync).\n\nWhat you can try to do is to delete that file. With it out of the way, the node should start and (hopefully, if you have replicas on another node) find another  copy of the shard elsewhere.  If you don't have replicas then you have probably lost the data in that shard.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/172494718","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11520#issuecomment-172494718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11520","id":172494718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjQ5NDcxOA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-18T10:44:21Z","updated_at":"2016-01-18T10:44:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No more feedback.
