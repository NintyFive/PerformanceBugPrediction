(vs. Splunk, where almost everything happens during search time, thus you can adjust your plans).\n\nCurrently, in order to test my new mapping params, I have to  (using kopf plugin -- otherwise I'd throw ES immediately out of window for lack of usability):\n1. Have my data ready -- either stored in some safe index or in local .json file on disk\n2. delete index / index template  -- `/_plugin/kopf/#!/cluster`\n3. adjust index appropriately and create it   -- `/_plugin/kopf/#!/createIndex`\n4. Use **stream2es** in order to copy index from \"safe place\" to the index above -- `cat mydata.json | stream2es  stdin --target http://blah:9200/newidx/type1`\n   OR \n   `stream2es es --source http://blah:9200/safe_idx/type1 --target http://blah:9200/newidx/type1`\n5. Run some query, see it failing/misbehaving, read docs, see that you need mapping adjustment, GO TO step #2.\n\nNow imagine doing this 50 times, because you can't get ES behave properly with your data....\nThis is very tedious for someone who expected modern easy-to-use software.\n\nIdeally, I want to input my new mapping, press button, and let it do the reindex automatically. \nOf course, this would be useful for dev env only as on production, you'd sync the mapping changes with app schema changes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
