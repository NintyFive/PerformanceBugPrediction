If the feature would do the merging (sorting the analysis-result tokens by offset) it could even do what the elasticsearch-analysis-combo plugin does (and circumvent the analyser cloning).\n\nMore importantly, it could even be used as a pre-analysed field content feature similar to Solr's PreAnalyzed field type and PreAnalyzedUpdateProcessor: When you could specify multiple fields in the JSON document to end haveing the same Lucene document name (that part is important), you could have one JSON field stored, but not analyzed with the original text and another field not stored and delivered with a serialized version of a custom TokenStream created externally (e.g. as in the Solr case: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/JsonPreAnalyzedParser)).\nIf the resulting Lucene fields had the same name, even highlighting should work correctly, similarly as when using the synonym filter: You search for a synonym but not only find documents containing the original word but also have those highlighted.\n\nThis does not work when mapping to JSON fields using the \"index_name\" property. Example:\n{\n\"text\":{\"type\": \"string\",\"index\": \"no\",\"store\":\"yes\"},\n\"text_analyzed\":{\"type\": \"string\",\"index\": \"analyzed\",\"term_vector\" : \"with_positions_offsets\", \"index_name\":\"text\"}\n}\nNote the \"index_name\":\"text\" part of the \"text_analyzed\" field.\nThis approach does not work with highlighting. I'm not exactly sure why, but most probably because internally we still have to fields \"text\" and \"text_analyzed\" where the second only gets an alias to \"text\".\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
