The filter itself can be quite big, memory wise, for example, when using a terms filter with many terms. Allow to associate a custom cache key (that should be unique based on the content of the filter) that will be used instead of the actual filter, thus reserving memory. For example, a user based filter of friends can be cached like this (for a user named kimchy):\n\n```\n{\n    \"terms\" : {\n        \"friends\" : [\"first\", \"second\", \"third\"],\n        \"_cache_key\" : \"kimchy_friends\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWill cache the filter under `kimchy_friends`, instead of using the filter itself (which includes the whole list of friends).\n\nThe `_cache_key` can be placed on all filters, in the same level as `_cache` and `_name`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
