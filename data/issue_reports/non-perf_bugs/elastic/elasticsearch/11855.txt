Default _all field is still used.\n\nDELETE myindex\n\nPOST myindex\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"record\": {\n      \"_all\": { \"enabled\": false },\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"_all\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          }\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT myindex/record/1\n{\n  \"title\": \"my big universe\"\n}\n\nGET myindex/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"_all\": \"Universe\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n==> no result. OK\n\n```\n\nBut strangely the search does not work even when I write in the `_all` field.\n\n```\nPUT myindex/record/1\n{\n  \"_all\": \"Universe\"\n}\n\nGET myindex/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"_all\": \"Universe\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n==> no document even though the _all field has been disabled before. KO\n```\n\nI am using the elasticsearch 1.6 container from docker.io\n\nThis is a minor issue as most people won't name their custom fields `_all`. Throwing an error in the mean time could be useful for people misplacing `_all` in their mapping. Or maybe forbidding completely the definition of a field named `_all`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
