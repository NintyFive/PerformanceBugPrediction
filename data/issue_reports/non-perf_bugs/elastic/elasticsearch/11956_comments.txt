We don't support even simple term-based distributed joins because the performance would be terrible (and wouldn't scale).  That said, using a list of shapes in a \"geo-terms\" aggregation, with intersecting shapes collected in each bucket, might be an interesting idea.\n\n@nknize @jpountz any thoughts?\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/117617047","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11956#issuecomment-117617047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11956","id":117617047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzYxNzA0Nw==","user":{"login":"giaconiamark","id":7518558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTg1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7518558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaconiamark","html_url":"https://github.com/giaconiamark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaconiamark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaconiamark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaconiamark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaconiamark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaconiamark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaconiamark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaconiamark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaconiamark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaconiamark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T11:23:29Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T11:28:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, the ladder is something like I need... I need buckets with an itemid and count of shapes that intersected that shape, grouped by type. What I think it amounts to is a bucket aggregation, but with a collection of shapes as a filter, and it would return buckets containing the shape and id of each shape in the collection.\nThe purpose (use case) for this is to understand density of shapes.\nI have a cluster with well over a billion shapes, and need to know basic things like \"where are the most roads?\" and \"where do I not have buildings\" etc.\nI think each item in the returned json array would look something like this psuedo\n\"buckets:\".....\n\n\"bucket\":{\n  \"join_shape\":{..polygon of coords...},\n  \"intersectingFeatureCountsByType:{  \n    \"road\":234},  \n    \"river\":190,\n    \"building\":756,\n    \"etc...\":869678}\n}\nan array of these would allow me to do very interesting visualizations across the globe of what I have where...likely wouldn't ever produce more than a few hundred polygons (it would be based on zoom level).\n\nright now I accomplish this manually by generating my own grid of polygons, and doing a bbox intersects with each box to get a count of features that overlap on my webserver.\nIt should act very similar to what a geohash agg currently does, except this works off of another index of shapes or a query for shapes.\n\nHope this helps\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/120337615","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11956#issuecomment-120337615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11956","id":120337615,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMDMzNzYxNQ==","user":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-10T10:06:14Z","updated_at":"2015-07-10T10:06:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@giaconiamark I think you should be able to achieve this already with the filters aggregation?
