This is a lightweight GeoPoint type with a simple API that indexes geopoints only and provides GeoPointInBBoxQuery and GeoPointInPolygonQuery classes.  It is currently an experimental sandbox feature that needs to be baked before full release (targeting ES 2.0).\n\nThis feature adds GeoPointField as the default indexing FieldType for `geo_point` mappings. It also updates Grid Aggregations, BoundingBox, and Polygon queries to use the new GeoPointInBBoxQuery and GeoPointInPolygonQuery classes.  This will be exposed on a feature branch and added as an experimental feature prior to full release.\n","closed_by":{"login":"nknize","id":830187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDE4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/830187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize","html_url":"https://github.com/nknize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nknize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
