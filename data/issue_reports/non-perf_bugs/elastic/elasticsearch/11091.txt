The way scripts are defined in requests is still not one consistent method across the codebase. We want scripts to be defined in an object containing the script, params, lang, and type. This will be defined in the request in the following way:\n\nInline Scripts:\n\n``` json\n...\n\"script\": {\n    \"inline\": \"doc[foo] + 1\",\n    \"lang\": \"groovy\",\n    \"params\": {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n...\n```\n\nFile Scripts:\n\n``` json\n...\n\"script\": {\n    \"file\": \"my_file_script\",\n    \"lang\": \"groovy\",\n    \"params\": {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n...\n```\n\nIndex Scripts:\n\n``` json\n...\n\"script\": {\n    \"id\": \"my_indexed_script\",\n    \"lang\": \"groovy\",\n    \"params\": {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n...\n```\n\nInline scripts can also be specified using the following short form, but the language will be the default language and the params will be empty:\n\n``` json\n...\n\"script\": \"doc[foo] + 1\"\n...\n```\n\nWe should have similar constructs for templates. Also, the script and template classes should be available in the Java API and should be able to parse and render (build) themselves in XContent as well as being able to be serialized between nodes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"colings86","id":236731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/236731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86","html_url":"https://github.com/colings86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colings86/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
