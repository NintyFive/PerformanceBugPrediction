That makes more sense. Changing the code to \n\n``` java\nPercolateResponse filteredResult = client.preparePercolate()\n    .setIndices(INDEX)\n    .setDocumentType(tweet.getType())\n    .setPercolateDoc(new DocBuilder().setDoc(doc))\n    .setPercolateFilter(FilterBuilders.termFilter(\"userId\", 1))\n    .execute().actionGet();\n```\n\nActually works! The documentation doesn't seem to be clear that using setSource assumes that the end user needs to craft the whole source by hand, and there weren't many sources around the internet showcasing how to do filtering in percolate queries with the Java API. I would be happy to submit a PR with an updated version of [the percolate API](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/current/percolate.html) including an example of using filters.
