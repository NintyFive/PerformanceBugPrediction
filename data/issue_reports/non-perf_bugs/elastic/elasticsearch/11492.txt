I want to have multiple indices for the events' dates.\n\nI found out that when I reduce the 'flush_size' of logstash things work fine but getting data into ES like this is extremely slow.\n\nAnother thing I found later is that when I set the following config to elasticsearch:\n\n```\nthreadpool.search.type: fixed\nthreadpool.search.size: 20\nthreadpool.search.queue_size: 100\n\nthreadpool.bulk.type: fixed\nthreadpool.bulk.size: 60\nthreadpool.bulk.queue_size: 500\n\nthreadpool.index.type: fixed\nthreadpool.index.size: 20\nthreadpool.index.queue_size: 100\n\nindices.memory.index_buffer_size: 30%\nindices.memory.min_shard_index_buffer_size: 12mb\nindices.memory.min_index_buffer_size: 96mb\n\n\nindices.fielddata.cache.size: 15%\nindices.fielddata.cache.expire: 6h\nindices.cache.filter.size: 15%\nindices.cache.filter.expire: 6h\n\nindex.refresh_interval: 30s\nindex.translog.flush_threshold_ops: 50000\n```\n\nI can raise the bulk size to 1000 and everything works but the machine gets stuck and things are REALLY slow.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated ... :pray: \n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
