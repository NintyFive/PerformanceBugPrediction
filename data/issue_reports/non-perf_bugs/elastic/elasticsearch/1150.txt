Here's the steps:\n\n1] Run an mvel script that doesn't work in JS:\n\n  \"script_fields\":{\n    \"test1\":{\n      \"script\":\"toRadians(0)\",\n    }\n  },\n\n2] Switch the language to JS \n\n  \"script_fields\":{\n    \"test1\":{\n      \"script\":\"toRadians(0)\",\n      \"lang\":\"js\"\n    }\n  },\n\nThis returns exactly the same response\n\n3] Now make a trivial change to the script:\n\n  \"script_fields\":{\n    \"test1\":{\n      \"script\":\"0+toRadians(0)\",\n      \"lang\":\"js\"\n    }\n  },\n\nThis fails with the expected \"EcmaError[ReferenceError: \"toRadians\" is not defined. (Script3.js#1)]\" error\n\nSo it looks like in step [2] it's just re-submitted the original cached? mvel query\n\n4]  if I now change lang to be mvel, ie same script:\n\n  \"script_fields\":{\n    \"test1\":{\n      \"script\":\"0+toRadians(0)\",\n      \"lang\":\"mvel\"\n    }\n  },\n\nIt continues to fail, ie the (erroring) script has been cached.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimchy","id":41300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/41300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy","html_url":"https://github.com/kimchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimchy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
