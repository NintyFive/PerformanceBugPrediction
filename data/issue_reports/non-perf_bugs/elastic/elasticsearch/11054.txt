This got some nice debate going with endresult being: it's possible with some hacking. A couple of years later (2013) it was possible out of the box with [solr](http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Modeling-openinghours-using-multipoints-td4025336.html) \n\nPartially based on that Chris Hostetter (a.k.a. Hossman) did the following [presentation](https://people.apache.org/~hossman/spatial-for-non-spatial-meetup-20130117/) in 2013, which nicely outlines several usecases (all sharing a temporal component) using geo-polygon intersections, etc.  \n\nQuestion: \n1. are all these geo polygon intersection/overlap related queries possible with Elasticsearch as well? Geo Polygon Filter seems the way go to, but like to know the support for the above. \n2. Is there a way to define x/y instead of lat/long for ease-of-use? I.e.: getting the geo part out of geo-spatial? \n","closed_by":{"login":"imotov","id":655851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/655851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov","html_url":"https://github.com/imotov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imotov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
