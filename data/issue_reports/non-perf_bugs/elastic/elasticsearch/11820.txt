May 20, 2015 Joseph Beressi Senior Executive Vice President Chief Accountant REVIEW REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF ISRAEL DISCOUNT BANK LTD. We have reviewed the accompanying financial information of Israel Discount Bank Ltd. and its subsidiaries (hereinafter: \\\"the Bank\\\") comprising of the condensed consolidated interim balance sheet as at March 31, 2015 and the related condensed consolidated interim statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the three months period then ended. The Board of Directors and management are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the financial data for this interim period in accordance with Israeli GAAP regarding financial reporting for this interim period and in accordance with the guidelines and directives of the Supervisor of Banks. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the financial information for these interim periods based on our review. INTRODUCTION We have conducted our review in accordance with Standard on Review Engagements 1, \\\"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\\\" of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Israel, and a review standard applied in the review of banking institutions according to the guidelines and directives of the Supervisor of Banks. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Israel and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. SCOPE OF REVIEW Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying financial information was not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Israeli GAAP regarding financial reporting for interim periods and in accordance with the instructions and directives of the Supervisor of Banks. CONCLUSION Without qualifying our above conclusion, we call attention to the Note 8 B items 4.9 and 5 concerning motion to approve certain lawsuits as class action suits and with regard to other claims against the Bank and investee companies and to that stated in Note 16 b (2) with respect to the notice given by the State Attorney Office, according to which the State Attorney is considering the filing of an indictment against ICC. According to the said Note, at this stage, the Managements of ICC and the Bank are unable to assess the results of the proceedings that would be instituted, if at all, and their consequences on ICC.

The Bank is preparing for the implementation of the new policy. The following principal subjects are included in the said framework: 1. Definition of a process for the determination of the discount rate on the basis of Israeli CPI linked government bonds, in accordance with the average period to maturity of the estimated indebtedness, with the addition of an average spread of U.S. corporate bonds having a rating of AA and above. The process includes aspects of control of the appropriateness of choosing the bonds, validation of the resultant discount rate and examination of the reasonableness of changes in the discount rate. 2. Determination of a mechanism for defining the forecasted return on assets of the plan. The parameters used in determining the forecasted return are mostly the actual and past composition of the plan's assets, possible changes in the composition of the assets in accordance with the investment policy, as defined, past yields of the fund, the yield of the assets and its weight in the total portfolio, after deduction of operating expenses and commissions. The mechanism also includes examination of the need for the updating of the forecasted return during the reported period. 3. The change in the method of measurement of the Bank's liability in respect of benefits to retirees in relation to the population of active employees, and the transition to computing the liability on the date on which it becomes certain. This, instead of a computation assuming retirement rates prior to the age of 67 and a pro-rata charge in accordance therewith. 4. Definition of the work process for the treatment of actuarial profits and losses, differentiating in the framework thereof between: - The actuarial loss arising from the change in the discount rate as of January 1, 2013; Actuarial profits that would arise from changes in the discount rate subsequent to the date of initial implementation; - - Actuarial losses arising from changes in the discount rate and from other components subsequent to the date of initial - Actuarial profits/losses arising from the difference between the forecasted return on the plan's assets and the return actually The process includes reference to reasonableness of the resultant actuarial profit/loss, the accounting records, the mechanism for the amortization of the profits/losses and the determination of the amortization period. Post retirement benefits - defined deposits plans The Bank recognizes amounts relating to pension and severance plans and other post retirement plans on the basis of computations that include actuarial and other assumptions, including: discount rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, forecasted long-term return rates on assets of the plan, remuneration increases and employee turnover; The Bank reviews its assumptions on a periodic basis and updates these assumptions where required. As a general rule, the actuarial estimates are made once a year, unless material changes occur in the actuarial assumptions in the interim period, which materially impact the actuarial liabilities or the assets of the plan; Changes in assumptions are in general recognized, subject to the instructions stated above, firstly in accumulated other comprehensive income, and are amortized to the statement of income in following periods; The liability is accumulated over the relevant period determined in accordance with the rules detailed in item 715 of the codification; The Bank implements the guidelines issued by the Supervisor of Banks with respect to internal control over the financial reporting process in the matter of employee rights, including with respect to examining the \\\"liability in substance\\\" of the Bank to grant its employees benefits comprising increased severance pay and/or early pension. A defined deposit plan is a plan according to which the Bank deposits fixed amounts with a third party, thereby avoiding any legal or inferred liability for additional payments. The Bank's commitment to deposit in the defined deposit plan, are recognized as an expense in the statement of income in the periods during which the employees have provided the relevant services. - - - - - - implementation; earned. - Post retirement benefits - pension, severance pay and other benefits - defined benefits plans - 1.

The Standard states that income shall be recognized by the implementation of a five stage model, which, among other things, include rules for the identification of the contract with the customer and for the determination of the transaction price, rules defining how the different components of the contract should be separated and the manner by which the total transaction price should be attributed to each separate and identified component. Furthermore, in accordance with the provisions of the Standard, income is to be recognized in respect of each identified component separately, and this in accordance with rules stated by the Standard with respect to the timing of recognition of the income - at a specific date or over a period of time. The amendments in the Directives will apply as from January 1, 2017. In accordance with the transitional instructions of the circular, upon initial implementation it would be possible to elect the retroactive application alternative by way of a restatement of the comparative data, or the alternative of retroactive application by way of recording the cumulative effect of the initial implementation of the Standard, while attributing the cumulative effect, to be recognized at date of the initial implementation, to the equity. IMPLEMENTATION 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Israel Discount Bank Limited and its Subsidiaries The new standard does not apply, among other things, to financial instruments and to contractual rights or liabilities under Chapter 310 of the Codification. The Bank has not yet examined the effect of the standard on its financial statements, and has not yet elected the alternative manner of implementation of the transitional instructions. 3. Guidelines in the matter of capitalization of in-house software development costs. The Bank implements International Accounting Standard No. 38 \\\"Intangible assets\\\" and the guidelines determined by \\\"SOP 98-1 - Accounting for the cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use\\\". Due to the accounting complexity involved in the process of capitalizing in-house software development costs, and in view of the materiality of the amounts of software costs capitalized, the Supervisor of Banks has determined guidelines for the Bank in the matter of capitalization of software costs, as follows: - A minimum materiality level of between NIS 450 thousand and NIS 600 thousand, shall be determined for each software development project, in respect of which software development costs are capitalized. Any software development project, the total cost of which is lower than the determined materiality level, shall be recognized as an expense in the statement of income; The period of amortization of software development costs shall not exceed five years; - - Capitalization coefficients of lower that 1, shall be determined for hours worked, taking into consideration the potential for deviation in - The change in the accounting policy in accordance with the said guidelines shall be implemented starting with the interim financial statements as of June 30, 2015, by way of retroactive implementation, with a restatement of the comparative data. It is noted, that to the Bank's best knowledge, similar guidelines have been determined for other banking corporations in Israel. According to a preliminary assessment of the Bank, implementation of the requirements included in the draft, would reduce the equity by an amount of NIS 100 million after tax. It is noted that as from January 1, 2015, the Bank implements the contents of the draft with respect to current projects - as regards the materiality threshold with respect to capitalization coefficients and with respect to the level of employees whose costs are capitalized. computing the hours worked and the lack of economic efficiency; Limiting the level of employees, the costs of whom are to be capitalized.

Details regarding the terms \\\"Mortgage-backed Securities - MBS\\\", \\\"Mortgage Pass - Through\\\" and \\\"Collateralized Mortgage Obligation - CMO\\\" were brought in Note 3 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014. E. Most of the unrealized losses at March 31, 2015 are attributed to certain factors, including changes in market interest rate subsequent to acquisition, an increase in margins occurring in the credit market concerning similar types of securities, the impact of inactive markets and changes in the rating of securities. For debt securities, there are no securities past due or securities for which the Bank and/or it's relevant consolidated companies estimates that it is not probable that they will be able to collect all the amounts owed to them, pursuant to the investment contracts. Since the Bank and the relevant consolidated subsidiaries have the ability and intent to hold on to securities with unrealized losses until a market price recovery (which for debt securities, might not be until maturity), the Bank and the relevant consolidated subsidiaries do not view the impairment in value of these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at March 31, 2015.

CREDIT RISK, CREDIT TO THE PUBLIC AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (CONTINUED) Sensitivity to the domestic economic cycle in Israel. In addition, in view of material overseas investments by large Israeli corporations, the level of exposure to global crises increased; Sensitivity to private consumption; Exposure to foreign competition; In view of the high concentration of the ownership and control structure of corporations in the Israeli market - credit is typified by high concentration at the large borrower groups' level. Furthermore, the structure of the holding groups and their indebtedness at several levels within the holding corporations, increase the credit risk and the vulnerability of these corporations. Loans involving a high finance ratio carry risk in the event of impairment in the value of collateral below the balance of the loan. The Bank's underwriting policy limits the ratio of finance when granting a loan. Exposure to retail credit is affected by macro-economic factors. Intensification of competition in the banking system in recent years may lead to erosion in margins, decline in quality of borrowers with a resultant increase in credit risk. The credit policy does not allow at the present time the granting of credit to customers having a low internal credit rating, thus moderating such risks. - - - - (2) Credit to private individuals - housing loans - (3) Credit to private individuals - other - - (B) Indication of credit quality December 31, 2014 Total Commercial March 31, 2015 Private Individuals Housing Loans Other Loans Total Commercial Private Individuals Housing Loans Other Loans B.

CREDIT RISK, CREDIT TO THE PUBLIC AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (CONTINUED) The period in arrears of debt is a central factor in determining the classification of the Bank's debts, and accordingly affects the allowance for credit losses and the accounting write-offs. A debt examined on a specific basis is classified as impaired when payments of principal or interest in respect thereof are in arrears of ninety days or over, except where the debt is well secured and is in the process of collection. A principal indication for the quality of the Bank's credit portfolio is the ratio of problematic debts at the Bank. During the first three months of 2015, the rate of performing credit to the public increased, stemming mainly from the commercial sector. This increase was accompanied by a decline in unimpaired problematic credit. B. Debts (continued) 3. Additional disclosure regarding the quality of credit (continued) 4.

The future payroll increase used to compute the amount of the liabilities for employee rights, in respect of the Bank's employees, is 1.8% per year (December 31, 2014: 2.5% per year). An agreement with the representatives of the employees was signed in 2007, regarding the \\\"Jubilee vacation\\\" days, according to which, among other things, the entitlement of new employees to \\\"Jubilee vacation\\\" was abolished. In 2011, the Bank signed with the representative committee of the employees a \\\"grades and stages\\\" agreement, according to which, among other things, new employees engaged or moved to the position of regular employees as from January 1, 2012, shall not be entitled to a \\\"jubilee award\\\". (6) Employees of the Bank and its consolidated subsidiaries in Israel are entitled to annual vacation as provided by labor agreements in force, and subject to the guidelines of the Annual Vacation Law - 1951. The liability for vacation pay is recognized over the period of employment in which the right to paid vacation accumulates. The liability is determined on the basis of the most recent salary in the reporting period with the addition of related payments. (7) Employees of the Bank and its subsidiaries are entitled to certain benefits after retirement. The said liability is computed on an actuarial basis and is recognized over the period of employment of the employee. In addition, some of the employees who accepted early retirement exchanged their retirement award with a pension for a determined period. This liability is presented at its discounted value. B.

Contingent liabilities and other special commitments (continued) The Bank responded to the motion to approve the claim as a class action suit. On May 15, 2008, the Court decided to stay the proceedings until a ruling is given in the appeal filed by the banks with respect to the action described in item 4.1 above. A decision was given on January 21, 2014, instructing the transfer of the hearing of the motion for approval of the claim as a class action in this case, to the District Court hearing the lawsuit described in item 4.1 above. The parties to the case conducted negotiations for reaching a compromise in the matter, which were unsuccessful. For details regarding the opposition by the Plaintiffs in this proceeding to the compromise arrangement discussed in item 4.1 above, see item 4.1 above. On March 15, 2015, the Plaintiff in these proceedings filed his response to questions raised by the Court in the proceedings described in item 4.1 above. The Attorney General of the Government submitted his position on March 24, 2015, according to which the hearing of the lawsuits should not be combined (in this item and item 4.1 above). Alternatively, in the event that the Court decides to combine the hearings, it is the opinion of the Attorney General that it would not be possible to reach a compromise if certain of the parties oppose it. The decision of the Court was given on March 25, 2015, as detailed in item 4.1 above. 4.3 Note 19 C 12.4 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described an action together with a motion to approve the action as a class action suit, filed on April 27, 2009, against the Bank, Bank Leumi, Bank Hapoalim, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank and the First International Bank. The Claimants argue that a binding arrangement had existed between the said banks with respect to commission rates charged by these banks and that the banks established a coordinated policy, which, as alleged by the claimants, was typified by prohibited cooperation and exchange of information. The class defined in the action constitutes all customers of the defendant banks, both private and business customers, in the period from 1990 to 2004. The total damage for all the defendant banks is assessed for the purpose of the action at approx. NIS 1 billion, with no allocation between them. On October 7, 2009, the District Court instructed that the hearing of this claim should be incorporated with the claim discussed in item 4.4 below. A motion for approval of a compromise arrangement between the parties was filed with the Court on November 16, 2014. The Court instructed the publication of an announcement regarding the filing of a motion for approval of a compromise arrangement and the submission of the motion to the Attorney General of the Government, to the Antitrust Commissioner and to the Courts Administrator. On November 27, 2014, a notice was published regarding the filing of a motion for approval of a compromise agreement. The response of the Attorney General to the Government was submitted on April 15, 2015, according to which the compromise arrangement should not be approved, and within the framework of which, among other things, the Attorney General expressed reservations as to the amount of compensation to the Plaintiffs and as to the lawyers' fees. He also suggested to the Court to consider the appointment of an examiner who would assess the value of the claim as against the value of an arrangement to the group and would assist the Court in evaluating the fairness of the proposed compromise. A preliminary hearing was held on April 16, 2015, within the framework of which it has been decided that the banks would submit an amended version of a compromise arrangement, and that the Attorney General for the Government would submit what possibilities are available to an examiner in order to assess the damage. The Attorney General for the Government submitted to the Court on May 3, 2015, his position, as stated above. The Banks shall submit their response as well as an amended version of a compromise arrangement until May 21, 2015. The payment to be made in accordance with the compromise arrangement, if and when approved, shall be made out of funds transferred in accordance with the agreed Order, see item 6 hereunder. 8. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND SPECIAL COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED) B. Contingent liabilities and other special commitments (continued) Israel Discount Bank Limited and its Subsidiaries 4.4 Note 19 C 12.5 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described an action together with a motion for the approval of the action as a class action suit, filed on June 30, 2008, against the Bank, Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi, submitted to the Tel Aviv District Court. The core issue of the suit rests on the Plaintiffs' claim that, since the end of the 1990's and possibly even earlier, the three defendant banks created a cartel coordinating the prices of commissions charged to their customers. The Plaintiffs further claim that the banks have created an unlawful restrictive business practice regarding the rates of the various commissions charged to customers. As alleged by the Plaintiffs, as a result of the cartel, the price paid by the public is higher than the price that would have been paid had competition not been prevented by the cartel. The Plaintiff estimates the gap between commissions actually charged and the commissions that would have been charged had the banks not acted as they did, at 25%. Based on this assessment, the Plaintiffs claim an overall damage for all member of the group of NIS 3.5 billion. The Bank's share in the claimed amount is 22% (namely an amount of approx. NIS 770 million). According to the decision of the District Court of October 7, 2009, the claim will be heard together with the claim described in item 4.3 above. For details regarding a compromise arrangement submitted for approval of the Court, regarding the position of the Attorney General to the Government submitted to the Court and with respect to decisions made at the preliminary hearing held on April 16, 2015, see item 4.3 above. The payment to be made in accordance with the compromise arrangement, if and when approved, shall be made out of funds deposited in accordance with the agreed Order (see item 6 hereunder). 4.5 Note 19 C 12.7 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described a lawsuit submitted on October 11, 2012, to the Tel Aviv District Court, against the Bank, FIBI, Leumi Bank and Mizrahi Bank together with a motion for approval of the suit as a class action suit. The matter of the lawsuit is the value date attributed by the banks to payments made by debtors directly to their account at the Debt Execution Office. As alleged by the Claimants, the practice of the banks is to determine the date on which payments have been received as the value date for these payments from the Debt Execution Office. In respect of the said time difference, the banks charge the debtors with interest in arrears. The Claimants argue that at this stage it is not possible to assess the amount of the claim, since in order to do so, specific examinations would have to be made at the banks. On March 10, 2014 the Bank`s response was filed. A preliminary hearing in the case was held on September 14, 2014. In view of the standpoint of the Respondents, according to which the issue of the delay in the transfer of the funds lies with the Debt Execution Office, the Court decided that the claims briefs would be delivered to the Attorney General of the Government and to the Supervisor of Banks, in order to obtain their position in this matter. The Attorney General for the Government submitted his position on February 2, 2015, according to which a winning bank may not charge the account of a customer with interest in respect of the period from date of deposit of a payment with the Execution Office and until it is transferred over to the bank. At a preliminary hearing held on April 19, 2015, the Court proposed to the banks to appoint a neutral public accountant, who would make a sample test of closed files of the Debt Execution Office, in order to determine whether any damage had been caused. The Court further proposed to the banks to consider submission of a third party notice against the Enforcement and Collection Authority. A further preliminary hearing was fixed for June 21, 2015. 4.6 Note 19 C 12.12 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described a lawsuit filed on August 28, 2013, with the Tel Aviv District Court, against the Bank, Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank, the First International Bank and against the General Managers of the said banks, as well as a motion for the approval of the lawsuit as a class action suit. The Claimants allege that the respondent banks unlawfully charge a commission on the conversion and transfer of foreign currency with no proper disclosure to their customers. They claim that a customer who wishes to convert foreign currency is being charged an additional commission to that listed on the transaction price list, which, as alleged, is the difference between the rate at which the respondents buy foreign currency on the inter-bank market and the rate at which they sell the foreign currency to the customer. The Claimant stated the amount of the claim from all the Respondents and for all class members at NIS 10.5 billion. Financial Statements CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AT MARCH 31, 2015 8. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND SPECIAL COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED) B. Contingent liabilities and other special commitments (continued) On January 26, 2014, the Court admitted the preliminary motions submitted in this case, including the motion by the Appellants for withdrawal of the suit against the general managers of the banks. An amended motion for the approval of the suit as a class action suit, was filed on February 4, 2014 and the amount of the claim was set at NIS 11.15 billion. On May 4, 2014, the Court decided that this motion will be heard together with the motion described in item 12.16 in the financial statements as of December 31, 2014. The Bank submitted on December 23, 2014, its response to the motion for approval of the claim as a class action suit. On August 10, 2014, a motion was filed for the consolidation of the hearing of this case with that of the case described in item 5.2 below. The response of the bank to the motion for the merger of the hearings was filed on January 8, 2015. A preliminary hearing has been set for March 8, 2015. At a preliminary hearing of the case, held on March 8, 2015, the Court ruled that the Appellants in this case and in the case described in item 5.2 below, shall submit within sixty days new motions for approval. Within sixty days following the submission of the new motions, the Respondents have to file a response. Following the filing of the claims briefs, the Court will rule in the matter of combining the hearing of the case with the proceedings described in item 5.2 below. A further preliminary hearing was fixed for October 25, 2015. 4.7 Note 19 C 12.14 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described a lawsuit lodged on October 30, 2013, with the Jerusalem District Court together with a motion for its approval as a class action suit, against the Bank, Mercantile Discount Bank, Bank Hapoalim, Union Bank and FIBI. The Plaintiffs argue that the respondent banks charge their customers upon renewal of credit facilities, with a commission in respect of credit and collateral handling, despite the fact that the collateral in respect of the credit facility remains unchanged. The Plaintiffs assess the cumulative amount of the claim against all respondent banks for all class members at NIS 2 billion, and estimated the Bank's share at NIS 498 million and share of MDB at NIS 195 million. On March 5, 2015, a verdict was given according to which the motion for approval of the suit as a class action suit was dismissed. On May 13, 2015, the Bank received information as regards an appeal that had been submitted against the said Court ruling. At date of bringing the report to print, the appeal brief had not yet been delivered to the Bank or to MDB. 4.8 Note 19 C 13.2 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described a lawsuit against Mercantile Discount Bank together with a motion for its approval as a class action suit which were filed with the Tel Aviv District Court on January 5, 2014. The Appellant claims that following the entry into effect of Proper Conduct of Banking Business Directive No. 325, MDB has unilaterally raised the interest rate on credit granted to its customers within the approved credit facility that had been agreed with the customers, and this after the customer had already borrowed funds from MDB within the framework of the credit facility allotted to him and on its basis. The group which the Appellant wishes to represent is defined as \\\"all customers of Mercantile Discount Bank Ltd., who have a credit facility renewable on a quarterly basis, and which, between the years 2007 to 2013, were charged with interest for utilizing the credit facility at a rate exceeding the rate agreed with them according to the last credit facility agreement signed by them with the bank\\\". The Appellant states the amount of the claim in respect of all group members at NIS 139 million. The response of MDB was submitted on July 24, 2014. The Appellant filed a response to the Bank's response, which may be seen as expanding the case matter. MDB has filed a motion for the dismissal of this response. On February 22, 2015, the Court decided that in view of the position of the Appellant, that there is no need for an amendment of the claims briefs, the contents of the claims briefs shall remain as-is. MDB is entitled to file a response to the counter response and all the arguments of the parties shall remain intact and shall be heard within the framework of the hearing of the motion for approval of the suit as a class action suit. The parties agreed to refer the case to mediation and therefore hearing of the evidence has been deferred to October 11, 2015. 8. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND SPECIAL COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED) B. Contingent liabilities and other special commitments (continued) Israel Discount Bank Limited and its Subsidiaries 4.9 Note 19 C 12.15 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described a lawsuit filed with the Tel Aviv-Jaffa District Court on January 30, 2014, against the Bank and against ICC together with a motion for approval of the lawsuit as a class action suit. The Appellant claims that ICC charges on a monthly basis the accounts of holders of \\\"Active\\\" credit cards, in respect of charge amounts accumulated through use of the card, with a minimum amount only determined by ICC. The remainder of the said charge amounts turns into a loan carrying especially high interest rates. It is further alleged that upon the marketing of the plan, ICC refrained from emphasizing to the customers that cancellation of the credit requires an explicit request by the customer as well as from stating the cost of the credit granted. The Appellant claims that operating a revolving credit mechanism with respect to the customers and charging them with interest, has been made with no effective contractual basis and with the impairment of the customers' autonomy. The Appellant stated the amount of the claim in respect of all group members at NIS 2,225 million. A decision dismissing the claim against the Bank was given on August 19, 2014. The case against ICC continues. On October 21, 2014, an appeal was filed with the Supreme Court against the decision of the District Court to dismiss in limine the motion for approval against the Bank. The appeal has been fixed for oral complementary arguments on October 8, 2015, following the submission of summing-up briefs by the parties. ICC submitted its response to the motion on November 10, 2014. On December 21, 2014, the Appellant submitted his response to the comments of ICC. On October 29, 2014, ICC motioned for the stay of proceedings at the District Court until a ruling is given by the Supreme Court in an appeal filed by the Appellant. The preliminary hearing of the case was fixed for June 28, 2015. Within the framework of this hearing, the Court will also consider the request of ICC to stay the proceedings until a ruling is given in the appeal filed with the Supreme Court. 4.10 Note 19 C 13.3 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described a lawsuit filed on March 4, 2014, against the Bank with the Central-Lod District Court, together with a motion for its approval as a class action suit. According to the Appellant, the Bank allows customers to deviate from their approved credit facility in contradiction of Proper Conduct of Banking Business Directive No. 325, thus causing them to pay high and the maximum interest rates in respect of the deviation from their approved credit facility. It is further claimed that the Bank charges the customers account with a commission in respect of notice as to the deviation and/or a warning letter regarding such deviation. The Appellant notes that he is unable to quote an exact amount in respect of the damage caused, but in his opinion this amounts to hundreds of millions of NIS. The Claimant has filed additional class actions on similar grounds and, in accordance with the Court's ruling from June 12, 2014, the additional lawsuits will be heard together with the claim described in this item. The Bank filed its response on October 5, 2014. In a preliminary hearing held on March 26, 2015, the case was deferred for an additional preliminary hearing on October 15, 2015, in presence of the Declarers on behalf of the parties, and within the framework of which, the factual disputes would be discussed by the parties. 4.11 Note 19 C 12.17 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described a lawsuit filed on April 28, 2014, with the District Court Central Region against ICC and others, together with a motion for its approval as a class action suit. The above motion raises the allegation for two binding arrangements in the field of immediate debit cards (\\\"debit\\\") and pre paid cards (\\\"prepaid\\\"), which, as alleged by the Plaintiffs, constitute \\\"a systematic and continuous deceit\\\" of customers of the credit card companies. The Plaintiffs claim that the first binding arrangement is an arrangement for the charging of a cross commission in respect of transactions made through the use of debit or pre paid cards. As regards the second binding arrangement, the Plaintiffs claim that it involves the unlawful withholding of monies due to trading houses, in respect of transactions made by debit cards and pre-paid cards, for a period of twenty days, following the date of collection of the money by the credit card companies. The class of those directly affected, whom the Plaintiffs wish to represent, is defined as \\\"all trading houses in Israel which accept debit cards\\\". The class of those indirectly affected, whom the Plaintiffs wish to represent, is defined as \\\"anyone who purchased goods or services at trading houses that accept debit cards, including the Plaintiffs\\\". The Plaintiffs assess the amount of the claim against all defendants and in respect of all class members at NIS 1,736 million. On February 24, 2015, a motion for withdrawal from the claim was filed. Financial Statements CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AT MARCH 31, 2015 8. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND SPECIAL COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED) B. Contingent liabilities and other special commitments (continued) A motion was filed with the Court on April 19, 2015, requesting the replacement of the parties applying for a withdrawal and their representatives by the Appellant and his representatives and to instruct the continuation of the proceedings by the Appellant and his representatives. The Court had instructed the submission of an amended withdrawal motion, which was filed on May 11, 2015. 5. Class action suits and requests to approve certain actions as class action suits as well as other actions are pending against the Bank and its consolidated subsidiaries, which, in the opinion of the Bank's Management, based on legal opinions and/or on the opinion of managements of its consolidated subsidiaries, which are based on the opinions of their legal counsels, respectively, as the case may be, it is not possible at this stage to evaluate their prospects of success, and therefore no provision have been included in respect therewith. 5.1 Note 19 C 13.1 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described a petition for approval of an action as a class action suit filed with the Tel Aviv District Court On June 19, 2000 by two borrowers of DMB against DMB and against the Israel Phoenix Insurance Co. Ltd., where the properties of the borrowers are insured. The action is for the amount of NIS 105 million (on June 28, 2012, Discount Mortgage Bank was merged with and into the Bank). The borrowers claim, inter alia, that DMB has insured their properties for amounts which exceed their reinstatement value, and that the sum insured was increased in excess of the increase in the Consumer Price Index. On December 25, 2000, the Court decided that whereas the arguments in this case are similar to those argued in another class action suit, as described in item 12.1 to Note 19 C to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, the hearing of the said case will be postponed until a decision is given in the other case. On December 5, 2011, the Court that hears the other motion, gave the compromise agreement the validity of a Court verdict between the parties. 5.2 Note 19 C 13.4 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described a claim together with a motion for its approval as a class-action suit, filed on August 5, 2014, with the Tel Aviv-Jaffa District Court, against the Bank, against MDB and against other banks. The Appellant is alleging that the respondent banks charge foreign currency transfer and handling commissions contrary to the Banking Rules and contrary to the Antitrust Law. The banks, it is alleged, charge the aforesaid commissions on a graded scale, with the grade being determined according to the size of the amount transferred. The Appellant alleges that this is a binding agreement \\\"tacitly\\\" agreed to by the banks; in addition, it is alleged that some of the respondent banks do not disclose the amount of the commission and/or the way it is calculated. The group that the Appellant is seeking to represent is defined as \\\"persons or entities that have made use of bank services for the transfer of foreign currency and/or other dealings in foreign currency and the entire Israeli public, who have been directly and indirectly harmed by the infringements\\\". The Appellant has set the aggregate amount of the claim against all respondent banks at NIS 3 billion or, alternatively, at an amount of at least NIS 1.5 billion. Moreover, a motion has been filed to unite the hearing of this motion with the motions described in item 4.6 above. The response of the banks to the motion for the merger of the hearings was filed on January 8, 2015. The response of the banks to the motion for approval was submitted on February 25, 2015. At a preliminary hearing of the case, held on March 8, 2015, the Court ruled that the Appellants in this case and in the case described in item 4.6 above, shall submit within sixty days new motions for approval. Within sixty days following the submission of the new motions, the Respondents have to file a response. Following the filing of the claims briefs, the Court will rule in the matter of combining the hearing of the case with the proceedings described in item 4.6 above. An amended motion for approval of the suit as a class action suit was filed on April 27, 2015. A further preliminary hearing was fixed for October 25, 2015. 5.3 Note 19 C 13.5 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014, described a lawsuit filed against the Bank on October 19, 2014, with the Central-Lod District Court, together with a motion for its approval as a class action suit. Israel Discount Bank Limited and its Subsidiaries 8. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND SPECIAL COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED) B. Contingent liabilities and other special commitments (continued) The Claimant argues that in violation of the law, the Bank charges its customers an excessive early repayment commission in respect of loans which are not housing loans. It is being argued that the Bank acts in contravention of Proper Conduct of Banking Business Directive No. 454. It was also argued that despite the fact that the Bank is permitted to charge customers with an early repayment commission in an amount reflecting only the damage caused to the Bank, it is the Bank's practice to charge commission fees reflecting considerable profit. The Claimant stated that it is unable to estimate the amount of the damage caused. An agreed motion for a procedural agreement was filed on February 18, 2015, according to which, the Appellant will file a motion for amendment of the motion for approval. The Bank's response to the original motion or to the amended motion shall be filed within 90 days from date of the ruling by the Court in the matter of the motion for amendment. 5.4 A lawsuit was filed against the Bank on May 4, 2015, with the Tel Aviv District Court together with a motion for its approval as a class action suit. The subject of the motion is the alleged charging of excess interest on housing loans. The Claimant argues that the Bank computes the monthly interest by dividing the agreed annual interest by twelve. According to the Claimant, this method of computation leads to the charging of higher interest than the interest that would have been charged had the Bank made a correct calculation. The interest charged by the Bank, as argued by the Claimant, reflects compound interest in contradiction to the law and to agreements signed with customers. The Claimant assesses the amount of the claim for all class members at NIS 80 million. 6. Note 19 C 14 to the financial statements as of December 31, 2013, described the decision of the Antitrust Commissioner regarding binding arrangements between banks, following an investigation conducted since 2004 by the Antitrust Authority. On April 26, 2009, the Antitrust Commissioner (\\\"the Commissioner\\\") issued a statement under Section 43(a)(1) of the Antitrust Act, 1988, according to which binding arrangements existed between Bank Hapoalim B.M., Bank Leumi Le-Israel B.M., Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank, the First International bank of Israel Ltd. and the Bank (hereinafter: \\\"the banks\\\"), in the matter of communication of information regarding commissions (\\\"the Commissioner's Statement\\\"). Under Section 43(e) of the Antitrust Law, the Commissioner's statement serves as prima facie evidence for its contents in any legal proceedings. In the wake of the publication of the Statement, the Bank and the other banks submitted appeals against the Commissioner's statement. On June 16, 2014 the Antitrust Tribunal approved the agreed order signed between the banks and the Commissioner (\\\"the agreed order\\\"), whereby it is determined that the banks would pay an amount of NIS 70 million, of which an amount of NIS 14 million to be paid by Discount Bank (\\\"the payment\\\"), and this without the banks admitting their liability under the provisions of the law or admitting a violation on their part of the provisions of the law. In view of the approval of the agreed order by the Antitrust Tribunal and to the deposit of the payment by the banks, the Commissioner's statement was cancelled and no enforcement measures would be taken against the banks in connection with the investigation that had led to the publication of the decision. It has been determined, within the framework of the agreed order, that the payment may be used for compromise arrangements that might be reached by the banks as regards class actions that are pending against them, and which are detailed in the agreed order. The balance of the payment, which would remain at the end of twenty-four months from date of approval of the agreed order, shall be assigned to the State's Treasury. 7. Agreement between the Swiss Authorities and the U.S. Department of Justice. On August 29, 2013, an agreement between the Swiss Authorities and the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the program for the settlement of disputes was published regarding deposits of U.S. citizens with Swiss banks (Program for Non-Prosecution Agreements or Non-Target Letters for Swiss Banks). The program differentiates between a number of categories. Category No. 1 includes banks being under investigation or proceedings with the U.S. Department of Justice. According to publications, this category includes fourteen banks and such banks are not permitted to participate in the program. It should be noted that IDB (Swiss) is not under investigation or other proceedings by the U.S. Department of Justice. Financial Statements CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AT MARCH 31, 2015 8. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND SPECIAL COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED) B. Contingent liabilities and other special commitments (continued) Category No. 2 is designed for banks that assume the existence of a possibility of effecting violations as detailed in the program. According to the program, banks wishing to be included in this category, could have applied to the U.S. Department of Justice until December 31, 2013, for an agreement for avoiding criminal charges against the bank (Non-Prosecution Agreement), and this only after the Justice Department receives and studies a report of an independent examiner submitted by the applying bank, and subject to the consent of the applying bank to pay a fine in an amount derived from the amount of funds deposited with it by its U.S. customers during the period relevant to the program. Category No. 3 is designed for banks that declare and commit that they had not effected violations as detailed in the program. Banks that wished to be included in this category had to apply to the U.S. Department of Justice from July 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, for conformation that they are not targeted for enforcement actions by it (Non-Target letter). As stated in the program, if it is found retroactively that the examination report does not support the original declaration, the case would be handled at the discretion of the U.S. Department of Justice. The said alternatives of the program require the delivery to the U.S. Department of Justice of information of various scopes, where in the case of Category No. 2 (non-prosecution agreement) detailed information regarding the said accounts will be required. Following an examination of the plan and relying, among other things, on outside legal advice rendered to IDB (Swiss) Bank, the Bank and IDB (Swiss) Bank decided not to join the plan. To the extent that IDB (Swiss) Bank would have elected to participate in the program under category No. 2, than the maximum fine computed in accordance with the approach detailed in the Swiss program with respect to all accounts of U.S. persons held by it, would have been reduced in relation to accounts that would have been recognized under the program as tax compliant, or as such which joined the voluntary disclosure program with the encouragement of IDB (Swiss) Bank, or as such that are out of scope of the program. According to the examination of IDB (Swiss), with the assistance of an external consultant, and considering the deductions detailed above, the worst case scenario does not amount to a material sum to the Bank. It is emphasized that in any event, the result of the said review is considered a crude assessment only, due to the fact that the formula in question is not a simple one but a formula requiring specific and complex discussions with the U.S. Justice Department, mostly due to the fact that different reliefs exist under the program, the effect of which is difficult to assess beforehand. The Bank informed IDB (Swiss) Bank that as long as it maintains the control thereof, it is the Bank`s intension to secure the financial ability of IDB (Swiss) Bank to comply with the regulatory requirements in Switzerland, as required for its business activity. Examination and investigation actions by the U.S. Authorities. It has been publicized recently, that Israeli banks find themselves in various stages of examination and investigation processes on the part of the U.S. authorities. It was published on December 22, 2014, that the Bank Leumi Group had reached an arrangement of the \\\"Deferred Prosecution Agreement\\\" type with the U.S. Department of Justice, and also reached an additional arrangement with the Financial Services Authority of the State of New York (hereinafter - \\\"the Leumi arrangement\\\"). According to the arrangement, Bank Leumi admitted conducting a series of operations, the aim of which, according to the publication, was assisting tax evasion by its U.S. customers. According to the arrangement, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to defer the filing of an indictment against the Bank Leumi Group for a period of twenty-four months, during which Bank Leumi is required to abide by the commitments detailed in the agreement. Moreover, various sanctions have been imposed on the Bank Leumi Group, including the payment of a fine in the amount of US$400 million. 8. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND SPECIAL COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED) B. Contingent liabilities and other special commitments (continued) Israel Discount Bank Limited and its Subsidiaries The Bank Leumi arrangement has been presented and discussed at the Bank following its publication. This arrangement is based on specific facts dealing with many and continuous operations attributed to different companies in the Bank Leumi Group and as far as can be discerned from the publications, the agreement had been prepared and formed over a long period of time, with considerable investment of resources and of work time of consultants, the data itself remaining undisclosed. The agreement does not detail the formula for the fine, which determines the amounts that the Bank Leumi Group has agreed to pay, except with respect to the operations of Leumi in Switzerland. It would seem that in part, the amount of the fine had been based on agreements as to the amounts of tax evasion by customers, deriving from and in respect of activities attributed to the Bank Leumi Group. According to the published arrangement, the fine paid by Bank Leumi in respect of its operations in Switzerland, is derived from the formula detailed in the program with respect to category No.2. The Bank has no knowledge of investigative actions taken against the Bank or against any of its extensions by the U.S. authorities, as regards U.S. customers who had not complied with their obligations according to U.S. tax laws. Furthermore, as published, IDB (Swiss) Bank is not one of the corporations included in the category No. 1 of the Swiss program (namely, banks under investigation, which, therefore, may not participate in the Swiss program). The Bank is adopting a series of measures for the management of the risk involved in its operations with its U.S. customers. However, in view of the said enforcement actions and due to the uncertainty existing in this matter, it is not possible to assess to assess the risk involved in these operations.

Additional details regarding significant unobservable inputs and valuation techniques used for the measurement of fair value of items classified to level 3 (continued) Significant unobservable inputs, which were used to measure the fair value of derivative financial instruments, are expectations of inflation up to one year, and adjustments regarding counterparty credit risk (CVA). As the inflation forecasts rise (fall) and the Bank commits to pay the index-linked amount, so the fair value falls (rises). As the inflation forecasts rise (fall) and the counterparty to the transaction is obligated to pay the Bank the index-linked amount, so the fair value rises (falls). The counterparty credit risk coefficient (CVA) expresses the probability of credit default of the counterparty to the transaction. A rise in the default probability reduces the fair value of the transaction, and vice versa. 2. Qualitative information regarding the measurement of fair value at level 3 1.

An agreement with FIBI Holdings - 2010 On March 31, 2015 the Bank's holdings in FIBI were 9.28% in the equity and in the voting rights. The cost of the shares in the Bank's books amounted to NIS 527 million as of March 31, 2015. The market value of the Bank's holdings in FIBI totaled on March 31, 2015: NIS 509 million. The market value of this investment at May 17, 2015: NIS 492 million. The Bank and FIBI Holdings signed an agreement on March 28, 2010, which, among other things, limited the period in which Discount Bank shall have the right by which FIBI Holdings shall continue to support the appointment of one quarter of the directions of FIBI from among candidates recommended by Discount Bank. Details regarding the highlights of the agreement and regarding the approvals of the Supervisor of Banks and the Antitrust Commissioner with respect to the agreement, including the timetable determined by the Antitrust Commissioner for the reduction in the interest held by Discount Bank in FIBI, were brought in Note 6 D (1) to the financial statements as of December 31, 2014. C. Sale of shares in February 2015. On February 19, 2015, the Bank sold 7,054,625 shares of FIBI, comprising approx. 7% of the share capital of FIBI. The balance of the shares in the First International Bank held by the Bank comprises 9.28% of the share capital of FIBI. The sale was made in an offmarket transaction, at a price of NIS 0.4951 per share, reflecting a discount of 2.5% on the base price for the February 19 trading day. The total consideration amounted to NIS 349 million. In consequence of this sale and the decrease in the Bank's rate of holdings in the shares of FIBI to below 10%, the exceptional impact of the investment in these shares on capital adequacy has been removed, a fact that brought about an improvement in capital adequacy already in the first quarter of 2015. Completion of this move constitutes the Bank's attainment of a relevant milestone in the sale outline determined by the Antitrust Commissioner, prior to the final date that had been fixed for this sale. In respect of the above, a loss on impairment of a nature other than temporary (OTTI) in the amount of NIS 47 million, net, was recorded in the financial statements as of December 31, 2014. A. Data regarding the investment in FIBI Agreement with Bank Otsar Ha-Hayal. An agreement was signed on March 31, 2015, between ICC and Diners and Bank Otsar Ha-Hayal Ltd. (hereinafter: \\\"Otsar Ha-Hayal\\\"; \\\"the agreement\\\"). The agreement is for a period of five years since date of signature, and would be extended for further periods of five years each, unless one of the parties informed the other party, six months prior to the end of the agreement period, of his wish not to extend the agreement for an additional period. Within the framework of the agreement, ICC and Diners would issue credit cards to Otsar Ha-Hayal customers and would provide them with the services involved in the issue of the cards and inherent in the use thereof. The agreement establishes the rights of the parties as well as the operating arrangements and the provision of services by ICC and/or Diners in respect of the charge cards issued in terms of the agreement and the remaining terms relating thereto. B. (1) Events regarding the clearing of international electronic trade transactions and other matters. In the second half of 2009 and in the beginning of 2010, ICC faced allegations made by VISA Europe and the Global MasterCard Organization (hereinafter: \\\"the international organizations\\\") with respect to prima facie violations of the rules of these organizations pertaining to the clearing of international electronic trade, in transactions effected by a subsidiary of ICC, ICC International (which had in the meantime been merged with and into ICC). In this framework, fines have been imposed on ICC and its activity in this field of operations has been restricted for a period of several months. ICC has immediately implemented a reduction plan in order to comply with the requirements of the international organizations, in the framework of which it applied various measures, including changes in the company's management.
