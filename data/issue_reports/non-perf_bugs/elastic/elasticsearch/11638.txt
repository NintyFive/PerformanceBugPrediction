This is especially useful for the .NET client, since we rely on the spec to generate the respective C# methods for each query parameter.  Without them defined, we have to modify our code generator to include them manually.\n\nI'm not sure how this would fit into the current spec since we define query parameters on a per endpoint basis...but we could think of something.  Maybe a  single `_global.json` file?\n\nJust a thought.  If others agree that this is a good idea, I'd be happy to devise some solution.\n","closed_by":{"login":"gmarz","id":1594777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQ3Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1594777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz","html_url":"https://github.com/gmarz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gmarz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
