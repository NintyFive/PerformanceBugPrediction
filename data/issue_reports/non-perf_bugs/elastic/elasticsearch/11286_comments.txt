Theses cluster blocks did not exist in 1.3.2 and that's why you saw a different behavior, the `ClusterBlockException`, in 1.5.2. Unfortunately some cluster blocks were not fine grain enough and block some endpoints like `/_aliases`, `/_settings`... #9203 add more precise cluster blocks level and fixed that.\n\nI'm closing this issue since it will be resolved by the upcoming 1.6 release.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
