The heap usage on nodes hit 98%.  The heap itself is showing mostly segment readers with FSTs in them loaded via searches:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7216393/8445344/b5e05680-1f50-11e5-83e6-aaa5a9c80509.png)\n\nCurrently, all FSTs for a field are loaded into the heap when the field is requested via search.  This makes me wonder if there's potentially a protection mechanism we can put in place to prevent the FSTs from consuming all of the heap.  Some kind of a cap and/or a way to evict them would be nice.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
