The `term`  filter has been removed in master (all filters are now queries), but I have a sneaking suspicion that parsing of the `term` query goes haywire after it encounters the array. (eg the exception from this query indicates some other problem): \n\n```\nGET /_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"should\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": {\n            \"foo\": [\n              \"two\",\n              \"one\"\n            ]\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"term\": {\n            \"foo\": [\n              \"two\",\n              \"one\"\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEither way, a better exception would be nice.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
