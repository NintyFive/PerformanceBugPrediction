Two things happened: 1) the test I wrote for the huge terms actually did not trigger the exception on 1.x because on 1.x this only happens with certain queries like prefix query but not match query (which I use in the test) and 2) I fixed the issue by catching a MaxBytesLengthExceededException in PlainHighlighter but on 1.x this is actually wrapped in a RuntimeException. So this did not fix it on 1.x but the tests passed anyway. I made a pull request to change this now here #11683.
