The important part for me was to point out the usage of \"indices.\" as node level settings which related to indices. \n\nAs far as the name collision goes - I wonder how many people use the current query cache (i.e. shard requests caching) and thus how bad it would be to make a breaking change and change the semantics of that settings.\n\nAnother alternative, which I'm on the fence about but think it's worth mentioning, is using the word segments in the name  - as the queries are cached on a segment level.
