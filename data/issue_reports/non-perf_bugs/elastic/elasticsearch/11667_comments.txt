My apologies.\n\nHowever, when you say:\n\n> I am searching for free text, not binded to any field\n\n... this is not what you are doing.  If you don't specify a field, then you are querying the `_all` field, which contains the values of all fields concatenated as one big string.   This is why various fields get highlighted.  Instead, try querying just the fields that you want to query, along with setting `require_field_match` to true.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/113234959","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11667#issuecomment-113234959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11667","id":113234959,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzIzNDk1OQ==","user":{"login":"litalk","id":12840751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODQwNzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12840751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/litalk","html_url":"https://github.com/litalk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litalk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litalk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litalk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litalk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litalk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litalk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litalk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litalk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/litalk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-18T17:50:01Z","updated_at":"2015-06-18T17:50:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"But this is not my use case. \nI don't always know the specific fields in my application.
