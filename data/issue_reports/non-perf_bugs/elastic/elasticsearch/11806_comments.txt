In those cases I would like to be informed if I picked an incorrect field, since those fields allow to do somewhat more advanced search features instead of simple matching.\n\nI'm unsure about simple term / match queries etc. and what to do if the field doesn't exist in the mapping. Today the parser just create a kind of a raw term query, instead of returning all or no results or fail. I think this behaviour is historic as mapping updates used to be async (in 1.x and before), so a field may not exist in the mapping yet will the document did successfully indexed.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/117951880","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11806#issuecomment-117951880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11806","id":117951880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzk1MTg4MA==","user":{"login":"kmeiresonne","id":13147453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTQ3NDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13147453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmeiresonne","html_url":"https://github.com/kmeiresonne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmeiresonne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmeiresonne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmeiresonne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmeiresonne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmeiresonne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmeiresonne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmeiresonne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmeiresonne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmeiresonne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-02T08:07:11Z","updated_at":"2015-07-02T08:07:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Should this be top-level or per query/agg? (more control if the latter)\n\nI believe a top-level control should be possible.
