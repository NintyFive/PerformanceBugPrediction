I still feel, it's good to have feature as there are no efficient alternatives present. Let me explain my use case for this in few sentences,\n1. We have ten thousands of apps. Each app has 100's of documents and indexed as a type.\n2. Each app has differently structured documents and so different field mappings as well. These mapping may change at any time. When mapping changes, we have to reindex the app.\n\nRight now we are deleting the type first and then reindexing to the same type. Due to this we see \"zero results\" or \"fewer results\" for one or two seconds (during indexing period). We want to avoid this.\n\nIf alias for type existed, i could've indexed into different type and then made alias for actual type name.\n\n Is there a better way to achieve this with current elasticsearch itself? \n\nThanks.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/117134300","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11905#issuecomment-117134300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11905","id":117134300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzEzNDMwMA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-30T11:28:21Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T11:28:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @msathis \n\nI've closed this ticket because: (1) we no longer support delete-mapping and (2) we're trying to simplify mappings, rather than make them more complicated (and thus more prone to bugs).\n\nYou can read more about the changes coming in mappings here: https://www.elastic.co/blog/great-mapping-refactoring along with some suggestions for modelling your data.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/117518119","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11905#issuecomment-117518119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11905","id":117518119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzUxODExOQ==","user":{"login":"msathis","id":2977899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5Nzc4OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2977899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msathis","html_url":"https://github.com/msathis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msathis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msathis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msathis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msathis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msathis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msathis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msathis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msathis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msathis/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T08:05:08Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T08:05:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @clintongormley .
