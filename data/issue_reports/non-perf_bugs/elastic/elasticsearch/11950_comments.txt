Here's some more information about the configuration:\n\nWe are using the HTTP client, communicating over TCP 9200. We have 2 elasticsearch server nodes in a clustered configuration (both VMs running with 2 cores @ 2.5GHz and 12GB RAM). This is all hosted in a data centre, and our client (the micro service I mentioned) is on yet another VM also within the same DC. These VMs are either on the same server, or a different rack server, but in the same rack. Just checked with the infrastructure guys and we aren't oversubscribed on any resources on these production boxes.\n\nWith regards to the network connectivity, they are co-located so I would be surprised if this were the issue. DNS resolution is also not an issue as the DNS server is next to them as well. \n\nI was wondering if it might be a connection pooling issue? We are using the ElasticClient with the `SniffingConnectionPool`. I must admit my hunch was towards the client (mainly because of the server logs showing great performance on the main cluster).\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/117539614","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11950#issuecomment-117539614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11950","id":117539614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzUzOTYxNA==","user":{"login":"mikezopa","id":10807937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA3OTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10807937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikezopa","html_url":"https://github.com/mikezopa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikezopa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikezopa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikezopa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikezopa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikezopa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikezopa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikezopa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikezopa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikezopa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T08:37:33Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T08:37:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @clintongormley,\n\nReally sorry, I just realised I have opened this issue against Elasticsearch instead of the .NET elasticsearch client!
