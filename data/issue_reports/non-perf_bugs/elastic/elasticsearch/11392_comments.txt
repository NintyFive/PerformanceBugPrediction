In Java, a `float` can represent values <= `2^23` without losing precision. Both `2144409647` and `2144397647` are > `2^23`, hence the loss in precision. You should not see the loss of precision if you use `weight` <= `2^23`.\nOne way to avoid this precision loss is to return `weight` as a `double` instead, I will open an issue for this.\n\n@clintongormley this is not related to completion suggester, but how the scores are handled after.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/106713432","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11392#issuecomment-106713432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11392","id":106713432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjcxMzQzMg==","user":{"login":"malthe","id":26405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe","html_url":"https://github.com/malthe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T06:58:53Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T06:58:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@areek ah that's what's happening.
