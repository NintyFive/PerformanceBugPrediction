that's somehow what maven is good at. \nThat said, too many libs are still included in cloud plugins. A global workaround would be to mark all elasticsearch core dependencies as `provided` in `plugins/pom.xml`. In that case, shared libs won't be included in the plugin distribution as maven will resolve that.\n\n@rmuir I understand that you are not a fan of this and the reasons you are against this.\nTo me it's a tradeoff between `plugin.xml` complexity and the risk of missing something. It looks super easy for simple plugins like analysis but more complex for cloud plugins.\nI can give a try to your solution though and see where is goes.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/112020138","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11647#issuecomment-112020138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11647","id":112020138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjAyMDEzOA==","user":{"login":"dadoonet","id":274222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/274222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet","html_url":"https://github.com/dadoonet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dadoonet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-15T11:11:08Z","updated_at":"2015-06-15T11:11:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ha.

@rmuir I understand that you are not a fan of this and the reasons you are against this.\n> To me it's a tradeoff between plugin.xml complexity and the risk of missing something.\n\nI think maven's transitive dependency mechanism is _broken_ here either way.\n\nThe way i see it, there are two choices:\n1 manually maintain list of all transitive dependencies for elasticsearch/lucene/anything else ES brings in \n2 manually maintain list of all dependencies for each plugin.\n\nGiven those two choices, I argue that 2 is easier than 1. It is also easier to reason about: you specify exactly what should be in the zip, versus trying to navigate through tons of confusing maven dependencies to figure out why something that should not be there..\n\nSo i am not insisting on number 2...

If we bring in ElasticSearch, say via Gradle, then we end up with all the versions it uses of many libraries all possible conflicting with other frameworks and even our application code.  All to get access to the client, or to run embedded ES.  And now to resolve it, the application has to shade things of its own to avoid unknown failures happening in ES which probably requires more specific and well tested versions of things  But on accident, if they don't know all this, their Gradle will change version numbers used to the most recent, causing unknown failures, silent or obvious.  And if they want to fix it, the only place they really can then is shading their application's usage, and hope that the somewhat-not-really-maintained-with-every-feature Gradle Shadow plugin can handle only shading the right things and not mucking up others.  And when you add that plugin, then you might have issues with Gradle Application plugin knowing to use a partial Uber JAR with some shaded things, then other JARs that were left untouched (if even possible), and whack-bam-fun-and-games you are in a new hell.  \n\nup until now, ElasticSearch was one library you could include that didn't screw you over.  Now we get to play games with it and a longer list of dependencies!  \n\nObviously this issue was from the viewpoint of the creators of ES, and not from the viewpoint of using it as a library.  Or am I missing some magical benefit this provides?  I only see problems.  \n\nbtw, I think you broke some plugins on Master, cloud-was doesn't register s3 repos anymore.\n\n```\norg.elasticsearch.common.inject.CreationException: Guice creation
