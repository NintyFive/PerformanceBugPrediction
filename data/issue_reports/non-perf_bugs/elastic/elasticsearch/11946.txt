now fail on ES startup if we detect jar hell (which we should keep), but I think we can probably factor out the logic to a method that takes URL[]. pluginmanager could then pass classpath of current plugins, and add the \"candidate\" classpath from the plugin to-be-installed.\n\nIdeally we do all of this before touching the filesystem, so the plugin installation just fails but the overall ES installation stays working.\n\nI will try to make a
