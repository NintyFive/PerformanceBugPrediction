Really this feels like a logstash configuration issue, rather than a problem with Elasticsearch. \n\nI'd ask on the forums instead: https://discuss.elastic.co/c/logstash or https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch\n\nOne thing for sure: you don't want to be setting the bulk threads this high - that's just going to put a lot of extra load on the system.  Setting thread pool config is a very expert option, you can easily break things if you set them incorrectly.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/108893917","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11492#issuecomment-108893917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11492","id":108893917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwODg5MzkxNw==","user":{"login":"refaelos","id":986453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjQ1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/986453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos","html_url":"https://github.com/refaelos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-04T13:13:54Z","updated_at":"2015-06-04T13:13:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks man!\n\nI'll put the question on the forum and explain some more about the infrastructure and the data.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/108916021","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11492#issuecomment-108916021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11492","id":108916021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwODkxNjAyMQ==","user":{"login":"refaelos","id":986453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjQ1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/986453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos","html_url":"https://github.com/refaelos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/refaelos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-04T14:32:47Z","updated_at":"2015-06-04T14:32:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Posted it there: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/one-vs-multiple-indices-on-es-using-lss-date-filter\n\nWill be great if you can help.\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
