When somebody new comes in to the project, runs `rake routes`, he/she gets a list of urls the application understands.\n\nElasticsearch is moving fast, and the http API is growing. It would be nice to have some HTTP endpoint which will list all available routes for each of the Elasticsearch APIs (Cluster API health/status, Nodes info API, indices API, Search API and every new feature too).\n\nInstead of chasing the changelog and reading the changed documentation, you call something like `http://localhost:9200/_api_routes` and you will get a nice list of all API urls currently supported by the given Elasticsearch version.\n\nSince this list is autogenerated, there is no risk of going out of sync between the correct urls and the documentation.\n","closed_by":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
