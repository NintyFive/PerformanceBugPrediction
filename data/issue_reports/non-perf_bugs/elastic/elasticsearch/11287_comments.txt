In 1.x we synced every 5 sec. which essentially is an async commit. Now we sync on every high level operation (Single | Bulk) as well as every 5 seconds.\n- we wait for fsync on all replicas before we return the doc to the user not just on the primary which gives additional safety.\n- `index.translog.durability` is set to `request` by default but can also be changed dynamically if async fsyncs are not an issue. \n- if `index.translog.durability: async` guarantees to drop all unsynced data. Since we have checkpoints we only read up to the latest checkpoint, this means we drop everything that has been written but not fsynced. So in the case of a node failure we might loose all docs indexed since the last scheduled sync (5s by default)\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
