In fact this is a duplicate of a very old issue (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/492). Implementation is blocked by the need for a task management framework (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/6914) which will allow long running jobs to be paused, restarted, or cancelled.\n\nAlthough both of these issues are old, this doesn't mean that they have been forgotten.  Both are on the roadmap and we will get to them as soon as we can.\n\nI'm going to close this as a duplicate of #492\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
