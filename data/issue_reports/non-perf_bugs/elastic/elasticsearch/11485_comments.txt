I see what happened here (thx for trying :)).  I was testing various example ymls with different formatting, but also with different file names.  And didn't realize that if I just have 2 .yml files in the config directory, 1 for logging (logging.yml), and 1 for elasticsearch (except that the ES node yml is named something like not-working.yml), then it also will just load the defaults without warning.  \n\nSo you are right, the valid yml syntax within the file is actually working fine if I rename the example ymls back to \"elasticsearch.yml\".  It is just not loading it because the file itself is not called literally \"elasticsearch.yml\".   It will be nice though to write out a logging entry to log file indicating that no elasticsearch.yml is found and that it is going to start the node up with all default settings :)\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/109207930","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11485#issuecomment-109207930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11485","id":109207930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwOTIwNzkzMA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-05T08:57:14Z","updated_at":"2015-06-05T08:57:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing in favour of #11510\n","performed_via_github_app":null}]
