I can think of a scenario where many waiting indexing operations slow down cluster state processing (we try the indexing operation on every cluster state change and can be more efficient.)\n\n> It looks like the great refactoring in 5bdfdc4 may have switched the behavior? If that's the correct behavior,\n\nThis behavior has been there from the beginning time, or something very close to it. The rational is that the needed replicas might be assigned soon and it's worth while waiting (think about a newly create index).   Can you sure more around why you think something changed?\n\n> if you don't have the response is the timeout getting logged, in DEBUG\n>  maybe we can log something in ERROR after N indexing requests have failed consistency check?\n\nThat log message should actually be TRACE as it's may be very high volume (like in your case). I think there is merit to have a logging infra that throttle logging but that would be a separate issue.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/142300526","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11582#issuecomment-142300526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11582","id":142300526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjMwMDUyNg==","user":{"login":"celesteking","id":748075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODA3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/748075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/celesteking","html_url":"https://github.com/celesteking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celesteking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celesteking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celesteking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celesteking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celesteking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celesteking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celesteking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celesteking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celesteking/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-22T14:12:37Z","updated_at":"2015-09-22T14:12:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"started getting same message once server ran out of disk space.\n\nI allocated more, but it didn't go away.

It means ES just received and processed haft past of the number messages that sent from Syslog-ng.\nOf course, I also checked the bandwidth, hdd, ram and cpu. They worked well and just used around 50% their capacity.\n\nMr.Kamakazikamikaze. I found your comment here and I would like you give me some your experience about that.\nDoes has any parameters that I have to config for tuning my system?\n\nThank you very much!\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/161655170","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11582#issuecomment-161655170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11582","id":161655170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTY1NTE3MA==","user":{"login":"clintongormley","id":56599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/56599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley","html_url":"https://github.com/clintongormley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintongormley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-03T14:27:02Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T14:27:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bachkhoabk47 This sounds like a question for the forums (http://discuss.elastic.co/) not for the issues list.\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/161858438","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11582#issuecomment-161858438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11582","id":161858438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTg1ODQzOA==","user":{"login":"bachkhoabk47","id":5723383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjMzODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5723383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachkhoabk47","html_url":"https://github.com/bachkhoabk47","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachkhoabk47/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachkhoabk47/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachkhoabk47/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachkhoabk47/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachkhoabk47/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachkhoabk47/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachkhoabk47/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachkhoabk47/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachkhoabk47/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-04T03:00:36Z","updated_at":"2015-12-04T03:00:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Clintongormley!\nThanks for you feedback. \nI've posted my question to the forums.\nThank you so much\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/comments/374583626","html_url":"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11582#issuecomment-374583626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11582","id":374583626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDU4MzYyNg==","user":{"login":"bleskes","id":1006375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYzNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1006375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes","html_url":"https://github.com/bleskes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bleskes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T12:43:09Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T12:43:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm closing this as it isn't clear what actually happened and we've had no feedback for a while.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
